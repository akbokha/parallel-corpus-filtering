Munich 18@@ 56 : four cards to change your view of the city
a Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt , where young people are meeting today .
a pit chapel , where it is now excav@@ ated for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
petty @-@ gar@@ den@@ ers manage the one @-@ hand reason of farmers .
the oldest official card of Munich supports exciting stories about days .
it can be nervous when maps are out of date .
the one knows each one has had to ex@@ alt itself , because the auto @-@ Nav@@ i showed a green meadow instead of an over@@ walk road .
the historic maps of the digital Bayern @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bavaria of the State government , are far from current - but it is very enligh@@ tening .
especially when you compare them with current online @-@ cards .
then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the spread @-@ area of the Mün@@ chner Mercury since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a spl@@ attered canvas that one does not recognise as such .
in the large picture postcard were collected for towns and municipalities of more detailed maps , so @-@ called Ur@@ posi@@ bility datas@@ he@@ ets .
these were created according to the indications of the Bay@@ erische Ver@@ mess@@ aging government between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and ski@@ pping the first division of Bay@@ erns .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army @-@ leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the second period of war with Austria .
Napoleon had an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographic recording of Bay@@ erns on behalf - of course for military purposes .
even if the French troops mar@@ ched with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville from 9 February 18@@ 01 : there were today &apos;s neighbors , which created the idea of a region @-@ wide region map .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV . Joseph drove the project further , founded the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ o@@ graphical Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and thus the Bay@@ erische Ver@@ mess@@ engers administration &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ur@@ posi@@ bility blatt for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and is to be found at the Bay@@ erische Landes@@ bibliothek all else on the website of the Bay@@ erische Staats@@ bibliothek .
the comparison morning / Today is the example of the provincial capital most impressive .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
an example of this is sub@@ s@@ end@@ ling that appears relatively isolated within the map of 18@@ 56 .
S@@ end@@ ling was built 21 years after the map , i.e. 1877 , as a district of Munich .
today , Unter@@ s@@ end@@ ling is located in the middle of the city .
the houses under@@ score focus on 18@@ 56 along today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße which was named in 1878 to Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader of the Bav@@ arian peasants against Austria 17@@ 05 .
where today is the West@@ park , one sees nothing but fields - at first sight : on the contrary , a small @-@ dis@@ advant@@ aged card with do@@ zens of lines and numbers : hand @-@ written Fl@@ ur@@ ks from the so @-@ called &quot; pri@@ ming , &quot; which was derived from the source tax .
&quot; &quot; &quot; small plots spread there today no farmers more - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the facility &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land in Sun . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large green area stands out north of Unter@@ s@@ end@@ ling .
the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 Schau@@ platz of the Oktober@@ fest , was in fact still a meadow - and no concrete desert .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of the psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the urine sheet , one reads in the area of the present district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen not only the street name &quot; at Gast@@ ei@@ g &quot; or from the height &quot; Tow@@ ards &quot; - but also in big letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld road there was once people with mad@@ vor@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich district @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Au@@ er Lü@@ gen &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from 18@@ 72 Dr. Bernhard von G@@ ud@@ den did the establishment - that psychiat@@ rist , who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwi@@ gs II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and ended for example the accus@@ ation of so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has also banned the staff to apply violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , Head of the Museum of Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who has worked for an exhibition with the institution .
for 280 patients there was first place , later it was extended to 500 places .
sometime this capacity is no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the cycles in hair 1905 .
since 2006 the Is@@ ar @-@ A@@ MP@@ ER @-@ Klin@@ ik@@ um Munich @-@ Ost , one of the largest pel@@ vic atri@@ cians in Germany .
at the end of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt now young people meet in Munich Sal@@ esian F@@ esi@@ an@@ um .
the Order was established in 1920 and took it into a youth @-@ home with training facilities .
west is the football field of the TS@@ V East east , east residential buildings dating from the 1980s .
in 2015 the children @-@ house &quot; Casa don Bosco &quot; was built in an architectural reference to the origin of the Ir@@ vine in the Second World War , which was destroyed by bom@@ bing ra@@ ids during World War II .
the Mari@@ en@@ platz was about 18@@ 56 as the main square , &quot; the merchant road was called &quot; Kauf@@ hof alley . &quot;
the Second World War was a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
the bom@@ bs of the Al@@ lies in December 1944 lots of holes in the city center .
a big remained to this day - at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
the English Institute , small business buildings and a tomb chapel from the Middle Ages were once at the Mari@@ en@@ hof , where these days will be the pres@@ et and on 5 April 2017 the sp@@ ade for the second S @-@ Bahn platform .
with the sli@@ der sli@@ der the old Munich @-@ card can be compared to the air@@ image of today - and the hole at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
citizen @-@ Law published for Mis@@ souri
the National association for the promotion of colour has issued a warning for colored people who travel to Mis@@ souri on the basis of discri@@ min@@ ating politics and rac@@ ist attacks by the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the federal state Mis@@ souri , which will bring special attention to the state by February 28th , as a series of question@@ able , because a number of question@@ able , r@@ allies occur@@ ren@@ ces lately throughout the country and are re@@ marked here &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it is stated in the Group &apos;s statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a recently adopted law by Mis@@ souri , which makes man harder to win discrimination , as well as the prosecution authorities of the state , dis@@ proportionate to minorities , prompted the group to release the travel war@@ time , said the NA@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have violations of civil rights , human beings happen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are hal@@ ted because of their skin colour , they are gathered or killed , &quot; said the President of Mis@@ souri NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not heard yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the US .
the group cited inci@@ dents like rac@@ ist Ver@@ sions against black students at the University of Mis@@ souri and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from T@@ ennes@@ see .
S@@ anders died under fragile circumstances at the beginning of the year after having had no gasoline any more during the journey and by the police of Mis@@ souri in custody without being accused of crimin@@ ality .
the Council also shows a recent report of the Office of the General@@ sta@@ ats@@ u @-@ old of Mis@@ souri , in which it is shown that black drivers in the state will hold 75 percent more frequently than whit@@ ef@@ oot .
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware of and inform their families , friends and staff about what might happen in Mis@@ souri , &quot; said Chapel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must be ready to bring it money or let the relatives know they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ souri posted in 2015 100 hate speech , according to the latest figures from the hate @-@ bre@@ d report of F@@ BI , which increases the state with regard to the number of such violations at the 16th rank of the country .
the travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ souri law which would make it harder to su@@ e a company because of living or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued voy@@ ages for Texas and Arizona , following the states of immigration law , to commit local prosecution authorities to di@@ vul@@ ge people because of immigration .
they are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of other countries , but at the last time stakeholders have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States .
Wei@@ dez@@ v@@ ist project is elementary
the fisher@@ man Wei@@ de@@ magic n @-@ Project is a success project and will continue in the coming year .
the CD@@ U Bundestag Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac gave himself a picture on the spot .
at the rectangle of the family Schwen@@ dem@@ ann , representatives of the fisher@@ man CD@@ U @-@ village together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MEPs .
Markus Schwen@@ dem@@ ann received first insights into his company , in which he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy rice , as well as many young animals and housed in five apartments tourist guests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black @-@ milk &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is for him the alternate mark@@ eter track for the milk of his cows , so Schwen@@ dem@@ ann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the table of the holiday guests are exclusively regi@@ on@@ ales .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as he is also called B@@ L@@ H@@ V @-@ Chairman of fishing bach , he referred to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elem@@ ental project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as elementary &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can not work on such steep surfaces .
the green space for a lot of work , much needed to be processed using the engine sense .
&quot; we have to fight here with the conditions and the top@@ ography , &quot; said Schwen@@ dem@@ ann .
in 2003 he took over the el@@ ter@@ ous operation and engaged this without chemical plant protection and fer@@ til@@ is@@ ers , even if he does not conduct a bio@@ operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commun@@ e has recognized the importance of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dec@@ eption project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and is happy about the leader promotion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the farmers have to support farmers at the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euro per h@@ ect@@ are .
they hope that the for@@ estation of the surfaces could be moved even quite a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest treasure that we have , are people who work in agriculture and make thoughts on how they will continue their operation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers have often been in criticism because of the promotion
over 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013 .
the break surface amounts to 40 h@@ ect@@ are not allowed until at least 20@@ 23 .
of the total cost of 71 500 Euros , half of over the leader was funded , a quarter carried by the municipality of fisher@@ bach .
thus , the farmers had to invest 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of past@@ ure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Schwen@@ dem@@ ann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac stressed : &quot; you are doing a really good job , without farmers and coun@@ seling do not go . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also for Peter Weiss was firm : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here are the best food produced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ s@@ ulation Pur@@ chase ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg allows the state promotion of past@@ ure .
the objective is the offensive of the Black Forest .
prerequisite is the presence of one of the L@@ PR signed conveyor .
in addition , the enclosed area may not be worse ( Hang@@ ing over 35 percent ) and must be threatened by the for@@ estation .
for the fisher@@ man Wei@@ dez@@ v@@ aun@@ ching project , 2018 is currently running the application of eight participants with 24 plots that wish to build just under 16 kilometers from the fence .
the reservation area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 Euro .
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tru@@ mp is taking the Statue of Liberty before
the safest sign of a regime transfer - it is when they begin to att@@ acking the statues .
the Americans appreciate this just as any other - hence the careful fall of Saddam H@@ uss@@ one at the Fir@@ dos square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Mill@@ er , one of the keys @-@ ide@@ ologists of the Tru@@ mp @-@ regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic A@@ xt in a heated dispute with Jim A@@ co@@ sta by CN@@ N on the proposals of the President on the dr@@ astic restriction of legal migration with the Statue of Liberty .
to stay fair , Mill@@ er did not handle the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of boat land@@ owners and Liberty @-@ Im@@ ators could have found him when he had done it .
but he attacked their significance , and in particular the meaning that it was written , when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus , 17 years after the completion of the monument , has been added to its base .
when Mill@@ er A@@ co@@ sta im@@ pe@@ el : &quot; I don &apos;t want to enter a complete thing about history here , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world .
the poem which you relate to that later was added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty is . &quot;
Mill@@ er lies properly right , but as he formulated it himself , it is not really about history .
it is about the contemporary resonance on the ascending words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state does not only provide any old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : &quot; Your humble , your poor , / your oppressed masses , who longing for , free to breathe , / the el@@ usive waste of your rich coasts . &quot;
there was never a time when the &quot; miserable waste &quot; was better to see on our screens .
Mill@@ er was not committed in literary review - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Tru@@ mp@@ s USA .
this conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate : it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America .
Lazarus , and their friends , who sat down to place their words after their death on the basis - did very good that they are accomplished a highly political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American re@@ public@@ anism , representing the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn @-@ used classical image of freedom .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in its poem , the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and there is a very different name for themselves : mother of the ex@@ iles .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist cou@@ p and a devastating attack on the American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just like Lazarus the meaning of the statue changed , the people from the right wing wanted to change it for a long time .
the great cry of the rush of Rush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tru@@ mp , argued that the Statue of Liberty was nobody to load , but rather an early neo @-@ conservative , which bring the American flame into the re@@ marked world : &quot; Lady Liberty is moving ahead .
it is intended to carry the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tor@@ ch should not enligh@@ ten the way into the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
quite unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh here on something cris@@ p .
the meaning of the statue is entirely and certainly a question of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative deed of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen from the exhaustive , but hope@@ ful people after long and often terrible trips to the de@@ cks of ships was seen .
it is the tru@@ est sense to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
her statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear .
and that is of course not the perspective that Mill@@ er and Tru@@ mp will ever wish to recognize .
your tor@@ ch is not supposed to enligh@@ ten the path , but the hatred that is the only source of power .
world Championships 2017 : N@@ eil Black lo@@ oms Scottish members of the UK
E@@ ili@@ ie Do@@ yle reminds us of a time when only two vill@@ i belonged to the team of Great Britain .
the performance director of the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ in @-@ member cont@@ ingent of the world championship team will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which starts on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Scotland developed something special &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom has to learn something from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand and we will continue to figure it until we find it &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think that something has to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think that there is something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes , medals cont@@ enders , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - which will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5000 m circuit , while E@@ ili@@ ie Do@@ yle was elected by the team to the team captain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ ie is rather modest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
your captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish , or wherever they live or train , went out of space and felt very proud and were highly motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ ie has made quite natural , were great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Commonwealth @-@ Silver Medal , who will compete at the 400 @-@ m hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; unbelievable &quot; that 16 d@@ ots in the British team are .
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes on the World Championship were seven , which were achieved in 1983 and 2015 .
the Mittel@@ rah@@ edron Mu@@ ir leads on this path and has placed five British and two European records last year .
it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 metres of rounds .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , the 1,500 m running , is another Sch@@ otte , which one was looking for a great season , which went to win the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary Games .
Do@@ yle is remin@@ is@@ cent of their first world Championships as the only other Scot@@ sman in the team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ nell .
the captain &apos;s captain said that they are &quot; extremely proud &quot; on the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots do not only belong to the team but in some cases also with the medals and at the Fin@@ als .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the special thanks to the team captain , is that it was a great honour from the other members of the team , but knowing that my team @-@ mates voted for me and elected me , makes it something very special for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am very proud of all the car@@ rots who belong to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows only how far we came .
and they are here as established athletes , athletes , who want to climb to Po@@ dia .
what is concerned my speech as a captain ?
yes , I think she went well .
I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from it , that we are back in the stadium again .
I get a second chance to go there and compete and there will be just as a great atmosphere out there . &quot;
block critic@@ isms of Facebook : Be@@ wir@@ b does not share a public office if you cannot wear the he@@ aters of voters
the father of our land knew something from bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it didn &apos;t take long until the newspapers drove him because of everything , from interior politics up to its political principles .
he we@@ ed in criticism , safe .
but he has not brought his critics to silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for in 17@@ 83 Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of expression may be taken away - and , stupid , and mu@@ te we are led as sheep to slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that brings me to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan , who has to work to be more like Washington .
Ho@@ ker@@ chiefs have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties desp@@ ised him at the beginning of this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the head of the governor , left the law@@ suit as fri@@ vo@@ l , and the on @-@ line comment was full of a bac@@ kl@@ ash with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Na , and ? &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is only Facebook , &quot; they said many people .
but it is important .
and it is particularly important if there is a guy like ho@@ gan@@ ese .
this is a Republi@@ can Gover@@ nor in an overwhel@@ m@@ ingly democratic state that is ast@@ ounding .
he has the second @-@ ranking agreement of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
man@@ gan@@ ese is not a reactionary heat head .
he has shown a solid hand in the leadership of his state and strict compliance with principles .
he was also very sk@@ ill@@ ful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and to debate his ha@@ st@@ less head after chemotherapy on his side .
therefore the block@@ age of individuals coming to the side of the governor - which is a public forum , which is officially designated as officially and by employees , who are paid by public taxes - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post defended Ho@@ gans Ch@@ asse Ch@@ asse Ch@@ asse defended the actions of the Gover@@ nor and argued that the block@@ ages of the comments is nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to use the picture of tro@@ lls or sp@@ amm@@ ers or h@@ edge @-@ filled people who vibr@@ ate online the whi@@ p .
the Post spoke with some of the real people blocked by Ho@@ gan .
and these are just true people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , a business@@ man and a pastor , no tro@@ lls .
they all said that their comments were respectful , thoughtful and not prof@@ ane .
the pastor cited the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans Catholic faith .
Law@@ tin Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not h@@ edge filled , but they asked for hate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate and other current news , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote them in the commentary box of the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I also don &apos;t appreciate this idea if a number of people take on the same topic , then they are dis@@ regarded by some rather a so @-@ called collective action and not as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the employees of the governor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; others would probably call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inter@@ c@@ ession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fac@@ ebook era makes it easy to write a message by simply blocked a critic or deleted a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in earlier times when you have done the same that employees have been sent to gather newspapers with critical guidance and to burn or burn prot@@ esters and to silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this is exactly what is happening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ho@@ gan is not the first public official to critici@@ zed that he imp@@ lied Facebook and other social media .
President Tru@@ mp is prescribed by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter fe@@ eds .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question was last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of Lou@@ dou@@ n County passed the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to US District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when she named a voters from her Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky Gover@@ nor Matt Be@@ vin received a visit from AC@@ L@@ U because of its use of Facebook and Twitter .
it should not be so difficult .
in Washington time , Washington had a similar effect on the internet .
the number of newspapers multip@@ ly between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous stamp to his leadership .
and even at that time Washington had anonymous comfort .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the people who used pseud@@ onyms like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that Washington made making decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
peti@@ tions , which have critic@@ ised its position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , the trade and navigation of the United Kingdom , according to the historic documents collected from the George Pap@@ ers of George Washington Project .
but he has not brought them to silence .
freedom of speech , opinion and dis@@ courses belong to the basis of our nation .
and true leadership means to accept that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort at the Renaissance Club
the former Europeans No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope in the next three days on domestic comfort as the Renaissance Club in East Lo@@ th@@ ian organized the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , which led next year at the Ar@@ cher@@ field left until the end of the end , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is connected with the new out@@ law , and acts as a tournament message in the name of the association &apos;s founder and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built and we see how he reaches his fame with this event , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the players will see this course from his best , he is in a great condition .
Jerry did a great job than he laid this place .
he is a eager decay of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
the Engl@@ ish@@ man &apos;s English is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , though he won the European tour as well as the European Challenge tour in his 32 @-@ year career .
&quot; this really feels particularly , &quot; said the native player in South@@ port .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open as it was in the year after I won them out of the program . &quot; &quot; &quot;
back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories from the last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year here .
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate . &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50@@ th birthday , returns to the action at home .
this event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen asset management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh .
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this extra pressure .

less lung cancer by Pas@@ v@@ smoke
in the past two decades , fewer people have died because of passive cancer .
this result is the scientists of the University Hospital of Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( UK@@ E ) in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after our estim@@ ations per year 167 of lung cancer due to passive &quot; smoke &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Department of Hei@@ ko Be@@ cher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison he moved to this subject of 1994 .
back then there are still 400 lung cancer due to passive pas@@ v@@ rau@@ ds per year in Germany .
the new study is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
home@@ work prove to be very complex
the construction work in the Vill@@ inger Street are in full swing and &quot; lie somewhat in the time , &quot; says the leader of the Bau@@ x Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the area of household closures , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as in the underground much tri@@ ggers which is not noticed in the plans .
the traffic , which is repeatedly imp@@ eded the construction work , represents a big problem for the components of the company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ig@@ nor@@ ance of the mot@@ orists in front of red lights and lock@@ ers is already enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road is locked and only the buses are eligible for transit .
Angelo Car@@ uso , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z of the St@@ ump@@ p company has been busy with the works at the bridge for weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were very exhau@@ sting . &quot; &quot; &quot;

poverty and death in the Indonesian Gold@@ land
when Bar@@ dina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks , she uses no stove .
it even uses rarely a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of Pan@@ i@@ ai re@@ gent@@ a in the un@@ quiet ind@@ on@@ esian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife usually lays a sweet@@ est potato - locally as a &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace .
after half an hour , the shortened no@@ ol@@ le is taken with ei@@ ving , un@@ seas@@ oned hands and eng@@ ul@@ fed .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the arm@@ chair - she has no furniture - where she also carries her daily work , e.g. dres@@ ses with mur@@ ky water from the nearby sum@@ p to wash .
a bu@@ cket in a homeless space serves as a Lat@@ robe .
as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , you were not assigned any fields .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course , late can be dangerous : most vill@@ men are unemployed , and many drink heavily , and there are the soldiers here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody du@@ es it , after 5 p.m. in the village &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a rare insight into the daily life at the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , recorded in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 el@@ dest had to vote in before the occup@@ ying forces .
an existing movement that stir@@ red up for the independence against Dutch rule turned quickly against the government of Jakarta that includes control over the region and excl@@ u@@ des foreign journalists or legal monitoring .
in 2003 the province was officially divided in Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , with the independent part of Pap@@ ua New gu@@ ine@@ as part of the island &apos;s eastern part .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as secluded as it is desert . the journey includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the car .
there is no public transportation .
the town with approximately 19@@ ,000 inhabitants is made of wooden houses which are surrounded by bam@@ boo stran@@ ts , and from cor@@ ru@@ ding roofs , which were converted by r@@ ust into different yellow tones .
only very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their journey here , so@@ fter than journalists and practically no foreigners .
before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans a God called U@@ GA Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wear these clothes , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and pointed to her lively , hand@@ held web@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright rock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier we had only leaves on our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pap@@ ua is an im@@ pover@@ ished province , where 28 % of the people live under the poverty line and some of the worst inf@@ ant and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indon@@ esi@@ ens Gold@@ land .
the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , grass@@ lands , owned by Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high country Province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3.000 inhabitants .
in 2015 Free@@ port was built in the value of 3.@@ 1 billion US dollars and copper .
in addition , Pap@@ ua dispos@@ es of wood resources in the value of estimated 78 billion US dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , this wealth is a source of misery for the Pap@@ ua that make sure that Indonesian &apos;s powerful military is preserved . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port has paid local military units and units between 1998 and 2004 almost 20 million US dollars , including up to 150@@ ,000 US dollars to a single officer .
Pap@@ u@@ tian demands for greater autonomy threatening these golden tracks , and shall be treated .
according to activists , more than 500@@ ,000 Pap@@ ua have been killed and thousands have been en@@ du@@ ed since 1969 by the Indonesian military , tor@@ tured and det@@ ained .
mass@@ acres in Pap@@ uas Stamm@@ es@@ hoch@@ land in 1970 @-@ yrs have been committed to genocide in compliance with the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission .
alone in the region alone the Indonesian police last year more than 3.@@ 900 peaceful prot@@ esters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we value the Every@@ thing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in a report of the arch@@ dioc@@ ese Brisbane from the year 2016 , in which reports on atro@@ cities and torture - rape and electric stops are especially popular after another report - and the brutal precip@@ itation of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims as each week does happen , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia @-@ researcher for Human Rights Watch .
the screws are ampli@@ fied , because Pap@@ uas resources have a influ@@ x of settlers in other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province has been 83 % Christian but the demo@@ graphic development is changing , as Muslim econom@@ ist from the inhabited islands Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i come .
Jav@@ anese War@@ ung @-@ cant@@ ons sell bro@@ minated chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ ut@@ ches .
local people fight for staying here .
&quot; the migrants have begun to sell chickens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Pap@@ ua , &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year Pan@@ i@@ ai Local , who moved to the provincial capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has the native Pap@@ ua - the mother @-@ m@@ ama &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Pap@@ ua - her market &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indonesian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , in the masses , and as a Jok@@ ow@@ i , spoke to the inequalities and legal violations in Pap@@ ua in 2014 .
the former carp@@ enter 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential pal@@ ace@@ in Jakarta .
but in Pap@@ ua little changed , and today the locals feel che@@ ated .
&quot; our hearts have broken because we voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i , with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; says You .
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered a low point in October only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is inauguration in October .
on 7 December 2014 , a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , as two Indonesian soldiers on a motorcycle through the darkness .
the terri@@ fied children told them that they should turn their spot@@ lights .
one of the soldiers participated in her sound and later came back with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , ch@@ ased and smote the group with their tissues , they said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers threw in the group of children .
a child , the 16 @-@ year Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so hard be@@ aten that he fell into coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby government Commission was set on fire and the things escal@@ ate the next day .
about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered together on a football field in front of the local police station and the Military Commander center to request justice .
they carried out into the circle of hunting , and led the orph@@ an dance - in the circle continuously and a bird @-@ par@@ able - by pop@@ uas Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe .
some prot@@ esters began to tow stones at police and military post .
when the atmosphere was sanctified , the soldiers was sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses can afford more than three times , they shoot it dead , &quot; said it in an official document of TI@@ ME that has not been released to the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the dro@@ w@@ aking risk and called for rest and asked the amount to return home .
nobody was listening in the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , I suddenly shot in my lin@@ kes w@@ rists , &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the veranda of his colourful wooden house .
Kay@@ ame still does not know who has frozen , but says that the bul@@ let from among the ranks of the soldiers gathered together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was over@@ crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his cous@@ in , the witness of the shooting .
&quot; I ran to him and searched for his body to be sure that he was , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who bears such a name , the TI@@ ME in a mo@@ ster@@ er mood .
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kiss@@ ed him . &quot;
the editor @-@ spec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said Re@@ por@@ ters that his officers &quot; wanted to secure their station only &quot; they wanted to be attacked .
&quot; we must defend ourselves when men thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner Pud@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 .
&quot; it is life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many more viol@@ ates .
the news on the kill@@ ings arrived only on the following day &apos; fil@@ tered &apos; to Jakarta .
three weeks , Jok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate talk in Jay@@ ap@@ ura in which he vo@@ iced sympath@@ ies for the families of the victims and s@@ wor@@ e to address the historical ab@@ uses in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case immediately solved , so that in the future it will no longer happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
security Minister Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 , that he may set out an extra@@ judicial mechanism for establishing historical human rights violations .
but the interpre@@ ters began almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the injuries occurred a long time ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were in the 90 &apos;s and early 2000 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed to address these violations , but there are processes that need to go through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then , Wir@@ anto made a withdrawal when he said on 5 June in Jakarta with TI@@ ME and said he has no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Pap@@ ua .
instead , &quot; everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said .
Wir@@ anto , which has indi@@ cted the UN for &quot; crimes against humanity , &quot; said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Pap@@ ua had already been included , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims took such claims with gri@@ eving and unbeliev@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was inter@@ viewed in the last three years , but there was no progress &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear for years later .
&quot; I am afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am afraid of being arrested by the military , I was afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says that he was be@@ aten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I buried the corp@@ ses , the military sought to me , &quot; says he .
the shal@@ e have not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police on vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confrontation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma , who refused to bring a unconscious man to hospital , died one person and 17 others were wounded , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was dro@@ w@@ ned when he sto@@ cked in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
rising vill@@ agers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s location .
the police said that the vill@@ agers were sitting on officers , which re@@ acted upon it by dra@@ gged warning .
but locals tell that the mobile Brig@@ ade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot a lot and sle@@ w a sle@@ w .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be re@@ venge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year Dom@@ ing@@ gu B@@ adi@@ i who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the wounded were delivered quickly here , so the TI@@ ME .
&quot; I have hidden two days in my house . &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai parliament has called to call the officers to account and retreat the mobile Brig@@ ade of the police in the area .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a ru@@ gated board for the Indonesian government .
the lack of sensu@@ ous development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the tri@@ bal Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and Dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua .
many adher@@ ed to the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the re@@ bel army , which claims to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua by col@@ ouring sports attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indonesian soldiers .
some of the top @-@ O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya .
in response to thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai in recent years , thousands of people were arrested and w@@ aged in custody under the pretext of &quot; securing national sovereignty . &quot;
some would never dive again .
among the people in Pap@@ ua is Pan@@ i@@ ai , as a &quot; tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction .
the bit rice , which is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of reach .
the people here build everything they eat : especially Not@@ a and fruits and vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women , each of four or five fields of the Sweet potato .
they retain the majority of harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indonesian pe@@ ers ( 75 C@@ ents ) .
in the course of time economic inequalities between the native Pap@@ ua and the new migrants have grown , who since the opening of new flight routes to the airport Nab@@ ire arrived in larger numbers .
the few jobs there are in the region , usually go to the better educated and aff@@ lu@@ ent migrants .
Pap@@ ua rarely have capital or the necessary skills to lead their own business competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the Chief Council of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot; &quot; &quot;
isolation holds the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
furthermore , the restrictions of reporting international media remain tense .
at the beginning of the year , the French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ die and Basi@@ lle Long@@ cham@@ p were de@@ ported for lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although they were given rare permission for movies .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the Vice @-@ Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is campaigns , to raise the limitations of reporting to promote transparency and development , not realised .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new threats to foreign journalists who try to report from Indon@@ esi@@ ens un@@ quiet east@@ ern@@ most provinces of Pap@@ ua and West@@ papers : visa @-@ denial and a black list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely restricted to the immediate neighbour Pap@@ uas .
in March there were six paci@@ fic states - Ton@@ ga , Nau@@ m@@ u , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the mar@@ sh@@ all@@ ine and the Sal@@ om@@ onen @-@ Inseln - the UN Human Rights Council , to examine the &quot; different and widely spread injuries &quot; in Pap@@ ua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have historically considered the O@@ PM .
the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian designer Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ia N@@ asi@@ r pointed the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jakarta : &quot; in Indonesia is still a democratic system , and there is free media so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights violations . &quot;
people on site want more foreign governments to take note of this .
as an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of the human right @-@ ambass@@ ador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura visited their silence and oppressed him . &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also participates at the meeting , but anonymous .
Indonesia has another presidential election , but the Pap@@ ua say that they will probably not vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is engaged by people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai Sh@@ ins &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the Chief Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he wants that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai People knows that there is under the constant threat of a country &apos;s military military , is based in im@@ pover@@ ished gu@@ ardi@@ ans and health services .
Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai People , like other Pap@@ ua , her voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; guilt , &quot; he must pay back .
&quot; they do not need any money , they just want justice , &quot; he says .
despite the threats and intim@@ id@@ ation , families of Pan@@ i@@ ai Notes include the last symbolic act of Des@@ p@@ ite , the suffering of a sacrifice was buried on a site just against the police and the military station .
they know that they might never give justice to them , but at least they do not forget the perpetrators of their crimes .
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with spoken head .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; skyscrapers of Dubai for the second time
a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest living towers of the world in Dubai in its passage and win@@ ang hundreds of inhabitants , from the 3@@ 37 meter high , 79 @-@ storey building to flee .
it is the second fire that is taken in just two years by the high @-@ house that is called the Tor@@ ch @-@ Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) .
the building was evacu@@ ated , injury were no reported and there was no direct word on the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept with the fire alarm and the cry of the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran@@ ged the stairs down , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50@@ th floor , &quot; told a resident who had his name as George An@@ ab , Re@@ uters .
Dubai &apos;s civil protection authorities said that the units of fire fight against 4.@@ 00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 p.m. GMT ) the fire extingu@@ ished and the building was cooler .
the government said they work on the provision of accommodation for the persons concerned .
the incident can be used questions about the safety of materials that are used in outdoor areas of skyscrapers around the world .
an examination by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the largest portion of the damages caused by the cl@@ adding , the external cl@@ adding to decoration or insulation , came .
in Britain , the police , they believe that the system of plates for insulation and cl@@ adding on the London Gren@@ fell tower in June was the rapid spread of a bran@@ ding in June , where approximately 80 people died .
no Davis Cup reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the president of the International tennis association ( IT@@ F ) is at the general meeting with his great Davis Cup cou@@ p .
at the meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , the proposal for this sport revolutionary suggestion , Davis Cup single was still supported on two lines , Hau@@ ch@@ thin not supported by the required two @-@ third @-@ majority .
although often very long , but also therefore very valued five @-@ set @-@ classics stay the tradition @-@ rated so .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 per cent of the member states voted for the reform , the aim of the IT@@ F @-@ President David Hag@@ g@@ ty , was therefore only almost dis@@ missed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision , but we are disappointed that our members have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of this iconic and historic cont@@ ests , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ g@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one will continue to work to improve the assessment .
not until the vote was after the vote , the proposal had already taken place before the proposal , the finale in a neutral place .
new from 2018 are only compar@@ atively small details : so the fin@@ alists are in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will in future have the host right next round .
to reduce the costs of the organis@@ er , the requirements in training plac@@ ements etc. are easier and the players will have to complete with the Davis Cup less official media events .
more than 1 out of 5 US travelers puts the forbidden items into the plane , find out a survey
a survey conducted under flight @-@ fitting yiel@@ ded that over 20 percent become aware of or un@@ aware of forbidden items at the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent , who wor@@ ship@@ ed the plane while being acci@@ dentally promised kni@@ ves or other objects with blades .
less than 1 per cent asser@@ ted that they could have been bel@@ ated that they were travelling with s@@ uss@@ weapons , am@@ muni@@ tion or explo@@ sives .
the survey with more than 1.000 persons - provided by a jet charter service , Strat@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , performed - also stated that younger travellers more likely dis@@ regard the rules .
of the respon@@ dents that they were know@@ ingly tried to fly with something that was prohibited by the T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent Mill@@ enni@@ als , compared with less than 15 percent , members of the generation X were .
the most common items that have been inten@@ tionally rus@@ hed to T@@ SA agents , were foods and liquids .
more than 3 percent gave to , know@@ ingly have borne objects with blades by the safety control , whereas 2,@@ 2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.@@ 7 per cent of the male in@@ quired also confirmed that they had been inten@@ tionally brought the drugs into the plane .
the company said it worked out travellers throughout the country to find out how many acci@@ dentally s@@ mu@@ g@@ gel@@ ware had brought about by airport safety and how many it had inten@@ tionally done .
there is no surprise that the people , the most definitely s@@ mu@@ g@@ gel@@ ware - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - thanks to the safety , those who were most often flying .
however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are a bit complicated and confusing .
people are often uncertain about which liquids they may bring , or how much of it .
so it is no surprise that the largest amount of conf@@ is@@ cated items conf@@ is@@ cated by the T@@ SA .
a while we thought the T@@ SA could look at books as a s@@ mu@@ g@@ gel@@ ware .
liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k is not matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel orders
&quot; &quot; &quot; elec@@ tro @-@ trade fair El@@ on Mus@@ k gives a huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Model 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so far , he has to propose that a part of the client has already withdrawn its non @-@ binding reservation .
in addition to the always tri@@ umph@@ ant figures on sales growth and even more stag@@ gering finish , Tes@@ la @-@ Chef El@@ on Mus@@ k has revealed for the first time a different , less gl@@ oss number : the cancellation is used in the new mass market model 3 .
in the past few months Mus@@ k has been pre @-@ applied with more than 500@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car whose delivery was just starting .
now Mus@@ k is a : of the total 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders have already been withdrawn again 6@@ 3,000 .
critics always had pointed out that it is only a non @-@ binding reservations .
in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; reservation payment &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently , 45@@ ,000 such non @-@ binding reservations are available at a telephone conference with an@@ alysts at the moment .
that the cancellation of so far some twelve percent of all orders could become a problem , however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe .
its argument : the challenge of ambitious growth goals lies not in demand but on the production side .
in the last year Tes@@ la had delivered Tes@@ la 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
in 2018 it is to be used - all models assembled - 500@@ ,000 , 2020 a million .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k there are currently per day 1800 reservations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who today ordered a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Model 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; may at the earliest to be expected on the second half of 2018 with the delivery - if Tes@@ la manages to carry out his brand @-@ new , never in practice tested production roads without major inter@@ rup@@ tions with maximum extent of utilization . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
but if it comes to larger delays , then the un@@ binding of the reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la .
because then the company can not pass over the dis@@ satisfied customers in dro@@ ves .
EPA chef P@@ ru@@ itt draws itself back on account of the rules of Obama @-@ Era on reducing emissions .
one day after having been lam@@ ents received by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt took the head of the Environmental Protection Authority , his former decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era to reduce emissions smo@@ g caused by air pollution .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change , as his agency proved to be the needs of state environmental authorities towards re@@ acting faster than previous vulner@@ abilities .
he did not mention the law@@ suit , which was raised against its previous place in a Federal Criminal Court .
it is a deadline which ran out on 1 October for states to adhere to the standards of down @-@ earth o@@ zone .
P@@ ru@@ ff announced in June that he will delay compliance with a year to study his authority more time , to study the plan and to avoid &quot; hin@@ der in local decisions or to hin@@ der economic growth . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tru@@ mp &apos;s prosec@@ utor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma was a long time ago a reliable opponent of severe environmental protection regulations .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly pushed aside to block the regulations and delay the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels .
the sudden conversion of Wednesday is the most recent legal envelope for the P@@ ru@@ ction regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
the last month has a Federal Ministry of Education in Washington decided that the EPA has exceeded its authority than he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of Obama administration , the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce meth@@ an@@ le@@ cks , to delay .
in a post on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ ction suggested that his turn@@ around in o@@ zone standards is simply the willingness of EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely performance of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under former administr@@ ations , the EPA has often met the deadlines for execution and then waiting to set up by any activ@@ ist groups and others , and in an agreement to set the appointment for conducting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt who spent the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation by court proceedings , and we take deadlines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also accept the law and the authority it gives us serious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless the statement of the EPA approved that P@@ ru@@ ction eventually made its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; power to delay and all the others &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to make sure the rules &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on solid policy and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Re@@ public@@ ans in the Congress will push for a comprehensive collection of o@@ zone rules .
a bill adopted last month is to delay the implementation of the rules of 2015 at least eight years .
the measure was not yet made available in the Senate .
the New Yorker &apos;s general state @-@ attorney Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who ruled the coalition of the states that cr@@ ush@@ ed the EPA during that week , said the Group intended to maintain the legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conversion of EPA - after our pe@@ ers - is an important asset for the health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by smo@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new York closed in this case California , Connecticut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Maine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ia , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
ground @-@ Oz@@ on occurs when contam@@ in@@ ants from cars , power plants , oil plants and other sources in the atmosphere to sunlight react .
the smo@@ other smo@@ g can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people and contributing to thousands of premature deaths every year .
representative of the public health system and the environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered over P@@ ru@@ ge surprising change of course .
&quot; it is worrying how much pressure it takes to obtain this reasonable step by the responsible for the protection of air we inhal@@ e , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Diversity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue to fight against the ideological cr@@ us@@ ade of the Tru@@ mp government to ins@@ ulating environmental contam@@ in@@ ants and their special interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tum@@ ors celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the Berg@@ kirche is invited to the old cemetery @-@ real in tum@@ our on Sunday , 16 July , at 16.@@ 30 o &apos;clock to a Seren@@ ade .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village is the historical St. Hil@@ arius system a popular place to stay .
the visitors to the sixth ben@@ e@@ fi@@ z @-@ Seren@@ ade can be enchanted by this powerful place .
the preservation and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and promot@@ ers of tum@@ our to their concerns .
Walter Mart@@ ini stressed : &quot; it is a unique Christian Klein@@ od . &quot;
in the year 12@@ 67 , the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was mentioned for the first time in Württemberg : Graf Hermann von Sul@@ z has sold the mountain with the parish church of Tum@@ ble and the Vo@@ g@@ tei &quot; at Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver .
according to the wording of the certificate , standing on the tum@@ our mountain apart from the former parish church , also a magnificent courtyard , to which the church or the patron Church was quite and not the other way round .
so there were also people there .
as deri@@ ves from the description of the Upper Freu@@ den@@ stadt of 18@@ 58 , was next to the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which today are still visible in the village of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; Berg &quot; of the Third , of the glori@@ fication of the village .
old maps from the time around 1600 under@@ went this historical circumstances .
the pat@@ ron@@ ement law was created from the early medieval peculi@@ arities .
a Lord , who built a church , went out and occupied with a pastor , continued to be the owner of this church and could also inher@@ it this self @-@ church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus the right to use a pastor or to propose a new pastor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three alt@@ ars were there in the church and two bells on the tower .
the Greater of the two zer@@ mer@@ st at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell was then first recorded in 16@@ 92 , but had to be handed over to the Second World War in 1942 .
in the 30 @-@ year war ( 16@@ 16 until 16@@ 48 ) the windows have been captured and the bells are stolen .
the roof was imper@@ den@@ sely .
17@@ 96 built French troops in the vicinity of the church .
they removed the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
remains of the Church dro@@ ught in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery also served as the last resting @-@ place for the dead from Hör@@ schw@@ eiler .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was extended and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was cancelled .
only the cher@@ ries left .
in the New Year @-@ eight 18@@ 34 , a storm took the cher@@ ries and the half rus@@ hed .
in order to prevent an evil , the tower was cancelled .
only today still existing Tur@@ m@@ z@@ wer@@ g remained as a witness of the 750 years old church history .
today , Horst K@@ mos@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em from the &quot; Schaff@@ ner reti@@ ers &quot; as successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn the Hil@@ arius system .
as an organis@@ er invite friends and sponsors tumor on Sunday , 16 July , to the sixth Seren@@ ade at the old cemetery to the church of St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle .

the Seren@@ ade takes place only with dry weather .
the organis@@ er hope for many supporters to preserve the historic St. Hil@@ arius system , which is of importance for tum@@ our and listening .
the friends and promot@@ ers feel particularly committed to the home care , like Seren@@ ade @-@ organizer Walter Mart@@ ini .
association wants to test permission of windsurfing
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not see a legal prerequisite for the construction and therefore has turned towards the country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has prompted Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ es ( CD@@ U ) to take his permission for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is un@@ lawful .
the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 , the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette could not have had wind turbines to be approved , since at the time in four on the border to Schwal@@ m@@ tal , a wind force concentr@@ ations existed .
within this concentration area , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , at the same time causes the concentration @-@ zone but a exclusion of wind use for the rest of the city .
lead zones should prevent a &quot; saving &quot; of the landscape .
the town of Four@@ sen had had a few days earlier by a change of the floo@@ ding plan with a second wind @-@ fired concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette - which however had not approved the district government in Düsseldorf , because of a fault error .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planning @-@ legal condition , the permitted appro@@ vals is still un@@ lawful and therefore also res@@ ign , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ kens , Chairman of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of affairs : the city council once again decided during the summer break again the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette ; a permit of the District government is still standing out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; note : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus at this point the issu@@ ance of a permit for the construction of wind turbines are not excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the invitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letter has been received since last week in the circle of Four@@ sen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained a speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes them to the occasion to check the matter once again .
but they do not expect the procedure to be stopped .
with a view to ongoing procedures at the Board of Directors the circle on Thursday did not want to express itself in terms of the argum@@ entation of the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot;
the NEW Re , an affiliate of the NEW , is planning on an area on the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette construction of four per 200 meters high wheels .
already last year , the company had participated in which the city of quad@@ rant is involved , p@@ acht@@ agreements concluded with the owner of about 65 hectares of large terrain .
by building the four wind turbines , the electricity requirement of around 11 400 households can be covered - this corresponds to approximately one fifth of the power @-@ demand of all four @-@ decade households .
the NEW re will invest around 20 million euros .
in the last summer , four thousand City Council gave green light to purchase three wind turbines in the wind park Lin@@ ni@@ ch at Aachen , as well as a stake in a wind plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the circle Hein@@ sberg .
car and tractor cr@@ aps together : woman dies in a terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident has established itself on Friday morning at 10 am on L 333 between Nieder@@ s@@ las@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhine @-@ L@@ ahn circle ) .
a woman was in@@ ju@@ red in doing so .
two further persons were in@@ ju@@ red .
the provincial road was closed over hours .
after police information , a 17 @-@ year young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch went out Bor@@ ni@@ ch with their car in the context of accompanying driving with its 53 @-@ year mother as accompan@@ iment of the L 333 in the direction of Bo@@ gel .
city and traders plan &quot; home shopping &quot; -@@ weekend
bad Langen@@ sal@@ za@@ ar and people from the region are to re@@ discover shops in the city center in September .
the commercial association and the city administration want to use the weekend on 8th and 9th of September to attract the inhabitants of shopping st@@ rolling in the city center .
as the chairman of the business@@ man , Christian King , announced , the &quot; home @-@ shop &quot; -@@ weekend shall sensi@@ tise the customers that offers their own city aside from the usual supermarket product .
therefore , a market is planned with regional suppliers , similar to the weekly market .
in addition , local companies are to present with their apprentic@@ es@@ hips .
in addition , the shops of the city centre will be inviting to &quot; M@@ It@@ ter@@ night shopping . &quot;
the action is not only on residents of the city and the surrounding region .
in preparation be commerci@@ als in the radio , an internet video and printed bag that point to the Ak@@ tions weekend , so Christian King .
municipal office and commercial association collabor@@ ating with the Chamber of Commerce and Chamber of Commerce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the commercial association and the city go to another stage of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive downtown &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these include new offers such as the first &quot; Ak@@ tiv day &quot; to Brun@@ nen@@ fest together with commercial Sunday , talks with all business advertis@@ ers and hosts , to move them to active participation .
also attractive offers on Saturday and the reference to parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potential should be newly reconstructed or again .
these include cur@@ guests and tourists .
but also lots of indigenous people would have lost the city center when shopping from the view .
in the end , all of them need to contribute to in@@ vigor@@ ate the city center - up to landlords , the establishments of the whole city and associations .
it got to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network that has made some wider , had king in the spring .
Bir@@ git Stre@@ ich , Head of the I@@ HK @-@ Centers in Müh@@ l@@ hausen shared with that at the nationwide third &quot; home @-@ shop &quot; -@@ day , for the first time five in@@ gia cities participate .
besides Bad Langen@@ sal@@ za , this Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and B@@ lei@@ cher@@ da .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day sol@@ ves &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the appreciation of the local trade and to make its importance for the common good of our cities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Stre@@ ich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the promotion under the au@@ spices of the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners make it clear that each citizen can influence his direct environment itself .
two dead and one exp@@ ired after explosion at US School
during construction work there was a gas recovery in the school building .
new additional people have been in@@ ju@@ red .
in a gas explosion in the US @-@ city Minneapolis two people were killed and nine others have been wounded , some of them hard .
according to the fire fighting , on Wednesday ( local time ) was still a hur@@ t@@ ful in critical condition .
a man died , as a part of a school building in the explosion .
a first mis@@ ed was later also dead .
among the dead were the employees of the school .
as an un@@ fortunate thing suspected the public authorities work on a gas line .
at the holiday season only a few people stayed in the building of the Minne@@ ha@@ ha Academy .
Tru@@ mp , after sc@@ anned trans@@ cription of telephone calls Mexico under pressure due to payment of the border wall
trans@@ cription calls by phone call between US President Donald Tru@@ mp and leaders from Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on January 27th , Tru@@ mp was asked in a phon@@ o@@ at with the Mexican president En@@ rique Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to , to be publicly declar@@ ing that he would not pay for a planned border wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the U.S. President accused him because he denoun@@ ced the wall publicly . according to report he said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what you cannot say the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the USA and to let Mexico pay for the project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
trans@@ cription of his first approach to the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m gymn@@ as@@ ms were also published and un@@ attended an tense exchange .
Mr. Tru@@ mp said Mr. Turn@@ bull , that &apos;s a trade for the US refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia , &apos; mies &apos; and &apos; sil@@ ly &apos; and that the existence on the trade , which would not be convey@@ ed by the Government of Obama to look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; after he proposed a ban on res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees in the United States .
Mr. Tru@@ mp ended the call , after having said Mr Turn@@ bull , &quot; this is the most uncomfortable call for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ore Ford mass@@ acre : activists lead rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice again
a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mercury was driving through a group of spectators in rural Monroe , Georgia , and mp@@ ed on the Ford bridge of Mo@@ ore .
before the car , the four black passengers and a white driver had reached the bridge , a group wh@@ iter men entered in to block its path .
the guide of the mo@@ bs - a man middle aged man in a needle train - took a long train close to its cig@@ ar and looked like through the wind@@ shield .
in@@ doors the in@@ mates in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; br@@ ush@@ te the man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ l him out of the car ! &quot;
he is torn in the silence when a young black man was destroyed by the passenger .
fortunately this terrible scene , which was played on July 22 , is only a post@@ ural .
but if a loop is thrown by the neck from &quot; Roger , &quot; almost all of them in the audience were very real si@@ gh .
since 2005 Civil Bridge returns to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge in order to im@@ itate the night in the two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - from K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
nobody was ever charged with murder .
&quot; it is truly un@@ constitu@@ ent that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our communities , although we know who they are , &quot; said T@@ yr@@ one Broo@@ ks , who helps with the organization of im@@ position .
&quot; it is a dirt on a story but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year former Congress of Congress of Georgia and a life of citizens .
for him , the post@@ position serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual memory of the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want prosecution , we want to end , we want healing , we want healing , but first we must receive justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot get too healing and reconciliation until we get justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a bai@@ li@@ ff on the corp@@ se of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on 27 July 1946 .
according to F@@ BI acts , which were received by the N@@ BC News were susp@@ ects more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding locations in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process .
but no one was ever charged .
although the susp@@ ects have been on an open foot for decades , citizens say that double motivation for Lyn@@ ch &apos;s actions around the city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice made the black citizens in Georgia for the first time to vote in the pre @-@ election campaign in the summer .
approximately at the same time as the Ele@@ ction of the F@@ BI of the black Far@@ mp@@ ter Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a battle - supposedly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said that rum@@ ours was in the city was that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she carried away from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , 600 dollars to liber@@ ate Mal@@ com from prison , so the F@@ BI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her cous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey in prison .
but when she removed from prison to the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b took the car .
&quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison , who has been prepared and arranged the mur@@ ders , &quot; excl@@ u@@ des a F@@ BI report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a completion between the state and local prosecution , which was not only involved in the killing , proo@@ fre@@ ing proof and the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks formulated it still pre@@ gn@@ ant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an election mass@@ acre , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; if you register and when you vote then you will happen here . &quot;
almost a decade of C@@ ass@@ andra was directed the annual retro@@ position of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their presentation is vivid , po@@ ign@@ ant and is founded in a kind of deep racism , of which many believe that he no longer exists in America .
it is hard to watch and look more difficult , but Gre@@ ene said that that is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ x because we are then confronted with its ugly in all of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but I cannot establish a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have done . &quot;
the rehear@@ sals for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day , almost 30 actors - a dozen women and the rest bl@@ acks - into a room and lu@@ sion@@ ed , when Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ played overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Green@@ es Co @-@ director .
he has played the role of the boss @-@ member for many years , but he said the role will never be easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty , because I am not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but I think it is very important to get this story in life because we do not want to return to those times . &quot;
on the other side of the room rehear@@ sed the actors D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , the Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , their lines .
the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester and it oppressed him , angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said n --- he , mer@@ ges of my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ cona testi@@ fied the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone breaks ( at least all the black actors ) in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laugh at the lou@@ der .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; asked Ras@@ cona .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still wi@@ dening . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I simply don &apos;t believe that white people at that time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; n --- he &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but , &quot; wit@@ ching one of the other black performers .
&quot; you just need to make the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
and it is precisely that the energy re@@ moves in space , a feeling of compan@@ ion@@ ship replaces the discomfort .
everyone is busy doing this properly , not just because of the game but also because of memory of the four sol@@ dered people .
the scene again begins once .
this time , when Ras@@ cona said the N @-@ word , he says it sharp@@ ly and with a pressure .
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition is violent and fast .
there is more scre@@ ams , shots and then silence .
a woman , dressed with a sad@@ ness , stands above the corp@@ ses of the actors and introduces tri@@ l@@ ative Holidays &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
your voice breaks every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it , a group of about four dozen spectators get swe@@ at and tears from the eyes .
the audience is almost ev@@ enly between black and white .
a couple is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , travelled to see the performance , many come only the street down .
they have experienced all nearly eight hours of Geor@@ gi@@ as impressive moisture if Broo@@ ks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tomb of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point , the Mor@@ de has remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now when one stands on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch Mor@@ de came , the air feels sc@@ anned .
when the last notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ens loads the crowd to come closer and insp@@ ected the body &apos;s body .
children ho@@ cken on their heads , register the fake blood and breast@@ feeding body and whis@@ per@@ ing each other .
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; mur@@ mu@@ red a little boy , as if he wanted to remember it .
after a few minutes Gre@@ ens thanks a lot - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw the Lyn@@ chs@@ eil gone and wi@@ pe their tears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w um@@ ar@@ mt Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the move , who has played the C@@ lan@@ ster .
Nick Ras@@ cona embr@@ aces two of his fellow @-@ players and then breaks down in her arms , the emotional load of the performance eventually break with him .
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; whis@@ pers one of the women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that this is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you did it for a reason . &quot;
later the audience is put together with the actors for dinner together .
placed at a table a white pair from Atlanta prompted about the post@@ ure with a black pair which they just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski fought hard to find words which feeling the performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... from people to come as they look like yourself and which they do , because they look like you &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what really does with me leaves me to believe that Lyn@@ n still continues &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today the only police sli@@ ppers are called &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room T@@ yr@@ one Broo@@ ks dwelt at his table , he e@@ ats and reminded of the civil rights .
he said he already started to plan the performance in the next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the post@@ position is inspiring in some ways , because it describes the horror of what we have en@@ du@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is so if we can &apos;t learn anything from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whoever has not studied its own history , who doesn &apos;t know his own story is condemned to repeat them . &quot;

max Quanti@@ ty works as a volunteer
you work in several locations in their volunteer year .
where everywhere ?
quantity : usually at St@@ einf@@ urt in the furniture stock , once a week I can get here in Gre@@ ven at the furniture bridge here .
and I have already worked at the school in an open full day .
what are your experiences with it ?
quantity : it &apos;s a nice , wide spectrum I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
you are now 26 years , so a late volunteer volunteer .
how does that happen ?
quantity : I have made S@@ LC .
and then a civil engineering study , we say , successfully canc@@ eled .
I have recognised myself that it is wrong for me and I want to do something else with people .
and then I wondered what would you do .
do a social year as there is an insight , there you can see how it is on the spot , in the focal point perhaps also , really is .
and was it so ?
quantity : I have collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the winter semester .
I &apos;m going to study dual , probably at the Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne one social worker training and study at Ham@@ m at the Fach@@ hoch@@ schule .
is it not something unusual during the volunteer service to have several different areas of application ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it is probably always up to where you will be the FS@@ J .
you can make it from anti@@ sheim to youth work - in all possible fac@@ ets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the after@@ no@@ ons .
for me that was just the right thing that has ri@@ pped me .
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really is .
different from the civil engineering study ?
quantity : well , it is not about to reck@@ on st@@ ati@@ ks .
you always have a head over again , each of which have a completely different story behind .
whether a refugee , whether a teen@@ ager had been picked up out of the family - you have to always pay individually to it .
very interesting .
and you had no reservations ?
quantity : for this I am not the guy .
it is an area that gives a lot .
lots of love , lots of kindness .
there are also negative moments , but so is life just .
Pear@@ son k@@ ron@@ ded more 3,000 jobs and over@@ threw the dividend to rev@@ ital@@ ise the business
the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday , they will dismant@@ led further 3,000 jobs and cut off their intermediate space around 72 per cent as another restructuring programme will be started to overcome the pressure associated with the company .
the job construction , the Director @-@ General John Fall@@ on primarily announced for late 2018 and early 2019 , comes in addition to its previous restructuring , where already 4,000 positions were lost .
Pear@@ son announced in May in a third cost reduction program a plan for cost reduction in excess of 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) to res@@ ur@@ ate a business again , which was taken by the rapid step towards the digital learning .
the company that had expressed its involvement in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House at the Partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann , said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged , after the first half @-@ year , a growth of 1 percent rose to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds .
con@@ voy attack by Kab@@ ul : NATO @-@ Sol@@ dier killed at a su@@ icide attack
a su@@ icide attacks has attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afgh@@ an capital Kab@@ ul , a soldier of Nato killed and several others hurt , say officials .
five soldiers and an interpreter have been violated , shared a statement by Nato .
confirmed local reports have died with the incident in the district Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h as well as three civilians .
the bom@@ bing is the last violence in Afghanistan made this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed at a mosque in Her@@ at .
on Monday a su@@ icide was killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kab@@ ul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an opinion of Nato , it is alleged to happen the explosion at Thursday night when a common pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; killed explo@@ sives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement suggests that all the last in a stable state are to be treated in a stable state and treated in the US military hospital at the air@@ field of Bag@@ ram .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group , which is known as a so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , is a great concern for NATO troops in nearby Bag@@ ram .
according to the United Nations , in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 there were at least 1.@@ 6@@ 62 civilian deaths , of which around 20 % in the capital .
at the end of July , a su@@ icide @-@ mot@@ om@@ be killed at least 30 people in a mostly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul .
the Taliban said they had done this attack .
on May 31st , a tremendous bombar@@ d@@ ment in the centre of the city sle@@ w more than 150 people with the deadly milit@@ ant attack of the country , since the US @-@ guided troops in 2001 pushed the Taliban by the power .
the violence underlines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tru@@ mp is weak@@ ened , the number of US troops to support the military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that the su@@ icide attacks in Kab@@ ul has also caused a crisis of public trust in the government , their policies and especially in the reputation of President As@@ hr@@ af Gh@@ ani .
EPA moves decision to delay the smo@@ g rule to K@@ ats
the American environmental protection authority has a decision to delay a regulation of the government of Obama to delay the states that smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions to intru@@ de . this was a day after 15 Coun@@ tries the agency due to the stri@@ de def@@ endant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday to drive the decision called &quot; O@@ zone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2015 , and said they show the obligation of the Agency to cooperate with states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and in mind that we are responding to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA chef Scott P@@ ru@@ ff in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of EPA in June to set the o@@ zone regulations in which in a part of the country &apos;s poll@@ ut@@ ary emissions , to specify where inc@@ isions must be made to delay tigh@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year until October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , traveled on Tuesday law@@ suit and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tru@@ mp has tried to return a wide range of environmental conditions that has imposed on the former President Barack Obama , as part of a wider agenda , which should stimulate economic growth according to Tru@@ mp &apos;s economic growth .
however , efforts have triggered the rel@@ apse of Democrats and reserves that worry about the effects of greater emissions on public health .
the website of EPA says that the inhal@@ ation of air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; the lung function , and can enhance the respiratory symptoms , &quot; such as as@@ thma .
common aims at common Room
in the end the decision was clear : with two counterparts that decides the common pri@@ est@@ at of Flu@@ orn win@@ ches the establishment of a collaborative space in the future home population .
prior to the discussion there is an important information : the sale agreement for the remaining part of the property was signed , Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
although it still will take , until the so far the church community belonging to the community is owned , there is now no planning for the project from a private investor to st@@ em@@ ing project more .
there is a discussion concerning a common area .
one of the two investors , who are still in the boat , has offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - approximately 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with 70 square meters of space for a special price .
the administration and majority of the council does not float above , such a common room not only fores@@ ee the meeting place only for residents of sen@@ i@@ ren@@ al living , but open into the community .
as an example , the word from the &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; made the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision that has already been decided by providing funds for the ongoing household already last autumn by funding possibilities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the construction is in the refur@@ bish@@ ment area .
the establishment of a common space would be , so reported t@@ j@@ adas , with 60 percent of 30 percent eligible .
the proposal &apos;s proposal is to sign@@ aled to the investor that you don &apos;t want to throw him in this respect no k@@ not@@ ch between the legs , the finding that both saddle - what the height @-@ height is reduced and the construction of economic power - can be possible .
need@@ less , so does not mean only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer , be this addi@@ tive .
if it helps : unanim@@ ously he passes the body .
it is not that easy when it comes to the common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela &apos;s call refers to the many own buildings with which you can &apos;t move so much to make sure you are now at the common room out of the window , says it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do it hard with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ wi@@ t definitely speaks for the common room - but absolutely against a municipal participation .
it looks behind it a covered Sub@@ si@@ fication in any case @-@ like or at all foreign investors .
that is not so , because with the acquisition of the surface you do not give a grant , but I get a real , in doubt , in doubt , is the counter@@ part .
stadium request , the proposed classification , will find three supporters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so it remains with two counterparts in the original program that summar@@ izes Stefan H@@ aller so : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we put the decision so we make a huge step to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; it was last not good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increased performance in the first official end of the season . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team shows that qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play intelligent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; An@@ cel@@ ot@@ ti , who is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; difficult , intense game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

hiking in the Har@@ z of Star to Star
in Har@@ z the nationwide first &quot; star@@ pf@@ ad &quot; is supposed to arise .
this is planning the association observ@@ atory St. Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planetary route in Göttingen , since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star@@ ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes to the information of many hard@@ visitors , it was called &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he connectors nature , science , movement and sports performance .
members want to open tables along the planned route and inform about stars and star images .
in a first phase up to 2018 , the association is planning a well @-@ reachable installations to five to six locations &quot; Ober@@ har@@ z .
In@@ question Her@@ bal St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber .
the information on the boards should be added via the Internet .
therefore , the location of the site plays a good mobile network reception .
accessibility is a criterion .
later the star@@ ring train should be extended by train .
&quot; on the star@@ ring , the observer experience much of interesting facts , for example on the physics of the individual stars , &quot; explained the association .
in addition , they learned why stars would have different colors or why a star become stronger than another , even though it is far away .
also this constellation will find a selected star and when it is best to see .
the association has already operating the highest observ@@ atory in North Germany since 2014 .
the location in the centre of the Har@@ z National Park is one of the federal states for natural protection for the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
frequently from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a @-@ Galaxy can be clearly seen with naked eye .
in the Uni @-@ Stadt there has been a little simil@@ arity since 2003 on the initiative of the Förder@@ verein planet@@ arium Göttingen , something like the planned star@@ ch - the planetary path .
starting from Geb@@ har@@ ds Hotel in Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the Plan@@ etary leads up to H@@ ain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; extr@@ ater@@ restri@@ al &quot; site in Di@@ em@@ arden ( municipality of Sed@@ na ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the legs with the individual planets - including the d@@ warf @-@ planned degra@@ ded plug to the end point - are positioned exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ inking so on a sphere of 6,@@ 5 millimeters in diameter , while the sun sets exactly 70 meters from the sun at least 70 cen@@ timet@@ res .
the entire distance of the planet is about four kilometers .
while the light of sun is needed up to Plu@@ to for about eight hours , ped@@ estri@@ ans need a good hour until the stroke with Plu@@ to .
so ped@@ estri@@ ans are faster than the light in the cosmos .
the march to the next Fi@@ x@@ stern would still last a half year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down

&quot; &quot; &quot; when the couple for photos posi@@ tional , Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ m@@ ash that a possible show@@ down between fighters would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perfect size order &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am a former fe@@ ather @-@ weight , &quot; remembered Gar@@ cia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I rose up for bronze &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; but I am not so great . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to go down on body weight .
and he must move on loan weight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then fight .
that demand the fans .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko backed up .
&quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot;
clim@@ ates asked whether it must be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko had to agree with a 135 @-@ pounds debut in the next summer with Gar@@ cia a date ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also interest in the fight against the winners of Jor@@ ge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Campbell at their body @-@ weight campaign in the forum on September 23 .
&quot; this battle could take place in the pay @-@ per @-@ view mode because all fans have asked about him , &quot; said Gar@@ cia and expressed later open to fight with the network that offers the best financial package .
we are the best .
no other names can produce this kind of attention .

both said they could feel the Mom@@ entum in which he built up for his own fight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the battle that needs to be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other fight creates so much attention and excitement .
I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; said Gar@@ cia .
Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko said , &quot; I have been waiting for the top @-@ fighter , and that is Mi@@ key .
it will be a great battle . &quot;
four wounded according to tire plat@@ zer
in an accident on the A7 on Thursday afternoon four people were badly in@@ ju@@ red .
after the first information , the driver lost an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira at 16.@@ 30 o &apos;clock in front of the connecting market broad probably after a tyre plat@@ ter the control over his vehicle .
the car tow@@ ed to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he sur@@ pl@@ ated and then lie on the roof in the green stri@@ ps .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were heavily wounded in the accident .

Fort@@ unas Hoffmann : &quot; Tri@@ erk@@ ette works better &quot;
Andre Hoffmann hopes for 2 : 2 to the season opening up against Braunschweig that expresses the optimization of def@@ enses in Au@@ e points .
with the first season of the end , Andre Hoffmann was pleased with the result , as not the two oppos@@ ites would have been at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two oppos@@ ore too much and we must fit even better in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the defensive player from Fortuna Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains , the tri@@ bun@@ es should also be optimized further .
and a gate after a ban , the Fort@@ ress are no longer interested .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future it will be like no more to Michael ( R@@ ensing ) to the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will get better right after the experience in the preparation with the tri@@ pp@@ ets , than with the four @-@ qu@@ artet .
&quot; yet I don &apos;t know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his Trainer Fried@@ helmet , but Hoffmann is for his cause certainly because we have just been in the triple @-@ positions at KA@@ AN Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko G@@ ie@@ ß@@ mann Players who can build good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; condition is , however , that we are even better to harmon@@ ize ourselves and we do not afford so many ab@@ man@@ sions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , Hoffmann travels to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if one decided to speak with an accident of a mis@@ sive start , he does not know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the performance could indeed be quite okay , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we can concentrate on Sunday with four points and concentrate on the podium , we will certainly be able to speak of a proper seasonal season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of them his trainer wanted nothing to know .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the start into the season took place only after six to eight days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fried@@ r Funk@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; who did not want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e , just because the game of the Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim pre@@ matur@@ ely had to be cancelled due to a we@@ ather@@ case . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start the season practically with a home play , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; told Funk@@ el and Hoffmann that the player from Au@@ e may be even a bit of fresh , since they had no heavy and complete game like Fortuna against a ascension of their bones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but they don &apos;t know so 100 @-@ % where they currently stand , &quot; says the interior of the Fortuna .
the guests from the Rhein@@ land go as a lighter favorite on Sunday for meeting in finally ( almost ) completed stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we take away it , just because we have the claim to come among the first six , is bull@@ sh@@ it , &quot; says Funk@@ y , whose balance sheet is quite positive with only a defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team in the 2nd division that you must hit &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explains Fort@@ unas Princip@@ coach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to make such a statement would be arro@@ gant and arro@@ gant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so , Funk@@ el will not experience his players on Sunday .
new results of the Swedish asylum application tests published
the recent findings of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden who have subjected to a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that over 80 percent of people tested over 18 years are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish authority for for@@ en@@ sic medicine ( council problem ) has started performing the tests last year .
they should be more precise during the asylum procedure , after the Swedish migration authority ( migration cuts ) for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees critic@@ ised the min@@ der@@ age .
until now , migration has been sent to test cases 6.@@ 8@@ 80 to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results from a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid March to 31 July 2017 .
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were evaluated as 18 or older while in other 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency assessed that the person &apos; was 18 years or older .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may be under the age of 18 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tests are conducted only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson , by the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are consistently resistant in recent months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t see a big difference in the statistics of the past months , the figures are fairly consistent &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said the magazine The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases in which the person was assessed as over 18 years , does not necessarily mean that the asylum seekers has fallen over his age .
in May , the Agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases to suggest that the under@@ sought person 18 years or older . &quot;
when the newspaper S@@ ven@@ ska D@@ ag@@ bla@@ det predicted the 5@@ 81 results , set it firm that in 243 these cases the person had openly told they will become 18 years old .
the method of medical age assessment , in case of x @-@ rays of white @-@ teeth and resonance shots of knee joints , which are then analyzed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , was also critic@@ ised in some areas .
a scep@@ tics is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ inska Institute , whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of people to see if they went earlier or later as usual through pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t believe that the type of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
assessing the biological age in this way is very uncertain .
if we cannot say it safely , we should not do so as if we could , &quot; he said the newspaper Metro .
Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk to judge a child as an adult is un@@ correct .
the greatest risk is when the person is under 18 in this case , this is roughly 10 percent . &quot;
fully in the plan
the work on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
on Wednesday , there was seven tonnes of emphasis on the bridge at the eastern outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; we are very well in the time , it works great , &quot; says Rein@@ hold L@@ ens , building manager at the Department of road and transport in the Govern@@ mental Freiburg .
in April the work began simultaneously on all three sanitary bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .

Af@@ for@@ age in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ under protest in German potato salad
it does not happen so often that parties are moving along a rope but when it comes to an alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) comes together , what else is difficult to bring under a hat .
the parties in the chal@@ k @-@ day of the volcan@@ os representatives ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , left ) belong to a broad alliance that shows on this day peaceful flag because the Af@@ for@@ ks in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle Ron@@ dell are invited to the &quot; big electoral campaign . &quot;
and known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land became the leading directors for the Bundestag &apos; election on 24 September , and the Vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are on the spot hours before the start of the event don &apos;t want to listen to the Af@@ for@@ ers , but will demonstrate .
the motto &quot; The Ei@@ fel remains colorful . &quot;
originally the town @-@ picnic was planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; on the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but will now take place on the parking lot below the Ron@@ d@@ ell - and right in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ for@@ ge event in the Stadthalle .

&quot; &quot; &quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chair of the forum One World and one of the author@@ itative organis@@ ers , is really pleased : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great how many people came together here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are music and lots of food , including a &quot; ur@@ anic potato sal@@ at , which could also eat the Af@@ D without problems , &quot; says the woman who brought him away .

how did the Af@@ ters did actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ esh@@ y from the Af@@ D volcanoes , he has tried to make such an event and get the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had first ro@@ de in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already opened Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ ch did not exist enough parking .
so the Ro@@ un@@ del , Hom@@ esh@@ pes is happy that &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with a view of the event on the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ platz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of people , main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is also doing : against 20 o &apos;clock , on the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ platz offers a band for entertainment , located in the Stadthalle diverse speakers , including the rh@@ et@@ land @-@ pf@@ alz Mand@@ y @-@ chair Uwe boy .
in the hall there are about 200 people who are waiting for the top @-@ kan@@ gar@@ ment for the Bundestag &apos; election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the Vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix rix from Stor@@ ch to keep her speeches .
unchanged is the police presence , but so far the officials had a quiet evening .

tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
a re @-@ hearing with the Wolf@@ atter si@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli there are in the series of Has@@ l@@ acher Kloster@@ concerts tomorrow , Sunday , at 20 o &apos;clock in the convent church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the Bulgarian trumpet Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or even &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bal@@ kan@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meets a classical German training with roots in wind music . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both sol@@ o@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have se@@ opo@@ si@@ tions in European top orchestra .
so Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter at the prestigious Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is Sol@@ op@@ os@@ aun@@ ist of SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
both united the desire not only to cross the boundaries of their instruments , but also to merge the limits of the different gen@@ res .
this sounds Johann Sebastian Bach at the two as in a new gu@@ ise , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ man &apos;s world music &quot; united with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the J@@ az@@ ze@@ ch@@ op@@ tom@@ atic Classi@@ cal , Jazz and the free games to a fascinating general artwork .
this core of the program was only performed this spring with a little success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils Wo@@ gram has written it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ l@@ acher Kloster@@ kirche with her special acousti@@ cs will be aware of the concert included .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about her bis@@ exual
&quot; some people love gri@@ lled cheese and will eat him until the end of their lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart quite openly about her bis@@ exual . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; when I got stuck in gri@@ lled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what comes as next ? &apos; .
the probably most well @-@ known relationship of Horn@@ í stars was the one of her &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; colleagues Robert Patt@@ inson .
despite all this ass@@ ures the brunette with the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was seriously fallen in love with whom I have posted .
or do you believe it , I could have played it ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after their separation , Kri@@ sten announced that they bis@@ exual , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have always lived du@@ alism and believed in it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so it has never been confused or hin@@ dered me .
I just liked it to be taken seriously . &quot;
particularly below I suffered it according to &quot; Bang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; but in school time , when she rather dressed like a bu@@ b : &quot; not all girls are typical girls .
it really has been very ju@@ red .
when I was eleven I said the children , I would look like a bug .
I felt really attacked , frigh@@ tened and ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; girls , be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the public they did not like to live their love @-@ life : &quot; people expect that you are in a certain way , and that anno@@ yed me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some call me considered und@@ es@@ irable , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself from all over the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Gover@@ nor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the democratic Gover@@ nor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday night at a manifestation with President Tru@@ mp that he will change the party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether you like it or not , the Democrats have been removed from me , &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice .
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of thought ... today I will tell you as inhabitants of West Virginia , I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the r@@ ally broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Re@@ public@@ ans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Justice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as a trainer I would say it is time to play a different game . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp spoke a major announcement at West Virginia Rall@@ ye .
Mr. Tru@@ mp won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice approved not the democratic nom@@ inee Hill@@ ary Clinton .
Justice , which is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state was elected 2016 .
For@@ bes shows that he has carbon coal in five states and have inherited a carbon shop by his father .
it is approximately 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee on Thursday evening gave an explanation in which it said : &quot; the Party Change of Govern@@ ors Justice is another blow for a democr@@ ati@@ cal party that would rather than work to make our country great . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with only 15 govern@@ ors and the control of the least legislative bodies in history is the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice only the last rejection of a party which is from above to below without leadership and unable to find a positive , influential message , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the R@@ NC @-@ chairman R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation by the CB@@ S News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e lo@@ aves &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian excuse for doping sc@@ andal
the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia to an intelligence sc@@ andal , but he repeated , unless the moment for the country to be taken back into sport .

&quot; &quot; &quot; he said it was sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes , who were bor@@ rowed from competitions Gold@@ - and silver medals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments the IA@@ AF Congress held responsible for the maintenance of the ban , which was app@@ ended in November 2015 after a report by the World @-@ Anti @-@ Doping Agency ( W@@ ada ) information in Russia had found .
&quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF @-@ President Co@@ e the re@@ por@@ ters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire Council and the entire Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation experienced in itself that she has experienced some hot times and will do everything possible to make sure that the Federation will be re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Co@@ e said he is also &quot; pleased that Russia accept the criteria for his re @-@ introduction .
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress has been achieved , but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to use Russia , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the principle of principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the dep@@ ra@@ ved system , &quot; he added
nin@@ et@@ een Russian athletes are starting at the athle@@ tics world Championship , which begin on Friday in London according to the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral actors .
the director of the IA@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia still had to fulfil some of the criteria for re@@ setting .
drug tests are still inadequate and forbidden trainers are still active , he said Re@@ por@@ ters in London after a talk at IA@@ AF Council .

Prime Minister W@@ eil wants a swift re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
low @-@ depth Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) is after the loss of red @-@ green ruling majority for a swift re @-@ election of the day @-@ day , but does not want to res@@ ign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because it was on Friday for the resolution of the Parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously , the surprising withdrawal of a Green Members from its provincial government in Lower Saxony has over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) in a heavy crisis .
five months before the official date of the country &apos;s elections , the red @-@ green coalition in Hannover lost its scar@@ ce A @-@ vote majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the previous green @-@ MP El@@ ke T@@ ops founded their step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for election 2018 in its election circle in Rot@@ enburg ( des@@ erts ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see my political future at the CD@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they explained on Friday in Hanover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
CD@@ U Fra@@ gan@@ ce B@@ jör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend to his faction to take them up .
thus , CD@@ U and F@@ DP would have played 69 seats in the lower Sax@@ on Parliament , SPD and Green 68 seats .
so far the relationship has been revers@@ ed .
the new Land@@ tag will be re @-@ elected in the 14th January of the year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said the red @-@ green government must now decide whether they would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rule &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this situation without a majority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan W@@ eil has however , however , is indispensable for the fact that the Land@@ tag opens as quickly his self @-@ redemption as quickly as possible .
the CD@@ U faction is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
the provincial version also sees the possibility that the Land@@ tag gives the Prime Minister its confidence and cho@@ oses a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution provides several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these opportunities must be legally tested and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will discuss all questions in peace if they are legally reasonable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something short &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the policy @-@ author herself said : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
it was referred to as a seat in black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens demanded the tr@@ end@@ ous MP to return their country &apos;s day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say that she has received her country &apos;s Day , which she has received over the green of the country , shared with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shared the state @-@ called meta Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Group Leader of the Green An@@ ja P@@ iel said : &quot; we de@@ pl@@ ore the decision from El@@ ke T@@ alle . &quot;
they have decided not to conduct any pron@@ unci@@ ation in the group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even in the background that there was no sub@@ stan@@ tive dis@@ agreements , we cannot re@@ model this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

he support the decision of Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) to re @-@ elect the Land@@ tag quickly .
the exit T@@ west@@ ens costs red @-@ green in Nieder@@ s@@ achsen the majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the policy advis@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in their final van@@ ity and in their frustration , their personal interests before the welfare of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critic@@ ised SPD Secretary General of Hu@@ ber@@ tus salvation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony makes this dirty In@@ tri@@ gen@@ spiel and tries to strike it political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Federal Minister of Agriculture in the interview - How do we protect ourselves against gyp@@ sies , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany discusses about contaminated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves .
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is available in an interview with the editorial network Deutschland ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
Mr Schmidt , How can the consumer protect against poison@@ ed eggs ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can only encourage all consumer consumers and consumers to accurately watch eggs in your fridge and check the stamp @-@ print . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de the federal states reflect the latest information about the affected egg @-@ bat@@ ches .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if after all we currently know , a health haz@@ ard is virtually excluded .
is now Al@@ di the best crisis reaction - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the clari@@ fier of the Federal Minister of Agriculture is not really perceived ?
the food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , my house has immediately turned up immediately and has been since announcement of the subject of Germany in close exchange with the authorities of the countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
trade has just as the manufacturer to ensure that the sold @-@ sold products are competitive and health @-@ safe .
if in eggs the highest @-@ level content of 0.@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded , these are not refundable .
un@@ loaded eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time not the companies are to blame .
are production companies and consumers in the same boat ?
after a high level of knowledge , the production facilities meets no immediate guilt .
on the contrary , they must count due to mut@@ u@@ ct@@ ory practices of service enterprises with economic damage .
as always there is in the harvest of little check@@ ers .
is it only lacking in the staff or at the concl@@ usive jurisdiction ?
but there were just the official controls revealed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the truth is also that food fraud and criminal energy cannot be eliminated with 100 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is precisely because of this , a consistent explanation of such acts and the hand@@ over to the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in the cases where crimes are available . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already clearly stated several times that I expect a complete learning from the competent authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is the regular alarm system in food sc@@ and@@ als really necessary ?
consumers and consumers have the right to get exclusively safe and safe food .
if a non @-@ term insec@@ ti@@ cide use in the food industry , consumers and consumers are rightly indi@@ gn@@ ant .
by the bre@@ ased resources , manufacturers , traders and consumers get into a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
basically it must be clear : the illegal use of insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ c@@ il in the attitude of food supply animals is unacceptable and must be completed immediately .
it must be used consistently at all levels and with high pressure on all levels .
I expect from all the competent authorities , that the atomic facts will be challenged and complete .
how the financial principles of the football matches on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Mov@@ ing to Paris
the rules that aim to prevent un@@ hin@@ dered issues of the European foot@@ ball@@ ers , will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s World Record Transfer from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain .
any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Germain from the UEF@@ A still , as the executive organization that monitors the European game has the power , teams of access to the pres@@ ch@@ able Champions League tournament .
financial Fair Play rules , which were launched by UEF@@ A UEF@@ A , mean that PS@@ G has to follow , that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without major losses .
Barcelona has paid 222 millions of Euro ( 2@@ 62 million dollars ) to buy the Brazi@@ li@@ ans from his contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar is received a sal@@ ary that will amount to several ten million dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Mov@@ ing to France .
PS@@ G can make sure the money lock@@ ers , so N@@ ey@@ mar under@@ writes and bring it into a galaxy of other stars , given the funding of the team by the energy rich re@@ fr@@ active family of Qatar .
associations may apply a lot of money for the purchase of players , but have to control them with legitimate revenue streams , which allow them to obtain the break even point in their on the football .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election on UEF@@ A president in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs , who in their quest for success had enormous debt to themselves , effectively che@@ at and ris@@ king to ruin , when banks or owners moved their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from the concentration to the debts of the clubs to monitor their losses .
the change meant that the business model , the novel A@@ br@@ amo@@ vich was originally used in Chelsea - a club with potential and then strongly invested to improve the crew and build a global brand - to become a tough@@ er matter .
during the current three @-@ year @-@ year @-@ year period , which is running up to 2018 , clubs can take losses in the amount of € 30 million .
and although Plat@@ ini 2015 has fallen from the presidency in Un@@ gn@@ ade , his UEF@@ A successor to Ale@@ ks@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ a continues to det@@ ach them from excessive issues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surely FF@@ P is not dead and we will reinforce the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for FF@@ P from UEF@@ A &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compared to The Associ@@ ated Press during the past week . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out @-@ clause by N@@ ey@@ mar in a package , it can distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of its contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a 5 @-@ year contract , leaving the limit for the next five years to the amount of 4@@ 4.4 million euros in the annual financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has hit the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a reduction of 60 million euros ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which later was reduced to EUR 20 million - and it was arranged that the team members are eligible for the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players remains limited .
the UEF@@ A is looking for clubs which might try to over@@ see their financial insight by joining their earnings by companies that are associated with the owners of a club .
while a Catalan company could not use the PS@@ G , if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not be considered as legitimate income .
exactly this happened in 2014 , when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of sponsorship of the P@@ SA was blow@@ n from the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that a part of PS@@ G @-@ payments to N@@ ey@@ mar over payments by the Organ@@ izing Committee of the World Championship in Qatar could be obtained in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have denied that N@@ ey@@ mar World Ambassador will become and such a man@@ oeu@@ vre for the UEF@@ A regul@@ ators can simply be out of figure out .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEF@@ A will still be more attentive , every attempt to bear in mind the rules .
the UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G via N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , sag@@ itt@@ ling on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they spoke under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , since they were not authorized to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the last published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 have achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros in sales of EUR 5@@ 4@@ 2.@@ 4 million .
the accounts for the last financial year have to be published .
PS@@ G expects that N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrived a blessing for sponsorship De@@ als , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ ot@@ ting .
the association assumes that sales after the signing is at least 30 percent .
the Spanish League was clearly mist@@ aken , one of the best football players to see , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s departure , by claiming that PS@@ G would violate the FF@@ P .
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial intelligence &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the President of the La League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Kat@@ ars of the local ownership of PS@@ G .
ar@@ senal Manager Ar@@ sen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose society is owned by an American Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservation of La League against a State , which is financed by an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the owners and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association all is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult to respect the financial Fair@@ play because you can have different ways or have different interests when a country has such a great player to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss Life is looking for a new shock supplier
in recent years Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y chocolate has produced for Swiss Life in the past years .
now the good cooperation is close to a possible end : the airline lists the order new .
Swiss @-@ speaker at Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rot@@ t confirmed upon request of the news agency since a corresponding report of the newspaper &quot; North @-@ West Switzerland &quot; of Friday .
according to current planning , the airline will start a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products would be reviewed every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y we are very satisfied , &quot; said the speaker .
approximately 17 million small cherry @-@ packaged shock absor@@ bs to 14 grams per year the companion before landing to passengers .
the Swiss did not want to make any information about the costs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; industry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; industry of industry value the order volume in accordance with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; North @-@ West Switzerland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of approximately one billion Swiss francs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but more importantly it is the adver@@ t effect : for a shock manufacturer it is a pres@@ ti@@ zed job .
how many applicants are in the new tender , which does not want to betra@@ y the Swiss .
but there are only Swiss manufacturers .
according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make a renewal of the contract over the spring 2018 .
for the s@@ da , the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer is not accessible for an opinion .
chocolate panels spread the Swiss since 2006 on board their flights .
before Swiss a contract concluded with the Mig@@ ros daughter , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut had supplied with Hu@@ g the chocolate tablets .
the opportunity to place the logo , led Swiss two and a half years with the start of the collaboration with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline works with different Swiss cho@@ col@@ ates producers .
on long@@ standing flights , customers of the First Class with goo@@ dies are pampered by the Con@@ fis@@ erie jumps , in Business Class Nas@@ chen passengers Scho@@ gg@@ i from Lind@@ t and in Economy Class Scho@@ gg@@ i by Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .

nostal@@ gia goes into &apos; W@@ et Hot American Summer &apos; and &apos; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
this repetition of history is at the same time nostal@@ gi@@ cally because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 @-@ year @-@ era , for the 90 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ age @-@ era ( as the Pr@@ etch David W@@ ain and Michael Sho@@ vels the Sk@@ etch Com@@ edy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV , and for itself - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , such as Elizabeth Banks , Amy Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Rud@@ d went to bigger things .
as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and an em@@ bodi@@ ment of our fac@@ et era permanent memories .
but as franchise feels like the time would be short .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; worked surprisingly well , not only because of its leading Hum@@ ors ( it contained an original story for a promising vegetables that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .
by getting off at the core of the g@@ ags - actors middle aged man play , children , who are grown , they still manage to gain the im@@ possibility to reg@@ ain the final part of the wid@@ get .
&quot; ten years ago , &quot; with its adults , who now play adults , is less emotional @-@ rooted and its par@@ o@@ dy goes more after the found@@ ry principle , including a reef on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 @-@ er years like &quot; The Hand of Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le &quot; ( &quot; The hand that looks the cradle &quot; ) .
at a point of time a character through an Apple @-@ Power@@ book , several in@@ line sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from the year 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the ami@@ able C@@ oop ( Mr. Sho@@ vels ) , now romance ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ e@@ au ) has not yet forgotten .
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has still not lost its vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is still another crazy vi@@ cious P@@ lot , included in the Ronald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Sho@@ e ) , which is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well received impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always the expor@@ ters are the best part of the franchise .
it is especially good fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rud@@ d , who shows Matt D@@ illons under@@ beard from &quot; singles , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old cris@@ p .
it is the moments of random ins@@ anity that could turn this franchise as a kind of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until he reaches what I see as its logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : T@@ w@@ enty years , how she will visit the film premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon is now reminded of a different kind of nostal@@ gia : to the revival of the Cold War by &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even an &quot; G@@ low &quot; with its East @-@ fighting @-@ West ring @-@ icon@@ ography .
the com@@ edy by Brian Gat@@ ewood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka is created to be a found TV show : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Bucharest , who fight for truth , a@@ the@@ ism and the way of Marxism .
the main dri@@ ll@@ ings - a hard @-@ hard Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i whose di@@ alogs from Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also an exec@@ utable producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt will be synchronized in English .
it is an in@@ geni@@ ous idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice G@@ ags for watching ( the police spend time to watch chess on television as Americans perhaps do with football ) .
and the list of famous speakers - including Jenny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ ers@@ li@@ a Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ go@@ ose Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - ensures a decent game &quot; Fin@@ de the voice out &apos; .
but &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; is very committed to the true propag@@ ation of a dou@@ bt@@ ful propaganda dram@@ as - a k@@ iller that carries a Re@@ agan mask is involved - that it is often as a single one .
at six long episodes there is then , and the com@@ edy is not fast or frequently enough .
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective , &quot; which was re@@ acted to a lower length , his Ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p @-@ S@@ ati@@ re could deliver better , since Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef always visit the American message whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ mer@@ ges .
the message for the imag@@ ery communist audience is that Western culture can do everything to feed for a v@@ age .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian creators did not complain wrong : we even make it with our own younger history and with theirs .
blow against drugs @-@ ma@@ fia in the country
the police has been a blow against the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on the Mit@@ tw@@ ave tomorrow became in the Black Forest Ba@@ ar circle , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Con@@ stance , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , many objects have been searching through , such as the Pro@@ sec@@ utor &apos;s Con@@ stance on Friday .
15 accus@@ ations were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 , and had already arrested some arrest warran@@ t against these crimes .
in addition , the officials put greater quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , guns and several hundreds of thousands of euros .
in the simultaneous swe@@ eps of Italy two persons were arrested .
against the two susp@@ ects Italians there were German arrest warran@@ t .
the two will probably be delivered to Germany .
at the action were Italian and Bay@@ erische investig@@ ators involved .
in total , more than 300 polic@@ emen were in use .
the members of the Maf@@ ia will be accused of drugs , heavy violence , tried murder as well as rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mailing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already since summer 2016 the Pro@@ secution , the Pro@@ stance Con@@ stance against the organised drug trading in the South German space . &quot; &quot; &quot;
between the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Con@@ stance and Palermo there was a lively exchange and investig@@ ator of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore , the big work was accompanied by four officials from Palermo .
in the sight of studies backward , especially Italian nation@@ als with regard to the Italian ma@@ fia .
even an incident took place on 27 May in Hü@@ fingen as early in the morning , several shots were fired in a restaurant , would be likely to go to the bank account .
fashion lam@@ ents big gaps in the foreig@@ ner @-@ register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data of citizens that should not arise : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a report , the foreigners @-@ register in Germany has significant shortcomings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the lead to partly gra@@ vi@@ ating mis@@ decisions in asylum procedure .
the representative for the refugee management of the federal government , Frank @-@ Jürgen , has made aware of a media report according to major gaps in the country @-@ country register .
&quot; &quot; &quot; lack of data recorded there could lead in asylum procedures and de@@ port@@ ations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to some serious mis@@ decisions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warned that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the register are estimated that ten million people are gathered with foreign nationality , including about 5,@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data is therefore managed by about 600 foreigners in Germany .
because the data were not sufficiently well maintained , the data quality in parts so far has not been good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in individual cases , data from 1921 has been found &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by people who have long been no longer in life , or by citizens who have become German citizens and actually no longer appear in the register . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; faul@@ ty data allow@@ ances can significantly slow reverse processes considerably , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says the report to further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in statistics of emig@@ rate people , people are covered by EU citizens who would not have to travel at all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but such false statements led to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to a distor@@ ted debate on dealing with emig@@ rants &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said it is therefore in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the German government has apparently begun to return refugee families with 16 @-@ year children back to Italy if they arrived from there .
this emerged from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ ro@@ cker Newspaper . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the paper , the BA@@ MF lead such procedures &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerning families with children - except inf@@ ants and small children - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the end of 2014 it was virtually no longer possible , so the newspaper has a reference to the difficult situation on site .
after the Dublin agreement , the EU state is responsible for refugees of the EU state to reach them first .
if a Mig@@ rant travels to another EU country , this state can send him back to the travelling eland .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for reasons , write the Office now : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the mounting capacity for families with minor children in Italy greatly increases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy gave the accommodation for the reception and accommodation of families .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( E@@ GM@@ R ) consider these commitments for adequate .
other EU countries would return to refugees within the Dublin agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the internal political spokes@@ person in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Yel@@ p@@ ke critici@@ zed this decision : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; families with children thre@@ aten because of the shortcomings in the Italian asylum system of human rights and a haz@@ ard of the kin@@ ship &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Bank of England will keep interest rates by 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will remain unchanged , after the weak economic growth and mi@@ tigation of inflation will have shr@@ ink over a rise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England has warned that economic growth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will remain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as they held the interest rates on family income in the middle of an intensi@@ fying pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the political decision of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 for holding interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , whereby less members had an increase in this month , since the weak economic growth have weak@@ ened the support for an increase .
in its quarterly report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1,@@ 7 % and for 2018 to 1.6 % , and warned that pressure on household income would continue , whereby inflation in autumn is expected to rise to barely 3 % .
but they are sign@@ alized that in the next few years Z@@ deplo@@ y would be necessary to breed the inflation of Bre@@ xit and she said that the credit card may cost more than expected to rise to the financial markets .
members also voted this to withdraw part of the Mam@@ mut economic package that was issued before a year after the Bre@@ xit .
it will demand time for the financial plan to provide cheaper finance for banks , although it is expected to be expected to provide 15 billion pounds , more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds of Sterling .
minutes after deciding on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central progn@@ osis of the M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak , as the pressure on the real income of households will continue to use the consumption . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the interest rates , they repeated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain accus@@ ation of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the cooling of inflation and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; somewhat greater &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extent would be necessary than markets await . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the markets forecast currently progn@@ osis for the first rise in the third quarter of the next year and another year 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Bank stressed that enhancements would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; progressive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the growth forecasts taken down by the bank for this and next year are compared with the 1.9 % and 1.9 % in the year .
it has maintained its growth forecasts up to 1.8 % in the year 2018 .
the pound fell after these messages compared to the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell from 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.@@ 4 % to 1.@@ 11 Euro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision to no change comes after the recent dis@@ appoint growth rates have shr@@ unk from rising expectations on a fence and increased GDP in the second quarter of 0.3 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % in the previous three months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
growth will be expected in the third quarter , although it will be easily rec@@ u@@ perate after the Bank at the end of the year .
the most recent In@@ fl@@ ation@@ ary report offered little enthusiasm for households , which are affected by an increasing inflation and s@@ ligh@@ ten c@@ ages , as the shar@@ pen@@ ing first gets worse before it will be repaired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that monetary policy may not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent monetary policy in the coming years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but she added that wages will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recover at the end of their three @-@ year forecast . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is due to the weak pound due to what a portion of lower consumer expenditure is compens@@ ated .
the decision is one year after lowering interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % in the last August after the sho@@ cking EU vote , which resulted in the t@@ ines of the body @-@ causing .
the Bank appreci@@ ates that it will likely take four years until this will be fully reaching the prices and the economy .
before the last judgment of the Bank to the interest rates , the call for a re @-@ profit has risen , since inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ reli@@ eved households , with three political decision @-@ makers in July a rise in 0.5 % demanded .
inflation has declined in June to 2.9 % in June , although the Bank said that this was expected , and again in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said that crossing in relation to their target of 2 % is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wholly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to write a weak pound . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director at Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ us@@ Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; given the recent withdrawal of s@@ wap rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be more competitive , since the len@@ ders would prefer to quit businesses and end the year in positive ways .
the market looks particularly well for those in which the existing De@@ als are running and the new mort@@ g@@ ages completed , and many with toll @-@ free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( The National Health Service ) is supposed to be controversial from HIV @-@ drug 10,000 people
&quot; &quot; &quot; patients will receive access to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HIV prevention treatment in September after a fight against the financing of the drug in N@@ HS . &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS England announced that a prior to intercourse has been absorbed in prevention of proph@@ yla@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) , which can reduce the infection risks by about 86 percent , now being delivered by healthcare via a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he agreed to finance the process after the Appe@@ als Court confirmed a judgement of the Supreme Court of Justice that the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the Pr@@ EP despite the claim that local authorities should finance him .
the case announced on Thursday , was welcomed by N@@ HS England Chef Simon Stev@@ ens as a &quot; important new intervention &quot; during the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) , referred to as the &quot; decisive moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Brigh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield are among the first to be followed by people and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced in the UK in April 2018 .
prevention of proph@@ yla@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) is a result of HIV medicines that are taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that Pr@@ EP significantly reduced HIV transmission with inf@@ ectiv@@ es .
Pr@@ EP prior to sexual intercourse means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .
such medications can be taken every day or so already two hours before intercourse .
to those who arrive for the treatment in question include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexual and persons with HIV @-@ positive partners who have not been treated successfully .
in clinics the participants are identified that the study agree , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV @-@ status is not controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people who live in England and registered with a physician may also register for a possible participation in their local participating sexual clinic .
the program will under@@ signed £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed an agreement to supply the drugs within this week after an international competitive procurement .
the study aims to assess the entire potential of the Pr@@ EP by presenting clinical sc@@ opes as it is target@@ ing and implemented in a large scale .
Stev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should be the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to reduce HIV and over@@ hau@@ l HIV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades lasting progress in coping with one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deb@@ orah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National Aids Trust ) said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ EP , if it is targeted to vulnerable and endangered people , the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from September to people with high HIV risk access to this N@@ HS @-@ financed attempt in England will have to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and is not subject to a negotiation with a partner which leads to improving many , many lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ian Green , Chairman of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority now needs to be carried out quickly all over the country and that no one who has left a risk for HIV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now because the Pr@@ EP test medicine was created , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected persons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , shadows @-@ health mini@@ stries , said : &quot; the start of the Pr@@ EP @-@ process is welcome after months of delays and hes@@ it@@ ated execution by the government .
the evidence shows how trans@@ lu@@ ding this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can terminate the transmission of this living changing infection .
this attempt brings us one step closer to the understanding of the benefits of Pr@@ EP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected with HIV and that they will contribute to the end of the spread of HIV in society a step closer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the big life live : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment in a generous home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former banker with a passion for real estate , dropped from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court apartment .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it &apos;s a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed their bags and sold .
&quot; before I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; says Jo@@ anne .
&quot; I was looking for something that was comparable to my price .
this apartment was shown in Ear@@ ls Court , and it had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have fallen in love with them and made an offer on this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square square was completely rebuilt .
originally a one @-@ room property with a sli@@ pped layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add cup@@ board and a mezzanine to optimize the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .
that was my request , &quot; says it .
for this purpose she gave the architecture and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed from Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use 12,@@ 5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms to each other , leaving the architectural challenge in it , to create a mezzanine in which one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the default .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the steel plant is quite complicated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were over@@ riding each other without having to handle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not just about building a simple platform but to create the steel so that it had the right height for the function up or down . &quot;
this order allowed it to place Er@@ fan , two rooms in full height - with a lot of additional drama .
for the mezzanine , a classic copper window from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
gest@@ ures : gold furniture , sil@@ ver@@ ne Ak@@ z@@ ente and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille illumination set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .
on both ends there is a short corridor mir@@ r@@ ored to allow him to work longer .
in the kitchen the mirror feels like a window into another room .
at the entrance mir@@ r@@ ored units open space for all corners and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
due to the perception of a gl@@ am@@ our@@ able space the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .
Inter@@ fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering arts went inside , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel , fur@@ ni@@ fied M@@ DF @-@ door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is particularly important , so if you push the door to the door , very easy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage box Jo@@ anne could gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the base area - or how your property is valued , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ ding form a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the floor size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they have managed to enlarge the surface area and at the same time use high quality materials that get the room its luxurious advantage .
&quot; the materials are the things you touch and which therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; you do not love yourself into the electric so@@ ckets in the walls .
these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment is characterized by good design and elevated square met@@ abolic rate of something very astonishing .
in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave them .
brothers fight for an 500 million US dollar property .
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty in an argument because of one of the largest property imperial Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as worth over 500 million dollars .
the former Director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football @-@ Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their assets should be divided .
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp confrontation of the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , brothers 38 properties have accumulated in the value of more than half a billion dollars , since the family since 1973 bought a shop at Smith Street , Col@@ ling@@ wood .
he founded the family West@@ co je@@ ans and grew up to a chain of 160 retailers .
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
this money has been invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis now comprises offices in ci@@ at@@ rum , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping m@@ alls in the subur@@ ban .
&quot; &quot; &quot; following an agreement with her late Father , Col@@ in - from Paul as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; main driver and the dominant personality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; described in the family De Lu@@ tis - about two thirds of the company &apos;s desire and Paul about a third . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a judicial system states that it means that Col@@ in property possesses a value of 3@@ 16 million dollars and Paul at the value of 17@@ 6 million dollars .
the division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the distribu@@ tions proposed by the Col@@ in have left him with what I held for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote it in the first Aff@@ id@@ av@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday followed by several failed intermedi@@ aries , the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice .
the brothers also fight for control over the existing business - of which Col@@ in , as Paul claims , have declared him .
Col@@ in argued that this is not true , but casts Paul ahead , some possessions in@@ competent to manage .
in an early aff@@ id@@ av@@ it that was filed by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to teach the battle .
&quot; my Italian heritage writes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote .
the costs rise in the case with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports of companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck C@@ ram@@ er , and with leading lawyers , including All@@ an My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and by both sides of law firm .
Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delicacies from the late 1950 @-@ 1990s and purchased a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early se@@ ven@@ ties .
they used the security to buy the Col@@ ling@@ wood songs , in the col@@ on the first je@@ ans of the family opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Col@@ in says that he began the West there when he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in my last years of High School , when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped their property to pass on to their sons in 2012 .
&quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , &quot; wrote them .
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis @-@ group of companies , whereby Col@@ in claims that Mark were paid 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars .
both Luke and Mark are , so Paul says about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot;
Col@@ in has proved very back , although he was a former AF@@ L board member , and after a biography from 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of the TV Icon .
Fair@@ fax Media participated in touch with Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their attor@@ neys .
only Col@@ in answered by SMS to say &quot; I really can not say much , &quot; because the case before the courts be .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very sad , very sad that my brother got decided to disgu@@ ise me and to pull our family names by the dishes , &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 Col@@ in wrote in writing to the court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not have known that Paul and I would end in our current fight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said and added that he still hope for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday these hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our business will be solved in the near future by the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Col@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tru@@ mp@@ s new Bar is planning to restrict the media @-@ st@@ in@@ ence of the president .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if yes , he will be the first .
polis reports that the new bar of the White House is planning to limit the flow of information to President Tru@@ mp - including the reports of news media - in hope to hold the boss at an even more ev@@ enly course .
here is a piece of Re@@ porter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new staff of the White House , met at his first working day at senior staff , he exhibited a major problem in President Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s White House , which he intends to repair : poor information that entered into the hands of the president .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kelly told the staff that information on him should flow - whether on paper or in correspondence - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
wa@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame tru@@ mp by super@@ v@@ ise its media assets .
President Tru@@ mp@@ s relationship to TV shows decades back - and now , where he is in the White House , his TV commerci@@ als is still strong .
&quot; if Candi@@ date was anno@@ yed because of a fair trial , it was productive to show him that he was a fair reporting of places that were to convince , &quot; said the former election consultant Sam Nun@@ berg in February to Poli@@ tico .
Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote to the time that &quot; the key to keep Tru@@ mp@@ s Twitter habit under control , according to six former election campaign officials to ensure that his personal media has a constant praise . &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tru@@ mp@@ s Twitter habit ever &apos; under control &quot; was ridic@@ ulous .
perhaps this campaign we know something we would not know others - that Tru@@ mp@@ s T@@ we@@ ets would not have more igni@@ tion without their interventions .
we will probably never experience anything about the twe@@ ets , the Tru@@ mp has not been sent .
if his staff managed to keep it away several times , anger , then their efforts have been worthwhile .
but nobody has it consistently can prevent Tru@@ mp Contro@@ ls .
part of the problem is that people in a White House which sets out from competing parties , always try to present their own agenda by promoting Tru@@ mp Material that may help their views from the world .
polis - very busy with this story - reported in May on the preference of the advis@@ ors , the president for strategic reasons beyond doubt .
this was an example which was described by Re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recent and former Tru@@ mp officials say that Tru@@ mp can react as a volcano on negative press cuts , especially those with sh@@ ame@@ ful le@@ aks , and that he sti@@ ff@@ ed out how these originate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this happened at the end of February when someone had a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet pro@@ vocation Charles C. Johnson , who accused the dep@@ uty rod of K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; the source behind a bunch of being in the White House .
although Johnson was banned from Twitter because of a slide show or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he has vo@@ iced false accus@@ ations in the past and rev@@ oked it .
Tru@@ mp read the article and started to ask people about Wal@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ maker added that the then @-@ ge Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have tried to implement a system to manage and document the pap@@ er@@ work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how did it work ?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove to be more effective manager as a pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tru@@ mp is still his impul@@ sive Self and his advis@@ ors still strive for influence .
these un@@ altered factors make wa@@ ys mission very difficult .
masters of selected crimin@@ als get mail from Euro@@ pol
as the address is unknown , the help of the population will pray and up@@ lifted .
the police in all Europe are sent in this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards to dangerous crimin@@ als at the run .
as the addresses of the requested s@@ qui@@ ties are not known as stated , are evidence of the population and will pray .
Euro@@ pole reported on Friday from the action that follows the &quot; EU Most W@@ anted &quot; Advent Calendar from the winter .
the experiences would have shown that many wing@@ ed holiday destinations are to hide , it was part of Euro@@ pol .
we have put together 21 post@@ cards for selected crimin@@ als from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 , the website www.@@ eu@@ mo@@ st@@ ere , more than 2.5 million times was considered this .
36 of the online requested pages were so far been arrested , at least eleven of them due to hints after publication on the website .
travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; million@@ aires series &apos;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the weal@@ thi@@ est land@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands are again with some resol@@ ute travellers on war power , who have negotiated one from the commune of zo@@ omed dit@@ ch to re@@ claim a field in front of their men &apos;s houses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the travellers have their 20 caravan on a field outside a prosper@@ ous road of Soli@@ h@@ ull , which is called the &quot; million@@ aires series . &quot;
they have brought horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters after they were raised only in May without being de@@ ported from one of the council for grab@@ bing ra@@ ging to prevent their accidents .
the tac@@ tical group found a gap in the defense units and dra@@ gged their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
angry people have oppressed the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull , who said it is useless to deal with the problem . &quot;
an anonymous residents said , &quot; They were moved there on Monday , after they were sent by Bentley He@@ ath , where they cast stones at the pass@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council must be forced by shame to put into action because it was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the travellers were in May there , were moved further and are now back again .
more arrived yesterday evening , probably today more . &quot;
she added : &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to deal with it by holding long periods to protect their parks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I live along the road brook Road and I am not happy to continue to pay my church ste@@ el when the Council cannot stop it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a local , who not wanted to be called said : &quot; it &apos;s ridic@@ ulous , we have just seen the last round of this trav@@ eller to be lo@@ oted from another round .
the numbers have raised this time and you even have seen a horse in the parking area . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ person of Soli@@ h@@ ull said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are aware of an unauthorized camp in the country beyond the stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps so that they will continue as quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to support our evidence of evidence , it is very important that as many people as many people report an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour in the police by calling 101 101 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation where the court must consider when we will submit our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Birken@@ hof , Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Birken@@ hof the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise won .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts is currently being renovated and will be opened again on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closure of the hotel Birken@@ hof through the then ambience of the factory company mbH to the 13th of April 2014 , approximately 30 000 nights were lost per year and also revenues from the tourist tax .
in the autumn of 2014 , in view of the dramatic numbers of refugees who came into the country , the hotel building is offered to the Land@@ rat@@ ory as collective accommodation , which was conceived for controversy .
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
at that time the decision was not un@@ disp@@ uted at that time .
but above all Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts Julian Os@@ s@@ wald defended the hotel location and spoke at that time of serious prospective buyers at the house .
he should be right .
the group Lu@@ isen@@ Hotels with a manager Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer with its head office in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern has acquired the former Hotel Birken@@ hof with a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it again a house of three @-@ star plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städter object 4 houses .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad men@@ al@@ b .
you are hot Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the earlier Hotel Birken@@ hof has been standing for a longer time construction container before the entrance , and if you enter the house , it becomes clear what extensive renovation work will be done .
the so@@ ils were cut out , blankets to the part demol@@ ished , old bath@@ tu@@ bs from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
until March there is still much to do .
&quot; it is actually a lovely place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything is to be renewed in the Black @-@ style .
the rooms are equipped with large outdoor showers , the entrance area will be re@@ designed , it will be installed in new windows .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything should be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beautiful bourgeois &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make a jewelry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room are among the facilities .
if you do not want to position itself at the high level of hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bath , but already on an up@@ scale downtown level , empha@@ sizes Sch@@ erer .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to pop up wide , explains how to continue .
both individual holiday@@ makers , groups or business@@ men should feel at home in the hotel .
talks with ob Julian Os@@ s@@ wald and Tour@@ direc@@ tor Michael Kr@@ ause , he has already led .
the performances of the city shall be the same with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer did not want to specify exactly the amount of the investments .
just under a million euros , he reck@@ ons .
also the external systems are brought into front , which is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard , a large terrace comes from the restaurant , which is open to the public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ aires : U.S. Special Offer sets the Grand Jury
in the Russia @-@ affair for US @-@ president Donald Tru@@ mp is supposed to have a so @-@ called Grand Jury in Russia after a report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Panel included the work over the past few weeks , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the paper took the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller has extended and intensified its investigations .
the CN@@ N Sender that reported it already first dischar@@ ges of the committee in connection with a meeting between Tru@@ mp@@ s oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
us @-@ intelligence services acc@@ ul@@ ed the Kre@@ m@@ lin since longer , specifically to be mixed in the presidential election 2016 .
Mu@@ eller examines whether there were agreements between Tru@@ mp@@ s electoral team and Moscow .
in the focus of investig@@ ators there are several men who acted in the election campaign as consultants of the re@@ public@@ ans .
according to report , Mu@@ eller also took more and more Tru@@ mp@@ s private and business environment under the magni@@ fying glass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the special gu@@ ardi@@ er Tru@@ mp was personally moved to the center and seek the accus@@ ation , whether the president is in the course of the affair possibly imp@@ eded the judiciary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys is to review and decide the present evidence in possible ent@@ ang@@ lements and to decide whether the indictment shall be ex@@ al@@ ted .
Grand Jur@@ ys will therefore also be called charges .
mostly they will be switched on when it deals with greater and controversy in controversy .
the process is always carried out behind closed doors .
the body can also be switched on by the Pro@@ sec@@ utor &apos;s Office , to help persons for loading under E@@ id .
according to the CN@@ N , pre @-@ dischar@@ ges have already been issued , which revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tru@@ mp J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
individuals involved in the meeting were asked to a statement called it was in the report .
moreover , they should provide documents .
in addition to Tru@@ mp J@@ r. also Tru@@ mp@@ s Consultant and father @-@ in @-@ son J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner as well as his dam@@ al@@ ous election manager Paul Man@@ a@@ fort at the meeting .
right @-@ right said on Thursday night in US television that shows that Mu@@ eller didn &apos;t let themselves be shy in his work and that he should be if it should be necessary to act quickly .
but it must not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be switched on in the end to decide on the survey of an indictment .
nevertheless , the inc@@ ision of the Gre@@ mi@@ um is the beginning of a new phase in the studies and a new cause of concern for President Tru@@ mp .
in the midst of the new revelations , the President on Thursday night will present a speech in West Virginia to present Russia &apos;s affair as a campaign against his political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia @-@ history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the theme gives the Democrats a way to feel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good to feel good because they have nothing else about which they can talk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special advisor T@@ y Cob@@ b declared in an opinion , he know nothing about the composition of a Grand Jury .
and these are usually working in secret , he stressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the White House challenged all measures , accelerated the labour of the special &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former F@@ BI chef James Com@@ ey made three times said that not against the president .
you have no reason to suppose that something changed , it was in the explanation .
but Mu@@ eller was only used after Tru@@ mp Com@@ ey .
because of this root , accus@@ ations against Tru@@ mp were noisy , he did not want to inter@@ fere with the judiciary .
Com@@ ey said in June before a Senate Committee , Tru@@ mp asked him to be asked for an attitude of investigations against the then national security advis@@ ors Michael Fl@@ ynn .
the president is under great pressure due to the examination .
after the display of US media , the White House gathered material against the special gu@@ ardian and its staff .
the sol@@ dering spec@@ ulation about whether Tru@@ mp Mu@@ eller wants to dis@@ miss .
unlike an independent proxy of Congress such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate Aff@@ aires around the later President Richard Ni@@ x@@ on , Mu@@ eller has a position in which it theoretically could be found at D@@ rän@@ gen of the President of the Ministry of Finance .
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to bend such a step .
two groups of Republi@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators put on Thursday law@@ suit , after which the special gu@@ ardian could no longer be released as easy .
Ant@@ arctic : gigantic ic@@ eberg drives in the Ant@@ arc@@ tica
in the West@@ ant@@ arctic , a gigantic ic@@ eberg was solved by the scar@@ ring size of Berlin from the Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ i .
this divided the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred We@@ gener Institute for Polar - and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the one tri@@ l@@ lion tonnes of heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometers of large Col@@ ony dri@@ vet@@ ail now to the north and will probably be two , three years until he was mel@@ ted .
it is with 175 kilometers of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , one of the largest ic@@ eberg that researchers have registered over the past three decades .
a danger for people does not go out of it .
to what extent the climate change has played a role in the break@@ age of the ic@@ eberg , according to research , is unclear .
in total , there have been a series of unusual break@@ downs of ice cream break@@ downs in the region for approximately 30 years , writes the U.S. research center for snow and ice ( NS@@ ID@@ C ) in an Fak@@ background .
according to many researchers , this could be related to the heating level .
the broken Kol@@ oss was so far a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ i .
Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is floating on the sea and is fed by large gl@@ aci@@ ers .
it thus grows further into the sea and breaks regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is located south of South America almost at the top of the Ant@@ arctic peninsula .
North of this shr@@ ub was the balance of wa@@ xes and ab@@ om@@ iting several years ago .
a complete fe@@ eder is there to fall , AW@@ I @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
I know some thing that also the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is in danger , because the front edges have never as far withdrawn as currently .
moreover , the ice plate stands under voltage and can be broken down if at a key point a piece is slow@@ ed down .
the mel@@ ting of Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is and ic@@ eberg increases the level as it does not swim in the water and ice creams as much water as it yields after the melt itself .
however , the loss of the cord finish that the gl@@ aci@@ ers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before .
this could possibly increase the sea level , but only in the low measure , the British research project writes to the observation of the Ant@@ arc@@ tica ( MID@@ AS ) .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is after AW@@ I information with almost 50 000 square kilometres , the fourth largest Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is the Ant@@ arc@@ tica .
at the passage from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front @-@ edge to the free ocean about 200 meters .
there it will break on a regular basis .
&quot; although it is a natural occurrence and has no direct connection to climate change , the ice shield is now in a dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British Sw@@ an@@ sea University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the shortest retreat since the beginning of the records , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confirmed also . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among scientists be controversial , whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ses@@ is now back again be back or long run back and possibly merge his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last decades .
even if these researchers lead the departure of this gigantic ic@@ eberg not to climate change , so in the past decades many ic@@ ar@@ ching of the ant@@ arctic peninsula are dis@@ cer@@ tained .
this long back of the Ant@@ arc@@ tica extends in the direction of South America .
according to the data of the research programme British Ant@@ arctic Survey , the polar surface of the Ant@@ arctic peninsula has gone back to 28 000 square kilometers since the 195@@ 0s .
to fall I have contributed to the temperature .
the Ant@@ arctic peninsula has gone by around three degrees in the past 50 years and t@@ apped in the areas where the temperature is fastest .
CD@@ U does front of the staff
because it becomes more and more difficult to occupy free positions , the CD@@ U calls to step out of the employer association to become more attractive .
only shortly before the summer break , the K@@ rei@@ ther gave up 41 new jobs in the administration .
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the administration office in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 appren@@ tices have their first working day after themselves .
the cur@@ riculum of the circle are apparently highly desirable .
around 6@@ 20 applications were to be found for the places in this year .
however , the circle continues to cope with personnel in order to cope with the raised requirements and tasks .
currently , there is at the circle of M@@ ett@@ mann still 50 years ago .
among other things doctors and engineers , as well as forces of general administration .
the CD@@ U would now wish to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and seize the skilled heat in the administration .
the administration is to develop a concept for recruitment and human resources according to the wishes of the parties . &quot;
the aim is to cover not only short @-@ term requirements for professionals , but future @-@ oriented application of the applicants , it means .
the overall concept should be based inside and outside , concrete measures for cross @-@ clim@@ bers , and include an educational background , call for CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
this is already listening to a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personal problems , which one did not know earlier .
other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive terms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is from a regular &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this purpose , a high number of employees comes to divor@@ ce from the ministry .
so , the highest time to action so that no more places are un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter Pe@@ et , President of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the common request with his party .
he had long ago at the K@@ rei@@ ving for a lazy surprise when he was publicly asked for the personnel @-@ cover , and the rest of the other parties was ast@@ ounding .
people want to be verified that all possibilities are verified that allow an exit from the local employer association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we come here at short notice to a satisfying solution , the circuits with the unions - maybe also in collaboration with the county @-@ affiliated towns - a bon@@ net if &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says peoples . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this makes the CD@@ U , the employees and officials pay a better pay when it is actually fores@@ aw the collective service for the public service . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , increases or more money is only when you switch to a higher level that is oriented towards career years .
however , the tasks of the circle have grown steadily over the past few years .
only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up in which employees are concerned with the provisions of the new pro@@ stitutes .
not least because of the growing number of asylum seekers , coun@@ cill@@ ors Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ dire@@ ktor Martin Richter a problem : you have too little staff .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy exac@@ erb@@ ated the tone to NGOs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; NGO @-@ migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned the lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean Sea , warned that they cannot continue this if they do not adhere to new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if NGOs don &apos;t submit a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , &quot; said Interior Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Tur@@ iner daily La St@@ amp@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Min@@ niti@@ o &apos;s warning came one day after the Italian authorities had a boat of the German aid organisation &apos; youth R@@ ettet &apos; conf@@ is@@ cated because their team had worked effectively with human traff@@ ics in a way that facilitated the illegal immigration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aid organisation that has been commissioned only for one year , refused to express themselves with detailed forecast of the Italian public prosec@@ utor Amb@@ ro@@ gio Cart@@ osi@@ o .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us and remains the salvation of human life our top priority . so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organization in an opinion about social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only assess all alleg@@ ations that are currently raised , after all the information collected and the situation can be judged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had observed the boat from &apos; youth R@@ ettet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , which has been super@@ vis@@ ing since October .
it is thought that his crew takes a hose boat @-@ migrants on board that can be delivered directly by human traff@@ ick@@ ers and that the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gler can be worn down so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting place , only 1,3 miles before the Libyan coast took place , according to the acts of the Pro@@ sec@@ utor , whose content was published by Italian media .
the occupation is susp@@ icious , dealing with the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives .
under the Code of Conduct , boats like the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta must especially have an Italian police action on board that monitors their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far been prepared to hold back to the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable , since they would not bring a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; significant changes or disabilities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of their lif@@ ebo@@ ards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refuse to sign himself is the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate organization doctors without borders ( MS@@ F ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Minn@@ iti said meanwhile , that the number of migrants had gone back to the rescue operations in Italy , have gone back strongly in recent weeks that the efforts to strengthen the Libyan Coast Guard and collabor@@ ated with the local citizens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last days we started to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he gave plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ ad , Niger , and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants that leave these countries in hope to reach Europe .

for this there were three friendly guides available .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heim valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the castle and W@@ einf@@ est of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour led to hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim .
it followed view points , some of which you could look far over the Pf@@ ro@@ zer forest and the up@@ stream levels .

console instead of lawn - Bundesliga are for e @-@ sports
are the sport stars in the future sitting before computer consoles , rather than to fight against wind and weather over the state of state ?
the fact is : e @-@ Sport has long since become a serious industry , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high grid .
these have also identified the first Federal Republic of the Federal Republic , which are increasingly active in this field .
the beginning of 2015 at the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later followed the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , which established an e @-@ sports department in the middle of July and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 under the contract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to make new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the board of Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that on this move further associations can ascend &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the World Cup of World Cup organised in London the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , where the gam@@ er of various clubs will compete in London .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven were qualified .
Robin Dut@@ t sees great potential in the e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ Trainer by Bayer Lever@@ k@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen now advis@@ es an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real football must deal particularly with the 14 to 30 years old , that young people also go into the stadium in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian .
most prominent e @-@ athletes under contract could be found online by far more often on these markets than once in the year to send the federal government to Asia .
what is it exactly ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the e @-@ Sport computer games such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ot@@ A 2 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or even the football simulation of FIFA on competitors plane . &quot; &quot; &quot;
long ago , as in normal sport also , Li@@ gen is established , in which the professionals compete against each other .
and with the Asian @-@ play E @-@ Sport is already part of the official program .
but is it a real kind of sport ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for many , the performance is safe and vulnerable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ se has long been dealing with the question .
for the professor at the Deutsche Spor@@ tho@@ chschule in Cologne is e @-@ sport a sport because it &apos;s com@@ peti@@ tive and showing many biological and physical responses , which you can also find in classic sports - for example , higher heart frequencies , hormonal changes , hormonal changes .
besides , there are cognitive abilities , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a quick response ability .
professional gam@@ ers should not only exercise on the console , but also exercise their body and watch the diet .
&quot; the f@@ itte player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but F@@ rob@@ us can also see problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intelligence is becoming more and more a theme . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls are difficult to perform in online games , and in the scene l@@ acked the structures of classical sport .
the scientists also highlights the high integr@@ ative action of the E @-@ Sports .
the players are on the way , which is like a great global family , there are no cross @-@ cultural events .
a study of corporate consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association Interactive Entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) says the e @-@ sport a rapid growth .
in 2016 , more than 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly about advertising , sponsorship and great tournaments .
sales at 130 million will be expected in three years .
against the nearly 2,@@ 4 billion euros of the Bundesliga , this is little .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the E @-@ Sport &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is no longer far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice @-@ ho@@ ckey &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte advis@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
international are many countries already on .
big markets are Asia and the US , where Ex @-@ Bas@@ ket@@ ball@@ ers Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez will participate in the US team NGOs .
Hollywood actor Ashton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sport @-@ Wett@@ stein Uni@@ kr@@ n .
also in Europe there is a lot of things .
in a Norwegian school e @-@ sports was introduced as a class@@ y , says F@@ rob@@ se .
in the Netherlands and in France the Berlin @-@ Initi@@ al@@ liga @-@ Institu@@ tions are meanwhile obligated to set up an e @-@ sports department .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European comparison , Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B @-@ board R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only in nostal@@ gia to fall , and the old times to be clari@@ fied , is no longer enough today .
it is about keeping the tradition of the association , but the company will be able to align the modern market at the same time .
&quot; we live in a digi@@ tised world , &quot; says Dut@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there you can &apos;t remember that only when football remains everything that it was always . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michelle Carter , because of the texts , the Con@@ rad Roy push for su@@ icide , condemned
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she has encouraged her friend through lyrics and calls for su@@ icide .
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind gri@@ ds and five years were exposed to currency .
Carter was sentenced to life in June because of the neg@@ ligent killing of Con@@ rad , who took life on 13 July 2014 .
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is inno@@ cent .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to stay free until calling .
she had been confronted with a maximum of 20 years , but their legal representative argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness .
dressed in red p@@ ants and a cre@@ me@@ ek Bl@@ use , Carter stand with tears in the eyes , with folded hands and down@@ ward eyes , when it was condemned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your actions have brought Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ ut@@ ors to the court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she ended his life to make her own better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she has no responsibility taken over , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has not shown a repentance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ters lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible circum@@ stance which they are un@@ fortunate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said however , he did not find that her &quot; age or maturity or even their spiritual disease have a significant impact on their actions . &quot;
a prosec@@ utor was reading a statement by Ro@@ ys mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who poss@@ essed that there is &quot; no day when I don &apos;t have the loss of my beloved Son .
I want that he is proud of me and how I go with everything . I try , despite all my pain@@ s that we will carry for eternity with us to be there for his sisters , &quot; says therein .
Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she will be prosec@@ uted by the knowledge , &quot; she will never take part in the wedding of her brother or would be a a@@ unt for his children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not to have this single person with which I was given every day since my birth , is a pain that I will always keep to me for the rest of my life &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to place a legal preced@@ ent since there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to commit a different su@@ icide .
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon oxid@@ ation in a vehicle in 2014 .
the case drew national attention to himself , after Car@@ ters text releases revealed that she had encouraged him to finish his life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hung up on the spring of a building , I try yourself , I do not know there are many ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said in several news , who had sent them in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in those moments before his su@@ icide , she wrote : &quot; you have to do it , Con@@ rad &quot; and &quot; All that you have to do is to turn the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter was looking for attention through the death of Roy and ord@@ ained that they should benefit by any Press from the case .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
among the few , the Carter defended , belonged to Amanda Kno@@ x , who was sentenced in 2007 for murder in her British fellow @-@ resident in Italy before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago .
Ms. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published in the Los Angeles Times a comment : &quot; Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ mir : learn from the new Mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua was able to run myself at the Audi Cup as a captain , is not a coincidence .
the FC Bayern tr@@ aut the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner for a big season - Extra motivation was not ground@@ ed .
anything that was different on his place in the cabin , that looked Joshua Kim@@ ps immediately , even if the extra gar@@ ment was very , very small .
but as far and wide on the second day of Audi C@@ ups of course no Philipp Lah@@ m and also no Manuel Neu@@ er was to be seen , he made himself his shared amp@@ de at the arm .
&quot; the trainer has not announced it , &quot; told the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner , after his first use as Bavaria @-@ captain .
good , the one could have been able to run better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the sign of the coach could also indicate me so .
not the eight year older Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al was born in youth play@@ ers , cle@@ ans and just out of the holiday of the professionals existing C @-@ El@@ f as a game leader , but he .
sugar is distributed in the most loved ones to those who love to hold a lot in the mood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who thus was au@@ c@@ ably to establish the inheritance of Lah@@ m , can only use a small extra motivation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kim@@ mir confirmed : &quot; that is what you want as a player wants to take on responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday flow@@ ed of the 22 @-@ year @-@ old as mini @-@ Lah@@ m over the field .
to the right behind , this is now its position , the white Bin@@ de at the arm did its rest .
and at all he studied in this starting formation as the one who can take the rod best into your hand .
he gave instructions , tried to ste@@ er the un@@ locked tro@@ upe .
he had the view for the whole , while many others were busy with themselves .
Vid@@ al therefore , to over@@ play its lack of fitness ( folding hardly ) ; Renato San@@ ches to make the devil com@@ b out to the services of Asia @-@ journey ( folding also only partly ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le , in their first appearance in the Bayern @-@ Tri@@ kot not negative .
after all , this would be very good .
Sü@@ le ran off with Kim@@ mir , Rud@@ y in front of the defense , both acted sou@@ ps .
the nam@@ ously occupied Napoli @-@ storm was often difficult , and also tried addi@@ le to be successful in the playing building a few times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his colleague Rud@@ y gave to that the result &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was not as we had hoped for us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also he showed a decent performance at the debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; relocation , temp@@ o @-@ change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this style I was also fet@@ ched . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as un@@ acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed this Bavaria world is still in connection with the new , one saw subsequently to the game .
Rud@@ y : for example , there was no one or two , but surely six or seven interviews .
Kim@@ oto passed away after a few cris@@ p statements on the back of his new fellow @-@ players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there he listened to an interesting set of an interesting set : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is going on here now I have already marked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with Bayern you just need to win each game . &quot;
after all , he does not have to teach the new no more .

company satisfied with rh@@ et@@ land @-@ pe@@ eling ministers : economy lo@@ aves Wis@@ sings Tempo
in fact , there were often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) is still the Minister of Economic Affairs in the Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
this is reflected in more than one year in which the new Economic Affairs Minister Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak at T V @-@ inquiry from a shift in economic policy - and bl@@ ames simultaneously the old Minist@@ erial Foundation .
Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association Tri@@ der companies ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wis@@ sing acc@@ esses the desires of the economy , the Lem@@ ke has all blocked . &quot;
the biggest turn@@ around sees Nat@@ us in the infrastructure policy : the brid@@ ging of the highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the country &apos;s priority list .
still this year the ministry hopes to be a planning procedure , up to 2021 should be the building right .
a role in the plans of the country is also playing the western direction of Trier , which stands in the urgent need of the Federal State Plan .
the aim is to take the route in December 2020 in operation , says Ar@@ eri@@ oth spre@@ cher@@ in Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
Nat@@ us sees it a sign@@ post to support regional , but internationally competing companies .
the Chamber of Commerce and Chamber of Commerce ( I@@ HK ) Trier will intend to stimulated by Wis@@ sing , while wine is a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate label to boost the paragraph in supermarkets and to stop the trend of serving German Wine exports .
in addition , Wis@@ sing is an open ear for people who want to start their own company , praise the Chamber of Commerce .
the Chamber of Cra@@ fts Trier will see an additional incentive for young appren@@ tices in the new master bonus , says Managing Director Matthias Schwal@@ bach .
fores@@ een is a premium of 1000 Euro for the best master examination and 2500 Euro if graduates are self @-@ confident within ten years after the master .
the home@@ work list for the country remains long .

Audi is supposed to change 85@@ 0.000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers are confronted with a bac@@ kl@@ ash .
a day before the announcement of Audi said BMW , that it would offer to update the software in more than 35@@ 0.000 vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the BMW Chairman said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are intelligent options as driving restrictions , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and related to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - to offer or restrict diesel vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes @-@ vehicles in Europe to reduce his diesel emissions .
none of the company described enterprises as a recall .
European car manufacturers strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
but the nitrogen oxi@@ des , which are diesel engines , are considered to be car@@ cin@@ o@@ genic and can cause as@@ thma .
the cost of Autom@@ obile Manufac@@ turer , systems for neutr@@ alization of the diesel engine to install , take also what it makes it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel will also be charged to pl@@ unge the powerful automobile firms and ignore signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called de@@ preci@@ ation devices that regul@@ ates emissions if a car was tested , but with normal driving conditions .
in the United States several employees were charged by Volkswagen , others will be examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month the former head of the Ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ics was arrested by Audi in Germany last month .
the former manager , Zac@@ ch@@ eo Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Italian and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be placed in the United States .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigation by Volkswagen , after the authorities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Audi accused who have installed a system to deal with emission regulations in Europe , and a request that was concentrated in the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the inclusion of Audi into the investigation could be extremely difficult to strain : the luxury car manufacturer carries a proportional to the profit of Volkswagen .

in the first years as an artist , he suggested among other things as a drawing of luck , making it frustr@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the main person in the movie &quot; Crazy Island &quot; is a gi@@ raffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los test@@ es animal in his drawings - who has a thous@@ and@@ s@@ ler as a counter @-@ player .
for the first time his figures speak in the 3D movie , the 2019 is to come to the cinema wall .
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it is strange for me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo .
the script is not written by it .
that is why it is rather related to the TV series , which is produced like its original design@@ ations , liter@@ al .
lav@@ ender made from Provence threatened by climate change
he has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .
the lav@@ ender is because of the case of dro@@ ught remin@@ ding conditions and because of the illness @-@ borne insects declined , what scientists and farmers trying to find solutions , great head@@ aches are prepared .
Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the agricultural research institution of CRI@@ EP@@ P@@ AM in Provence , said : &quot; the lav@@ ender in Provence is effectively je@@ op@@ ardis@@ ed because the plant was exposed to the impact of climate change , which has brought much less rain in the spring and in autumn much more .
this has effects on the life span of lav@@ ender .
there is also a small ornamental , a micro @-@ bacter@@ ium that we@@ ars the Zwerg@@ zi@@ k@@ ades , and with very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is much on the game .
lav@@ ender oil attracts not only to holiday@@ makers , it is also very sought for perf@@ ume and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said , &quot; instead of having very long plants with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , UN@@ TER@@ EN@@ TW@@ IC@@ K@@ EL@@ TE and either missing or weak@@ ened .
so we have less parts with etheric oil . &quot;
among the solutions that are considered to be considered a better water distribution and the slow@@ ing of the dar@@ ker out of the ground , but also the wi@@ dening of the plants with a protective mix of sound and water and the development of varieties that are resistant to dr@@ y@@ ness .
the town of Ge@@ isa in the Thur@@ in@@ gian R@@ hö@@ n celebrates its 1200 @-@ year anniversary .

the assass@@ ination of a journalist highlights the growing threat in Mexico
the employees of the weekly Rio@@ do@@ ce meet normally mit@@ es to check out their plans for coverage of the recent chaos in the state Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and ceas@@ eless drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of her own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
it was told to them that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ level journalists discuss what feels more secure : they are supposed to take their children to the office , who were in 2009 the aim of an attack with gran@@ ules , or make them at home .
security experts have three words written on a table on the front of the room : opponents , neutral , infl@@ ating .
they ask the re@@ porter , to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary , percep@@ tions and emo@@ tionally .
there are drugs mu@@ g@@ gler , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are susp@@ icious , on the secret list of the government or cart@@ els , a catalog of crimin@@ als that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no rest at the time of violence , and while throughout the country the corp@@ ses are frequent , there are more journalists : at least 25 , since president En@@ rique Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to took office in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are standing after attacks and threats under federal protection and until now there was at least seven deaths in seven countries this year .
among the latter is their publishers and their inspir@@ er of Rio@@ do@@ ce , the co @-@ founder of Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
its absence is felt deep even though its presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Val@@ dez presented his Middle @-@ finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; depends on the façade of the Rio@@ do@@ ce building . two re@@ por@@ ters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ barra and Miri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez , bear T @-@ shirts , who show his sm@@ iled face with glasses or its typical Pan@@ am@@ ut .
the workshop will take place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ porter will discuss their shared themes , the trau@@ ma , their night@@ mar@@ es , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although 2010 has been established a Son@@ der @-@ Federal Office , in order to deal with the case of journalists , these according to the Committee on the Protection of journalists has initiated only two criminal proceedings .
as with most thousands of murder , which are associated with drug and organised crime every year , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists will rarely be brought to justice .
in Rio@@ do@@ ce they still insist on the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are inno@@ cent , and although the terrain now is still obli@@ que .
without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting to discussion of security little benefit , says I@@ barra .
&quot; it is very sil@@ ly , my time spent in this workshop , &quot; says he .
&quot; as long as we know not the Why , we mi@@ str@@ ust all . &quot;
in the morning of 15 May Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Rio@@ do@@ ce in the provincial capital of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
he managed to drive a few blocks far before its red Toyota Cor@@ olla was comp@@ elled by two men . he was shot from his car and 12 times was shot at it , probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; T@@ wel@@ ded river . &quot;
the Sag@@ itt@@ arius went away in his car and damaged it near .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two grown children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an freely .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ mans ar@@ rests last year and the delivery to the United States in January was s@@ alo@@ a to become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , because ri@@ val@@ ing political groups are fighting here to fill the vacuum .
there is nothing that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or more people can be shot on the road or that the cemetery is full of ver@@ ted , two @-@ story Maus@@ er for drug royal , which are larger than many houses for the living .
forget for a minute that there is a state of &apos; peace &apos; if only a cart@@ el control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs routes in the United States has .
nevertheless and despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Rio@@ do@@ ce , with the guilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings have contributed to the murder .
first of all , in February the publication of an interview with Dam@@ as@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of a ri@@ val@@ ing cart@@ oons in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans children .
this publication may have anno@@ yed the sons , suspected veins bought every copy of the issue as soon as they were ex@@ tradi@@ ted to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ke .
the second fault was in it that Val@@ dez did not force to force after the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper which had published the same story to leave the country to its own security .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and its killing is regarded as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived his friends and colleagues , that he would always be there .
he was active in 2003 as an experienced re@@ porter for Nor@@ o@@ este , when he joined together with five colleagues for the founding of Rio@@ do@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars .
in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to operate journalism without encounter@@ ing the prey problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
at the time the newspaper earned a reputation for the coura@@ geous and honest reporting , and revenues and advertising took .
re@@ por@@ ters loved it , hard @-@ going investigations without fear of cens@@ or@@ ship , and readers were fascinated by a publication where they could read stories , which no one else to deal with .
eight years after the foundation of Rio@@ do@@ ce she received the pres@@ ch@@ illed &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot @-@ Prize &quot; for their reporting in Latin America .
in the same year Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the Protection of journalists for his courage in the persecution of the Mexican drugs of drugs , where ever they passed .
he gave voluntarily to that he was afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to go further , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of CP@@ J &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
drug trading in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a lifestyle , &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV last October .
&quot; you have to take over the task that falls you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would not want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what did you do in view of so many dead ... why did you not say what went before ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Rio@@ do@@ ce team mis@@ ses Val@@ dez , the Spa@@ ak , who was like a port worker , the friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always carry his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ abo , the bar across from the office , and always sit at the same table .
now they ask : was his love to be routine forever ?
his death has also comp@@ elled them to question their own assumptions regarding how they can do their work best and stay alive .
&quot; they don &apos;t like it if you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their home starting and cross @-@ cars , &quot; to move drugs .
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even at the best times , a high level of self @-@ cens@@ or@@ ship and self @-@ keeping .
to trust his own inst@@ inc@@ ts .
if it smells wrong , stay away from it .
the trouble is , the editor of the Rio@@ do@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real , that &quot; smell is a sense that can be dec@@ eived ... and then the thing with Javier has happened . &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , apply in Sin@@ alo@@ a no more - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states , in which a gi@@ fted mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative s@@ mu@@ g@@ ust routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home .
the landscape is constantly changing .
in the room where employees of Rio@@ do@@ ce met for security training were suddenly no mobile phones allowed . days before , sp@@ y@@ ware , which is sold exclusively on governments , used for monitoring journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside two polic@@ emen were faced in front of the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were instru@@ cted by the provincial government to protect the offices of Rio@@ do@@ ce in a four @-@ story building in a mid @-@ class district of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
half in the sh@@ re@@ porter , some of the re@@ porter was asking whether these officers are among the 50 percent of the police officers , which the governor himself considered not trusted .
it has been months since the re@@ porter has gone into the mountain landscape , where the drug ban@@ den de facto under control are under control .
for the issue of this week Rio@@ do@@ ce has put on three main stories .
there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of the former known box@@ ers Ju@@ lio Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an exo@@ pos@@ é of the government spending , concentrated on the hom@@ etown of the governor .
and there was a group that led in one of the most expensive restaurants in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the Pro@@ sec@@ utor &apos;s office , a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or how it happened , so caution was advisable when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows , that the restaurant is a favorite venue on drug dealers and authorities .
a re@@ porter was made from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician , who ruled the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( Pr@@ i ) , which ruled almost the whole century all political planes .
several pr@@ i @-@ g@@ ure were accused because of high @-@ quality cases of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ porter to write about previous inci@@ dents in this pub , including one where a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man went to a military attack .
only a few months before , the readers would have seen the column of Val@@ dez as the best informed source of kidn@@ apping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier we had already knew what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El FLACO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to its slim body stat@@ ure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication is broken with our sources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the office of Val@@ dez has been dedicated to the storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers , dedicated to the murder of journalists because the employees have become something that they have never expected : activists in the name of the press .
Re@@ por@@ ters Miri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez sn@@ aps up a few signs and went to a demonstration next morning to a demonstration for another journalist to the office of the Pro@@ sec@@ utor &apos;s office .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez was killed , in the western state of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA testing , that it is his .
throughout the country journalists have become more pressing , organized in organised protests &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; on walking and construction .
on that day the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is gone to Washington and tries to gather international support for the judiciary in the case of Val@@ dez .
in a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day following the murder of Val@@ dez Ram@@ i@@ rez de@@ comp@@ ose the authorities , journalists and bring them to leave because they said the truth .
she has since been asked to be once again divided by the government because it is worried that their anger has hurt their objectivity .
Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico organized by organised crime , who took part in government officials and a simultaneous society . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in his last book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nar@@ co journalist &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote that re@@ porter are not only killed by drug gangs but also on command of politicians and security forces , organised by organised crime under a ceiling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the media group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ulo 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; held last year more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico @-@ minded you , because they would like that you hold the mouth &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect .
nobody for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger in Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your body was found along with a note that was supposedly signed by the Z@@ etas @-@ Kart@@ ell : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a computer ta@@ stat@@ or and ear@@ phones are next to their separate head .
some stores have chosen to close the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern boundary of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua according to the assass@@ ination of the correspon@@ dents Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others make on how it did El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after the murder of their director in 2004 .
in 2010 the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ arez was directed publicly to the drug cart@@ els with a editorial theme at the title &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled from their native states or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile and they still watch the streets and seek dangers .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as it is apparently the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was killed in 2015 with four women in an apartment in Mexico @-@ town three months after escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who remain backward and continue the work , it is a daily dance with risky decisions .
I@@ barra , who wanted to be poet , gives to that the drug distribute it frigh@@ tened him .
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and so I became re@@ porter , &quot; he said .
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Rio@@ do@@ ce began on the side@@ walk before the office and drank beer when all their phones began to grow .
a series of sho@@ ot@@ ings with band@@ bed and security forces near the bathing resort Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war escal@@ ated , as promised by a series of Kart@@ ell messages in the region .
from the on @-@ board edge , they have published the news on the website of Rio@@ do@@ ce via mobile phone .
the front page had to be changed on the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens nearby - a further s@@ late in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez got a look at the polic@@ emen , the guards held to see if they were in readiness .
if they were afraid they did not show it .
under the powerful portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose Middle @-@ finger was visible for the whole of Sin@@ alo@@ a , followed the employees of Rio@@ do@@ ce followed his tracks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you only think about close , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when was mur@@ dered by Javier , the practic@@ ant asked me to send them to coverage on the streets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dinosau@@ rs use cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age to so@@ ak its enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , if a terri@@ fying thing .
now researchers have found that the first findings of the unbelievable Nas@@ horn of a Canadian Berg@@ worker were so well received that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa der dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so well preserved that they could even notice that his native skin was from red@@ dish &apos;s Braun - and they said they could have had something from a &quot; un@@ quiet past . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Current Biology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; described it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poss@@ essed dinosau@@ rs who ever was found and one of the best dinosau@@ rs in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fossil is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier who lived in the mid @-@ season between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
its incredibly well received state has researchers , who describe it as &quot; really remarkable . &quot;
according to reports in National Geo@@ graphic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant vor@@ es is best preserved in its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k , when he was in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alberta , Canada ,
he met something from the surrounding rock was lacking in the plat@@ ze , and decided to watch more accurately .
this discovered by him was sent to Royal T@@ yr@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to un@@ cover the wild beast within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy ris@@ kl@@ ets .
after all this hard work , the finished product is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you want to blin@@ king just a little with the eyes , you could almost believe it has slept , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal T@@ yr@@ rell Museum , where the creature has to be seen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will enter into the science of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosau@@ rs - Mon@@ a Lisa the dinosau@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
researchers have found that this plant @-@ e@@ ater is covered , although it is covered with a armor and a changing shell , probably of meat @-@ eating dinosau@@ rs .
the strongly ar@@ mor@@ ed dinosau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors and used a shi@@ el@@ ding technology known as counterparts that is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed to blend better in its surroundings and avoid its enemies , say experts , which indicates that it was threatened by bigger dinosau@@ rs .
the 110 million years old creature from the family of the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs took first head@@ lines in May and is now at the Royal T@@ yr@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and it is called Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta bran@@ ch@@ elli after the Muse@@ um@@ ste@@ el@@ ta Mark Mitch@@ ell , one of a team that has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours in it , it carefully expose .
the amazing preservation of the specimen was possible to document Dr. Mitch@@ ell and an international team of scientists , the patterns and the form of scales and arm@@ ours over his body .
they discovered the counter @-@ sh@@ aded , a widespread defensive method in animal @-@ rich , which means that the tip of the creature was dar@@ ker than its under@@ side .
although the counter @-@ sh@@ aded is common , the results are surprising since the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta is by far the animals living today .
it points out that the dinosau@@ rs was hun@@ ted by meat vor@@ tices dinosau@@ r dinosau@@ rs , evolution lies the wear of the confrontation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals that use the counter @-@ sh@@ aded - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or gir@@ d@@ animals - are much smaller and hur@@ ting than prey , which sign@@ aled that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real battle for survival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ ors @-@ behavior on a massive , strong ar@@ mor@@ ed dinosau@@ rs show how dangerous the dinosau@@ rs &apos;s car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es have been to have been , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their sc@@ als also shows that the skin of the dinosau@@ rs was red@@ dish brown .
scientists still examine the animal on references about his life , including his conc@@ ise loan to figure out what it has eaten as its last meal .
they believe that the dinosau@@ rs when he died , went out into a river and went out into the sea , where he sank on the back to the bottom .
at that time , Alberta were as warm as Süd@@ fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably even more widespread than they are today .
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preser@@ vatives &apos;s skin , but also kept in three dimensions and retains the original shape of the animal , &quot; said Brown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that the animal looks almost exactly as much as in the early season . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you do not need to use much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you just have a little with the eyes loop , you might almost believe that he is in sleep . &quot;
the chal@@ k time was a time when giant thermal , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous dinosau@@ rs arose on two legs on the earth .
though the king of them , the ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus rex , millions years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta lived , the ar@@ mor@@ ed dinosau@@ rs was hun@@ ted by some of his frigh@@ tening ancestors .
to this end the Acro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters .
the scientists , whose recent findings appear in the journal Current Biology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta was vers@@ ed after death in the sea and m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k , when he was in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alberta , Canada ,
according to the museum , it is the occupied dinosau@@ r of the world , including skin and arm@@ aments , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip .
the creatures were on average approximately 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and have weigh@@ ed up to 3.000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch @-@ long peaks that stem from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant vor@@ es was pushed by the western Canada , until a floo@@ ded river floo@@ ded into the open sea .
but the underwater illumination of the dinosau@@ rs preserved his armor in an exquisite detail .
the hidden rem@@ n@@ ants of this specific specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains still b@@ ump@@ y panels along the dinosau@@ rs
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko has written for National Geo@@ graphic , such a level of conservation is as &quot; rare as a profit in the lot@@ to .
the more I see , the more confusing it becomes .
hidden remains of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y armor plate , which carry the sk@@ ull of the animal .
his right front is on his side , his five fingers are split up .
I can count the scales on his sole &apos; .
in the thunder@@ storm : Mass@@ ac@@ aram@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many wounded
violent accident on Thursday night on the A@@ 8 : nearly 30 cars are processed in a mass ar@@ chery .
there are numerous wounded , long @-@ long st@@ ints - and G@@ aff@@ er .
at the Stuttgart @-@ Munich motorway ( A@@ 8 ) , on the late Thursday morning , some 20 people were wounded .
after the first information of the police were between 17.00 pm between the connection of Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district of Ai@@ ch@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm under 30 cars , including probably trucks , inter@@ connected .
about the exact number of wounded , first of all , no data is available .
it is easy to medium @-@ sized injury , said a pol@@ ze@@ is@@ pre@@ cher .
a large call on ambul@@ ance vehicles was at the in@@ genu@@ ity .
the A@@ 8 was fully locked in the direction of Munich .
in the sou@@ ther@@ ly direction of Munich it formed a ten @-@ kilometer way back .
like an A@@ Z @-@ Re@@ porter , it also came on the counter@@ way to massive disability - through numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire@@ men notes the characteristic of the vehicle body , which now have to be reck@@ oned with sensitive pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 and then there was a second accident on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a collision between an auto@@ ran@@ ate and a car .
a rescue @-@ helicopter was on the road to in@@ genu@@ ity .
Deutsche Bahn : group test@@ et &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced once : nothing ahn@@ end is sitting in the train and sleeps .
or you have desc@@ ended into his work and has just an in@@ geni@@ ous thought .
and then : pu@@ ff@@ f .
comes the Schaff@@ ner and awak@@ ens an uns@@ killed or set the passenger right in the middle of the workflow .
ticket control .
but times of inter@@ rup@@ tions are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn currently has the managed straight line control .
one simply confirms using mobile phone that you have taken up his seat and evalu@@ ates the ticket card .
currently there is a test run on two routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes the offer , expand it from . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is expected to be available in Germany in the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a train speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls the rail the ticket de@@ valu@@ ation without Schaff@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to be able to use , however , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to have an online ticket - what already most passengers do .
you also have to have purchased it via the app &apos;s app , the DB Navigator &apos;s app , which is the most convenient way of ticket bu@@ ck .
and finally , you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works so : you rise in the train , calling his ticket to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the test report then appears a button for electronic de@@ valu@@ ation .
the train companion get on their mobile devices a message that the g@@ ast X is located on the train and has taken the booked seat Y Y .
comes the train companion when travelling control to place Y , he knows that there is a passenger with already ent@@ less online ticket .
so one can continue to sleep , continue to be silent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has two advantages : one for the customers , one for the railway - which again is to use the passengers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; who can go relaxed without a ticket control by our train companion , check in the DB Navigator just yourself .
this enables the guests to make their travel time in the train , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing Director of DB correspondence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who often drives train , knows that besides delays and missed the ticket controls to the most of the times .
for often one does not have oneself in any case but one of the participants do not need any documents that you need for the recycling of online tickets .
either the credit card or the personnel card or otherwise a document you need to prove .
the result are endless discussions between traction companion and chassis , which leads to bad mood in the part or large area and delays in control of their own tickets and take the Schaff@@ ner at the end of time to take care of other concerns .
only a small number of test clients can use the new service .
and this only at the ICE ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
other train numbers on the same track are not yet released .
how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 , Brittany Fer@@ rell was sha@@ ken to their core .
just one day after being arrived in New York City , those in St. Louis sat on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment , which they rented and sc@@ rolling through Facebook on their phone .
she stum@@ bled upon a post by someone from High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police just have a 18 @-@ year child killed , and it is still on the road &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it meant there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused , as no one else had posted on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the manual @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly wor@@ shipped on her tim@@ eline .
the r@@ apper from the territory of St. Louis was , the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year old , who was killed by a white police officers in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , killed , live .
he posted an image of Brow@@ n@@ able body that was stretched out on the road and stay four hours there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rell was near himself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was for her and her community nothing new .
she placed her cell phone to return later on the evening to T@@ we@@ et over people on the Can@@ field Drive .
there were photos of the police band and people , the cried out , and by a man who claimed to be a sign with the wording : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ ons police have just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
they watched a live feed in which a polic@@ eman has stood before a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bell@@ ish dog .
in another video , she said , un@@ secured a different poli@@ z@@ ist his ri@@ f@@ le and cried : &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reminded Fer@@ rell &apos;s statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder that we have used to call ourselves and which we can call . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at this moment I felt sho@@ ok .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
they booked a flight back and went home next day .
after landing at 23 p.m. she took her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two would drive to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on next morning .
what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the cinem@@ as from 11 .
it is a history of survival and protest , of love and loss , strength and resistance , which consists of the point of view of the people living in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers .
as a Fer@@ rell with her daughter , who ran a cau@@ lif@@ table and a suitable crown , after F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two spoke a conversation that they had countless times in this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black condition . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember when I have taught yourself when black people have to fight for that which they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reminded them of what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now we go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police have killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that was not true . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I could not take them , &quot; said Fer@@ rell later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is happening today is a highlight of what happened in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they have to know and see it and be raised in it .
it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the different layers of the black experience and the black Constitution and what we need to do to freely deliver ourselves .
even though I have the luck to give you an experience in which they personally have no e@@ at@@ ant racism , it is not different from the next black women @-@ child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel I would prove her a bad service to keep away from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first stop when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on was on the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which became a Camp@@ site , when the activ@@ ist on the possible non @-@ indictment of Dar@@ ren Wilson waited .
there is Fer@@ rell and her daughter connected to a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared pockets before and hal@@ ted them to pass on demonstr@@ ators .
slowly began to take up a new kind of activ@@ ism for Fer@@ rell &apos;s shape .
&quot; my activ@@ ism has changed after 9 August , &quot; she said and notices that she was as a student at the University of Mis@@ souri @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black congregations .
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it is all come . &quot;
weeks later Fer@@ rell met in an evening @-@ demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ director of the film .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said , she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted to just document &quot; document &quot; what happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a question came to Fer@@ rell in the sense : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you document or tries to find a story that you can use ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished through countless cases of people , often of wh@@ ites in a community that benef@@ ited from their pain and their resistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as fo@@ ay@@ an recently explained in an interview : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had heard that people who were born in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on and grew up , their voices are not centered and we wanted to do it differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the then Co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the field , which is known for his activ@@ ism to to@@ dest@@ ra@@ k in@@ mates .
his involvement brought forth Fer@@ rell the project closer , along with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after browsing .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us . we speak &quot; says Davis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was the main thing for me , how these people will be represented , for so will I be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to concentrate on Ferr@@ ell &apos;s experience - to show that it is in the movement &quot; not a Messiah leader , but to a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it proved to be the most obvious number of participants in the film .
consequently , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Ferr@@ ell &apos;s life , as she loves himself and mar@@ ries their wife .
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed as they saw the finished product for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have understood that there must be a certain accus@@ ation in this work and at the rev@@ ital@@ isation of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Ferr@@ ab@@ ell &apos;s history is the role of the black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter Movement .
two of the three founders of the movement , which after the killing of the black teen@@ ager Martin in 2012 have shaped the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black@@ li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in social media in 2012 , identify themselves as gay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have borne the movement in total , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; and therefore we are fighting on different fronts .
black , gay women must carry the main load of everything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an atmospheric to notice that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement really is kept by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a affir@@ mati@@ ver type of action , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Fer@@ rell was chosen as a heart of film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she was the person who stir@@ red this energy , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s no coincidence , although it was on the front line because with a life on these crosses as a black , gay woman is so much at stake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
now , the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long gone , but the rac@@ ist connections between the community and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rell is at local currency for 2 ½ years because of the block@@ age of a highway during a demonstration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it describes the social policy atmosphere of the area that they call their home : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a mess &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless she cl@@ oned a voc@@ als and she feels obliged to this memory , since she passed over three years ago in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we must love and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to scale &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : TV reader to discuss about bit gallery
the Bit Gallery moves people , although it is not yet built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre at the south @-@ end of the pedestrian zone spl@@ its since the first presentation 2009 the population in supporters and opponents .
cold can hardly be one of the subject .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also on our Facebook page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; People &apos;s and Bit@@ burg &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will be discussed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; while the one to the bit Galerie say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would be a dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not need a human &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi benches ) or quite simple : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; size w@@ ahn ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while supporters build that a gallery draws more customers to the city , of which the other stores will benefit , fear the opponents , that then the pedestrian prec@@ inct .
added to the gallery is planned exactly on the property where the peasant market hall is where the 13 direct market will offer its products .
with the start of construction work will be an end .
the gallery M@@ acher want to integrate a mark@@ hall in the new building - in addition to Bed@@ a @-@ place with possibility of sitting outside .
Simone Rooms : &quot; we have been buying almost weekly in the peasant hall for many years .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the farmers always like to be very happy .
also the but@@ cher we discovered for us .
we would like to see that during and above all , after building the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also .
especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Ger@@ d D@@ ensing : &quot; whether to market a market in a market hall in the gallery , comes to the height of the rent .
this is likely not likely to be low in the new project . &quot;
Eva Kili@@ c : &quot; what shopping an@@ thing in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I find that superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there is already enough of this in our city .
you can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .
but since there is not even a proper weekend &apos;s market here , it is all the more important that we have at least get the Mark@@ thalle .
after all , the goods offered there is fresh , is mostly offered directly from the producer and is ob@@ fin@@ ely inexpensive .
as you can see , shops are rented in a shopping center only by larger companies , because the dor@@ man@@ sions are often not portable for a retailer .
too bad , special stores there is almost no more and what still exists , then probably will disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping mall with a market hall is not suitable for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
especially : where is the peasant market during the construction period ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit @-@ gallery is actually coming .
or does it create the spec@@ tro@@ st bit @-@ gallery before , to drive all shops from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; that will simply not work .
and a shopping center that is empty , no one needs .
in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real peasant market rather than this gallery .
but for a peasant market , it will give thanks to the an@@ sel@@ ess many - as I find - meaning@@ less construction projects in Bit@@ burg no place more .
when the peasant market is broken , a piece of culture will disappear . &quot;
a suitable simil@@ arity : artist creates portrait with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
in the middle of the space of Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which are almost in@@ strange - that hang on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Tu@@ pf@@ ers and Hair sec@@ ular , who were sent to her from Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent out the excer@@ pts from prison in Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former intelligence service analy@@ st had a 35 @-@ year imprisonment , after they made publicly conc@@ il@@ ted diplomatic messages about the Wi@@ ki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition , which was opened on 2 August is called A incoming resem@@ b@@ lance ( a suitable simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg who united their expertise in technology , computer sciences and arts , and Mann@@ ing , a Trans@@ wife and pioneering Dis@@ cipl@@ ed , whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has created by the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA , which could be extracted from the 30 portraits , as someone could look like with this gen@@ om@@ ic data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the in@@ consistency determin@@ ants of these interpre@@ tations - but also for identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but already since her pu@@ ber@@ ty has spoken openly about the identification as a woman , has been sentenced in 2013 for 20 accus@@ ations , including six violations of the Spi@@ on@@ age@@ Act , computer and theft .
because of the prison its picture was oppressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gran@@ ular , black @-@ white Sel@@ f@@ ie , in the Mann@@ ing is visi@@ bly un@@ argu@@ ably at a driver &apos;s seat and a plat@@ in@@ blonde Per@@ m carries - with which it was associated .
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was just coming from the great success of their 2012 @-@ project &apos; stran@@ ger &apos; .
therein , the artist portra@@ ys portraits of stran@@ for@@ ic arti@@ facts like cig@@ ar mu@@ te and chew@@ ing g@@ um by extract the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people could look like .
that was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing , while she was in prison and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg near the new exhibition .
and she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed , so she took contact with Chelsea , and asked if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and their det@@ ain@@ ted m@@ use were too un@@ equal pen@@ pal , which were inter@@ changeable over two years in the course of two years .
they even created one of Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o Illu@@ stri@@ fied Com@@ ic &quot; Supp@@ res@@ sed Images , &quot; which would like to convert a future that would be the President Ch@@ lo@@ as judgment and it would be able to see the exhibition personally .
that Obama was indeed only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing release was calling for seven brutal years to a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as , was a welcome way of happy @-@ meeting .
there is also now at the opening of the exhibition something deep and Star@@ kes , since Donald Tru@@ mp will take a war against inform@@ ants from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops in order to find new , twe@@ et@@ ently ways to remedy the stra@@ ining divisions which he actually should fix .
as De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg after the strange timing of all these things was asked , she said that &quot; things happen from a certain reason . &quot;
in a written artistic statement called on the wall of the gallery , cre@@ ing with their over@@ sized signature below ( the &quot; i &quot; in their sur@@ name is provided with a heart ) an end to the automatic frag@@ mentation , whose basis was gender , race , sexuality and culture . &quot;
the opposite wall is their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thousands of C and GS and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show through the inclusion of 200 letters ( or Nu@@ cl@@ o@@ ti@@ des after the highly @-@ developed scientific dictionary of the artist ) , as surprisingly similar , at least in biological regards , we all are .
&quot; what people will hopefully bring about is that our gen@@ ome is not taking care of who we are and how openly genetic data are for an interpretation and as subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , also to be seen .
&quot; DNA &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , therefore the 30 of these stories are &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room is a page from the above mentioned Com@@ ic @-@ Nov@@ elle .
it shows cre@@ ing as they pl@@ unge in hand from the discipl@@ in@@ arctic in hand from the discipl@@ in@@ ark@@ as@@ terns of the United States as King @-@ Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they address your speech , then they won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , never stop the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter that she wrote me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist , who greet from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still get ge@@ ese when I talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not yet seen the exhibition - just as it was supposed to be taken away in the Com@@ ic@@ book - but if they should do it , then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic sim@@ ul@@ ls who summar@@ ize as hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
that was also focused on how everything was written in the exhibition until the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing ) , in which their genetic p@@ ap@@ log@@ groups were written with a pencil .
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted it to feel like a crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg of the portraits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement , which is also hidden behind their liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of the University of North@@ western and a cler@@ k of the University of Oxford because of kill@@ ings
a nationwide crowd @-@ hunting is in progress for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford that have been sought as susp@@ ects after a man had been killed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injury .
on Monday were exhibited for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ t because of their alleged participation in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , such as the acts of counter@@ part of Cook County .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , after several stit@@ ches died .
one of the police authority of Chicago published a collaborative warning system , that the ly@@ re was discovered on July 27 .
officials received a call , came at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries at his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared on the site of the event for dead , and det@@ ective examine the stal@@ ks as murder , while the police are actively seeking the two susp@@ ects , said officials .
La@@ them has been an extraordinary Professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at North@@ western University since 2007 .
Alan K. Cub@@ i , the Vice President for University relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ ws has now been eliminated in evaluated and ruled by the entering of the North@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal case that is studied by the competent authorities and the North@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford .
a spokes@@ man of the university and the Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; we are in contact with the police in Great Britain and are ready to help the US investig@@ ators in every conceivable manner . &quot;
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens colleagues were sho@@ cked and want to himself .
Chief Communications Officer of the Police authority of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , he calls for susp@@ ects the susp@@ ects to face the authorities .
&quot; the police have a conception of their residence , and our efforts to locate them , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building car@@ et@@ akers of the Grand Plaza building who had just received a pu@@ zz@@ ling tip , the said that in apartment 10@@ 08 was something happened .
the police described the scene as very cru@@ el .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27th .
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ them and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the management team of Grand Plaza published a statement to the residents : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the offering , and explores a variety of moti@@ fs , including a possible domestic incident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we will conclude the W@@ ada &apos;s roadmap in the near future &quot; - the Russian vi@@ ep@@ re@@ mi@@ er Mut@@ ko
the Russian vi@@ ep@@ re@@ mi@@ er Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t take long before the remaining criteria of the world @-@ anti @-@ doping agency ( W@@ ada ) to restore the Russian anti @-@ doping agency ( R@@ USA@@ DA ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at a certain stage of fulfilling the criteria of the roadmap , R@@ USA@@ DA has received the right to plan and test in collaboration with UK@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ doping ) .
the W@@ ada @-@ roadmap was updated in this respect , &quot; explained Mut@@ ko on Thursday .
the PM commented on the second part of the roadmap of the W@@ ada to comply with the code which describes the criteria for res@@ idency of R@@ USA@@ DA and recently published on the organization &apos;s website .
according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could give rise to Russia .
&quot; everything has been announced , everything is implemented .
and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and W@@ ada in the near future , &quot; he added .
one of the criteria named according to the criteria , however , stated that the Russian anti @-@ doping authorities have to publicly accept the findings of the W@@ ada approved investigation by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren in the state of state @-@ funded PhD in Russian sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in relation to the matter , Mut@@ ko : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation by , since our anti @-@ doping system has collap@@ sed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no state programmes , and we will not admit something that does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mut@@ ated words were agreed with those of Vit@@ aly S@@ mir@@ nov , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ doping Commission .
talking to the Russian sales location R@@ sport at the beginning of the day , S@@ mir@@ nov gave problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ doping organizations , then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody has to accept this report un@@ condi@@ tionally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added S@@ mir@@ nov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
R@@ USA@@ DA was excluded in November 2015 in the course of the doping sc@@ and@@ als from the W@@ ada of the implementation of D@@ op@@ ing@@ controls in Russia .
however , you have been allowed to plan and coordinate test under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ doping ( UK@@ AD ) .
after a visit to the capital of the organization in Moscow in July , W@@ ada @-@ Director @-@ General Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli that R@@ USA@@ DA is &quot; moving &quot; in the right direction . &quot;

Amy Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure the luck with your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the surveys did not work .
answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful or - worse - frau@@ dul@@ ently .
and even if you desp@@ ised anonym@@ ity , some workers mour@@ ned the process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was simply never consistency and objectivity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ commerce Hair Care Society Ma@@ dison Reed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has been people from the outside by means of help .
a new race of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is ongoing , to help companies find out how their employees feel .
by creating and licensing of software , which has the specific purpose of measuring the employee involvement , it allows companies to address surveys , special groups and demo@@ graphic groups , provide employees anonym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ n allowing the C @-@ suite managers to handle and contact the Board of Directors .

companies come to see that at the head of the workplace culture will have to stay , so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber who has been implic@@ ated in Sk@@ and@@ ale since then a former employee has published a blog post in which those who have spoken , pun@@ ished .
for start @-@ ups like G@@ lin@@ t , this desire for an overview is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business possibility .
global governance , regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18,@@ 7 billion in 2020 , following the budget@@ ary website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Conver@@ tible , the company helps to prevent bad behavior and to recognize , saw a rising interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the midst of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ all in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
Conver@@ cent has almost 600 clients , including air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
u@@ ber recently signed up as a client .
as G@@ lin@@ t , Conver@@ tible companies can send custom @-@ made &quot; Pul@@ s &quot; Surv@@ eys , trust confidential answers in real time and view the warmth @-@ maps of your problem .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hotline , with the staff of bad behavior .
and if the main business guide is included , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court of public opinion has captured the regul@@ ators &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Conver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a company is found that his staff is poorly treated or beha@@ ves un@@ ethical , it can experience good consequences through consumers of boy@@ cott , employee fluctu@@ ation and law@@ suits , &quot; Qu@@ in@@ lan .
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant @-@ chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites , convertible has been used for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of the policy and procedures and have a simple way to achieve their company headquarters .
earlier , if a employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company central , to submit a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously .
it was often a intim@@ id@@ ation and in@@ convenient experience , James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Coun@@ sel , who said , there was no good way to follow the complaints of employees .
now that the company uses Conver@@ ters , can problems , which were previously hidden by managers , who were previously hidden in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or incomplete internship - quickly identified and addressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view in experience with employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who leads the risk management Group from Ruby Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; employment law &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies began to harvest ethics , values and employee engagement in 2002 after the accounting company Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed because of eth@@ ic violations by the En@@ ron @-@ Sk@@ andal said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
but it lasted until the &quot; Social Media came to their right &quot; that companies recognised that you could not prevent their dirty laundry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using technology for the monitoring of ethics , people used hope as a strategy &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ cent offer your software as a service and recei@@ vable the companies with recur@@ rent fees for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance that finds the consent of Venture Capital Invest@@ ors , which have supported both start@@ ups .
Conver@@ ters received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Ventures and T@@ ola Capital , which was raised the total capital to $ 47 million .
gl@@ itz@@ s secured up $ 10 million in November by Bes@@ se@@ mer Venture Partners and brought its entire financing to $ 60 million .
these investments make hardly surprising , given the networked nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more from their jobs than before .
in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley are high sal@@ aries and interesting projects only inserts .
the employees want the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to feel in a company that is worth their voices , and that work that you do is worthwhile , then they feel more strongly committed to make this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience in Linked@@ In , which uses both Conver@@ ters and G@@ lin@@ t .
investors gain Ren@@ di@@ ten if their portfolio companies are well @-@ running . businesses run well when employees are campa@@ ign@@ ing and engaging .
if the analytics tools of third party promise , commitment and commitment to increase employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data about the employee involvement according to the experts of the workplace culture is important .
but the data are useless if the administrator of a company cannot take action .
in fact , if a company asks employees after your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way .
and if the shift does not come quickly enough , or not at all , this can grow dis@@ appointments and employees .
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be ready to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies to rely on collecting data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you do not follow the staff will ask themselves &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about it ?
and if you don &apos;t care about why should I ? &quot;
Ma@@ dison Reed , who now carries Monthly employee pol@@ ls , was able to initiate measures on the same day if a problem is reported on G@@ lin@@ t , so ret@@ ret@@ t .
and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , she was able to organize new teams working within the company by the speed of decision @-@ making and the quality of communication , capable of organizing several teams working within the company and to add a communication training to tackle the problems .
with Ruby Tuesday , the company always receives new insights on the employees , and it hopes that in the long run , this leads to a better bond of workers in an industry that is known for high revenues .
&quot; if you are not obligated to create a culture of transparency , you will lose human beings , &quot; said Vit@@ rano .
&quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers .
and if you lose customer , you will lose companies .
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates two @-@ days practices and makes a long day for the brood @-@ ins
it is on 23 o &apos;clock as a lot of U@@ CL@@ A footprint on one side of the new exercises of the team on the campus are talking .
some have moved their tri@@ oto@@ c parts and show the back full of swe@@ at from the first day of the workout .
for a good part of the team these in@@ active minutes constitute a lunch break .
players who are written to the summer@@ time are after the three @-@ hour practice return to their final examination before they return next morning at 6 : 30 to the Water@@ man Football Center .
&quot; that &apos;s for the boys the next three days a real treadmill , &quot; said Bru@@ ck @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a short before Monday to Tuesday .
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminated two @-@ days exercises to facilitate the weight of players and it has actually extended their days - at least until the finale at Friday .
therefore the first three trainings of U@@ CL@@ A should start at 19 : 15 in order to meet the already packed time@@ outs of players already .
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the brood is moved almost one week after the last season and during the summer school during the summer school during the first time during the summer school during the first time during the summer school during the summer school during the summer school .
during the course of August 18 exercises , they are supposed to hold 18 exercises . 20 before the start of formal game preparations for its pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he support the control change of N@@ CA@@ A , even if they add a more busy routes to the player a further point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put these enormous burden three or four days on it and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they simply pushed it down , they plac@@ ements on , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think once we come until Saturday and we have more time , it will really be great . &quot;
the U@@ CL@@ A will finish its practices as soon as the camp is finished , resulting in the light of its fields of an adjacent parking place and the adjoining L@@ kin Center , a hotel of up@@ scale class that was already mounted with foot@@ wear , which will be a protective net behind a tor@@ ped@@ o @-@ pole , no easy task .
brood @-@ players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a adm@@ its that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far @-@ fet@@ ched to think that people can rent a room there and then set up a practice .
if you have the video of a exercise , it is a rather good deal .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
therefore , I have not been doing too big concerns .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensify facts in the fight against counterf@@ eit news
Facebook wishes to send more potential articles with false messages from third parties and then show their results under the original contribution , the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News .
the company said in an opinion on his website that it is started using the use of updated machines to identify possible false messages and to send them to the fact@@ sheet , which may display results of the fac@@ ten@@ ders from the original article .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the so @-@ called F@@ ake news , many of which believe that they also influenced the U.S. presidential election in 2016 .
the problem has also become a major political issue where the French voters were floo@@ ded in May with false stories , and Germany will support a plan according to social media networks , if they don &apos;t manage to eliminate h@@ ew@@ n post@@ ings as before the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate explanation in German , that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany will start a test of the new facts .
&quot; in addition to knowledge , which stories of fact @-@ tested third parties are challenged , people want to make more context in order to make sound decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara S@@ u , Product man@@ ag@@ ger for Facebook News in a blog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook will continue to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; testing the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; link &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and works on other changes to his post @-@ feed to reduce false messages . &quot; &quot; &quot;
creating a Com@@ ic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his recent past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ ang@@ hole for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in 1970 @-@ 1980 and 1980 @-@ 2000 .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history in the Be@@ w@@ l River valley in K@@ ent and is now back for inspiration for a graphical novel by Jamie Rhodes , a m@@ op@@ ha@@ ired Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ one with a preference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I find it so nice to look at the manuscript by someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says we@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand . &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos;@@ um@@ eric the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documented the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another , upcoming British artist - Isaac Tur@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Is@@ abel Green@@ berg .
it is not the first book by Rhodes , which is based on an archive : he wrote 2014 &apos;@@ Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he un@@ expect@@ edly found emotional .
&quot; I have only responded to the thumb@@ nail on the side of a letter so that one was written by a double ag@@ enten in the 1700 &apos;s years , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is his durability ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
and letters always smells of smoke , because at that time they lit a fire because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he was himself .
Oh , I love Archive ! &quot;
for someone who has be@@ aten so with old papers that he lived by National Trust and the Arts Council England ( &quot; To be honest : I got my welcome at a little &apos; ) , this seems to be all too beautiful to be true .
Rho@@ dos spent his days to explore the vi@@ kt@@ ori@@ anic &quot; new &quot; castle to watch the archives and study the many treasures and curiosity of the castle , like the mon@@ oc@@ ate hy@@ ena heads at walls and bottles , the centuries spent in the dit@@ ch .
he wander@@ ed through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with Land@@ s@@ uns , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
then , at night he drank &apos; whis@@ key and started to write . &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown because the National Trust was only granted full access in 2006 than the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rhodes arrived a decade later , the employees began to take care of the archive which he had as &quot; hundreds of years , in which ari@@ sto@@ cr@@ ats said &quot; Oh , take it on the loft .
&quot; &quot; &quot; di@@ aries , letters from the time of English Emp@@ ires , maps that represent something which poss@@ essed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you could think that country fli@@ ts would be boring , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rhodes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was a pe@@ ar to have fought the two families . &quot; &quot; &quot;
guys , let all go its gear ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse on the wider base in the English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which leaves a man who rel@@ ies the newly built castle in order to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of a tur@@ mo@@ il that stood in 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book with the title &apos; Kni@@ gh@@ tly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , says Rhodes .
&quot; the peasant uprising in this area began and I thought an insurrection was a good beginning .
maybe the two are connected ? &quot;
other stories are rooted in the history of the palace - as &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the history of the Jesu@@ it , who hid the family Dar@@ rell seven years throughout the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , in which the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rell is represented in the 18th century , who filled his own fun@@ eral , filled a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was taken only years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) .
the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rhodes &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gentlemen seemed to be just over and over time and spending money for things they could not afford .
other generations of Dar@@ rell @-@ men sol@@ dered their debt crisis by married old women - I imagine it as a bunch of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to advertise fatigue . &quot;
after the end of his engagement in the castle , Rhodes is looking for other unique scre@@ aming experiences
he has brought a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a com@@ ic @-@ novel about El@@ sh@@ ame@@ mo@@ ki , the grounds of a san@@ atorium of the early 20th century , which has since been called back by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; says he .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to finish again with the dam@@ n lives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the sle@@ eves of the 3@@ 01 year old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the city of Bad Honnef on Friday has started its campaign to introduce a new roof brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) .
until Thursday , Mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team will hold Nelson Art@@ z the logo and the slogan .
at the end of August it will be the highlight of the campaign to give a festival on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; too nice for us .
or ? , &quot; ask the creators of the action since yesterday on the poster at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer chapel .
&quot; we think that ( obviously ! ) not really , &quot; write them on their last activated website .
&quot; but we use this measure to gain your attention .
and to make it clear that some is better than it seems .
in essence , we firmly believe that we as Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer citizens know the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city very well . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in action I go to more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one logo and a slogan , it means further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true to form@@ ulate a self @-@ standing promise , one that gives the city an unmistak@@ able single appearance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally , they stand in the competition with other municipalities .
a mid @-@ digit amount is the city of Bad Honnef its new roof brand and the campaign cost .
military forms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan fear of the army
every year at the beginning of August advis@@ es in Ankara of the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) about pen@@ sion@@ ing and carriage on the officer Cor@@ ps .
so also this week .
at first sight a normal operation .
but nothing is routine in the Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt .
the meeting no longer took place in the building of the General Staff , as previously , but in the office seat of the Prime Minister .
at the presidency of the heads of state , the five dep@@ uty leader and the minister of defense , home affairs , justice and foreign countries .
therewith , the civilians were in the Y@@ as in the survivors .
the government is moving the breeding in the military .
general Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the comm@@ anders of the He@@ eres , the air@@ forces and the n@@ avy were dis@@ missed .
since the coup Cou@@ p has state Erdo@@ gan 169 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and the Admir@@ als .
over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged links to the movement of the exile @-@ Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , the Erdo@@ gan as a ro@@ ht@@ ar of the coup .
against 4@@ 86 people who have been directly involved in the put@@ sch section , will be negotiated in Ankara for this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had the overthrow of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worship &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as he give him the opportunity to puri@@ fy the armed forces &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but has Erdo@@ gan the army really under control ?
at the end of February the newspaper &quot; hur@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article entitled &quot; Un@@ hairy in the military headquarters . &quot;
in the general bar , it concerns concerns because of an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which among other things expressed in the abolition of the head@@ tu@@ ch@@ ban for Sol@@ dat@@ ors , wrote the newspaper .
the great clean@@ se in the army and the security forces goes on any way .
in the middle of July Erdo@@ gan sent by decre@@ e another 73@@ 95 citizen , including 2@@ 303 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed like Erdo@@ gan the military .
the gener@@ als are formerly known as the actual masters of the country .
three times , they played by calling on their role as a gu@@ ardian of the world@@ ly state order .
following his election victory in 2002 Erdo@@ gan now pushed the power of the military step by step , not least by calling on the reform of the European Union .
former officers , Erdo@@ gan &apos;s target@@ ing a Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an especially @-@ called officer , who sought to seek asylum from fear of persecution abroad , the Turkish army will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full of extremi@@ sts and sal@@ af@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
meets this , such development could not be cold .
in any case , there is doubt in the alliance according to the cleansing of the Turkish army .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the management structures and operational capabilities be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weak@@ ened &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changing the rules for the Green Card
there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of Green Card , said President Donald Tru@@ mp , cited by the media .
he sees above to reduce the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stri@@ c@@ ter rules for obtaining visa for a temporary work permit and restrictions on family @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by the re@@ public@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill plan is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will decrease poverty , save wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers and will do this by adding the way to citizens from other countries of Green Cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent the chains of chains and replace the current system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this new review procedure will benefit the candidate who have the funds to support themselves and show knowledge which will benefit our economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; stated by the American media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ministry wants to furn@@ ish route for racing and aer@@ osp@@ ace
over the past few months , over the future of the race track has been progres@@ sed - now it &apos;s going to go very quickly .
even before the end of the year , on the mar@@ o@@ fold route , on which the tourist cable drives , will be built .
to secure the future of the racing price in the long run , according to the German Ministry of Traffic , the German Ministry of Finance shall begin to begin on the track .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to continue to order and sanc@@ tify the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Racing Sty@@ les , the country is mainly known for tourism &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; stated traffic state Secretary Klaus Sü@@ hl on Friday in Erfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost of maintenance of the route comprises approximately 2.5 million euros .
this sum of the sum of 75 per cent take over the country 75 per cent .
the contract , on whose basis the shuttle is to be ordered in the future of the country , it is currently concl@@ usive , explained Sü@@ hl .
the Ministry and the South @-@ ür@@ ing Bahn as the operator are already agreed upon the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means the roadmap to use the vehicles and quality standards , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sü@@ hl . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the rail society will be closed for a duration of eleven years .
to ensure that the racing starter shuttle on December 2017 will be regular .
the race track is one of all the popular rail links between the train stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ br@@ y .
in the course of a pilot business , the track has been tested by sufficient many people to reg@@ ain it again in the future .
the route is also partly strong in parts .
the rise of sex robot is real and we should worry
just as you thought it could not be any more crazy , a new report on technological developments in the area of sex robots .
yes , actually .
sex @-@ robots are currently a great thing .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robot in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , em@@ eri@@ ti@@ zed professor for Robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we have to begin to take its climb seriously .
customers can choose the eye @-@ color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of fingers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people make themselves funny , but the companies deliver lots of it and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Shar@@ key in the publication of his new report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern s@@ lab@@ ia have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robo@@ tic with a si@@ licon , which feels warm - with conscious human reactions , which are achieved by artificial intelligence .
the user can adapt its robot accordingly to its beliefs &quot; and choose everything from the eye @-@ color of the robot over the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or colour of his fingers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is still disturbing , as many robots possess the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which would make a step@@ ford @-@ woman progressive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern s@@ lab@@ ia have developed to robots with a si@@ licon .
the real Bo@@ ti@@ x robot allows for example its users to adapt their robots to the properties which they are appealing , such as rel@@ ent@@ ness .
and then there is still the Ro@@ und@@ x@@ xy Gold Sex @-@ robot with pre @-@ programmed personalities like &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which convey@@ s the impression of rel@@ ent@@ ness and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as good as possible , &quot; war@@ ms the website of True Comp@@ ani@@ on .
so you like what you like , and they don &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
in the course of the day they also have their mo@@ ods - just like true people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; it can be tired , be fixed on conversation or she can be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in mood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many disturbing aspects associated with this rise of sex robot - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the under@@ stretched female characteristics , the play@@ ability on rape as one is taking a step at Fri@@ gi@@ d ( is here : resist@@ ing ) Far@@ rah also goes on most .
on his website is True Comp@@ ani@@ on Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then have no Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy ? &quot; is it on the site .
however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just a different sex vehicle .
their origin and increasing refinement instru@@ ct a little dar@@ ker and deeper understanding in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for having sex with sub@@ ju@@ g@@ ation as an optional addition .
most men will of course maintain no sex robot , and while the FR@@ R re@@ marked its growing popularity , they still remain provisional at the edge of consumer culture .
but what le@@ ased out of the edge @-@ regions , can be in relation to the spirit of time in which we live , very instru@@ ctive .
and many people are not strange or offensive until they give permission to the free market .
there is still a certain over@@ cut that these highly developed sex robots in a time emerge when the rights of women are threatened around the world in which there is a president in the White House who have gr@@ asp@@ ed to have women sexually attacked .
the ab@@ hor@@ rid aspect of the TV series &quot; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &quot; ( &apos; The Report of the Mag@@ d &apos; ) are not the graphical images that im@@ pe@@ eled body and the spread @-@ wise eyes , but how realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a jump , but in the moment this does not feel like a great leap .
the target behind these sex robot is to make a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( if also with Por@@ no@@ star @-@ proportions ) .
their builders want to feel human and that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but , brought to the point when it comes to its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the robots represent no real women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they cannot be separate from their companion or just let go away .
they have no mediation or a background story , nothing that indicates on independence or anything , which might distur@@ b the imagination of total submission .
in other words , you are fake slaves .
or to express it in the wis@@ s of 2017 : maid
tru@@ mp@@ s high performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney for the ep@@ it@@ ome of the healthy human mind
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has become a bin@@ sen@@ ess of the Tru@@ mp era that political divisions that have pol@@ ari@@ zed the U.S. voters , even families in small format . &quot; &quot; &quot;
around Christmas and appointments fixed in the USA newspapers with advice on how to Cho@@ ose with the horror of Tru@@ mp Co@@ ating relatives .
we all said to us all alle@@ ge@@ dly to burst out our filtering .
less noticed is the power of Tru@@ mp@@ s , families together .
I chose this because my cous@@ ine , a left @-@ made poet who lives in Chicago and has long lived with the re@@ public@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York .
she reminded me that the unity of a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with Tru@@ mp in the White House , everyone who knows them , including the republi@@ can kin@@ ship , who fought them for decades due to politics , suddenly and quite odd on the same side .
to the dining table this is certainly a good thing , but it also falls in a wider context that this will also bring considerable risks with them .
the left was strengthened by Tru@@ mp , but the eff@@ lu@@ cent effect of his presidency has the strength to push us all right .
when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and Tru@@ mp , we refer to the gr@@ ati@@ fying opportunity for us to b@@ ail his m@@ b of a day no more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , there is still a rainy @-@ time scenario , in the Tru@@ mp Re@@ public@@ ans of the right wing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; norm@@ alized &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which suddenly appears in comparison to his standards as an ep@@ it@@ ome of denial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I find myself nowadays surrounded by an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s Com@@ bat version of the release - the dog on the auto @-@ roof , which saw 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return ) - which occur both compared to Tru@@ mp in fact a very mild crimes .
if Tru@@ mp goes , the next candidate of the Republi@@ can only be spirit@@ ually healthy to qualify themselves as unwanted improvement .
when my cous@@ in was in the city , we brought our children to car@@ ou@@ sel in Central Park , the largest of the car@@ ou@@ sel of New York Park@@ department , and the best three dollars that one can spend in the city when there is no caffeine .
the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are scar@@ red and the animals turn around to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the kli@@ sts music convey@@ s this in a strange way .
so many Kl@@ is@@ che@@ es of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of high buildings are old , the sky@@ lines become familiar to give much excitement and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream .
five @-@ five years later , and I am still not quite different from the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss Cottage - the subject @-@ pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not one - but a big roundabout in the north of London .
but the Central Park @-@ Kar@@ ou@@ sel is still a wei@@ rd magic experience , since here two two years old , a 11 @-@ year old and two women in the 40 @-@ years can go and all have a great time .
if I could evaluate the car@@ ou@@ sel , I would have given him the full scores , but fortunately nobody asked it afterwards .
on the other hand , I was obliged to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could get my credit card through .
in the coffee house at the corner of my road it is the same plus the option to buy the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter .
this does not only lead to a slow@@ ing of what actually should be a neutral exchange , but also exercises pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no need is necessary .
the poor wife at the department store was exc@@ es@@ ome , while I tired the experience made to submit their credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pi@@ stor@@ ius with breast canc@@ ers moved from the prison to hospital
Pi@@ stor@@ ius has left the prison for a hospital visit .
last year he was brought into hospital because of the treatment of cuts in his w@@ rists , which he suffered the pr@@ isons according to a case in his cell .
Pi@@ stor@@ ius was condemned by the first appeal of the prosec@@ ut@@ ors to a appeal to the prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
he sle@@ w Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early hours of Valent@@ ine &apos;s early hours by opening them several times by a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ tor@@ ia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pi@@ stor@@ ius &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pi@@ stor@@ ius said that he held his girlfriend for a closer intru@@ der that hidden in the cabin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ sec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six @-@ year prison sentence of Pi@@ stor@@ ius appeal , from which they say , be too indul@@ gent .
the National prosecution authorities said that they will rise to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the objection could be heard this year .
Pi@@ stor@@ ius runs danger that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there are no death penalty in South Africa .
as Bauer Arnold a strange egg can be found
as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the neighborhoods from Fü@@ tzen and E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen were released into the holidays and the secondary schools .
three of the Ent@@ le@@ ass@@ mates in the future go to gram@@ mar school , four to the real school .
Schul@@ te Angel@@ ica Sit@@ te , enter@@ tained the parents and representatives of the public in the bourgeois house Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen .
the 29 students of the four classes chose the 29 students of the four classes under the direction of Sophia Schu@@ macher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ des a young eagle , who grows in the chicken , but then released into freedom .
to this end , the m@@ lower Sch@@ ar led a musical with the title &quot; The Eagle in the Chi@@ n@@ erhof . &quot;
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg , and caused it to bro@@ ods from his chickens .
instead of a chicken , a small eagle came out .
yet the hope to make from him a chicken sm@@ ashed , the Eagle spread out on a high mountain its wings and escaped .
then the classes showed three and four in the assembly of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dance .
the h@@ ens d@@ anced with the young goat , the cylin@@ ders bore to the bet .
the Eagle stands for the integration , she said Schul@@ te Angel@@ ika .
the young is different from the other young animals ( ch@@ icks ) , but belonging to it .
he will never be like a chicken .
his purpose is to be free .
she wished every neighborhoods that he feels accepted in his new school .
there were Dan@@ ger@@ word to the colleagues , the former school manager Michael Müller , who will always jump over again at under@@ p@@ es@@ thesia , and the parents representatives .
the ch@@ illed season is now over , said class teacher Sophia Schu@@ macher .
they are leaving their students after two years of teaching only very odd , because it had been a really great time .
finally , it is possible to rely on the quarters of the neighborhoods .
to the end all students end a song of summer time and holiday season .
with the children the children broke out great joy .
for the new school year eight el@@ ic@@ äss@@ ler are already registered .

on the morning of August 1 in Si@@ th@@ onia , the police were arrested by the police a group of illegal people , including the two Bulg@@ arians .
on the same day they were released while currently a study is running .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported that the Bulg@@ arians were released later .
the Greek authorities have exac@@ erb@@ ated the control of the free camps and place anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose , to have significant funds .

software update for diesel vehicles : what people need to know now
how exactly is the software update instead of ?
must diesel drivers participate in the action ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
at the Diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group have offered software updates for a total of about 5,@@ 3 million cars .
they are supposed to improve the gas @-@ behavior of vehicles of the emissions classes in 5 and partly Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 Diesel or worse are exemp@@ t from it .
An@@ ja S@@ met@@ an@@ in by the ACE Auto Club Europe offers assess@@ ments :
is the new action compulsory ?
no , the software updates are optional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the binding updates are only valid for the vehicles , the Schumann software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says An@@ ja S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
its retro@@ fit has arranged the power station @-@ Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) .
how and when are customers informed about updates ?
the makers have announced a fast implementation in the next few months , but still not mentioned a precise date .
Daimler has communicated , to post every person concerned .
if any inspection is due , I will be completed within the frame .
how long should the re@@ inde@@ xes be taken in a total ?
&quot; difficult to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ an@@ in .
the slopes of the engagement of the manufacturers as well as the political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for we have seen voluntarily the car manufacturers are not acting on the subject environment so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long will the update last ?
the retro@@ fitting itself could last in the workshop only three to four hours .
time fen@@ ders could be to get an appointment .
what do motor@@ cyclists , who do not drive a car of BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?
the ACE betra@@ ys to wait .
pres@@ um@@ ably foreign manufacturers would re@@ draw , so S@@ met@@ an@@ in .
is now a massive price of Euro @-@ 4 @-@ cars ?
the ACE feared this .
but even in the regions , where passengers dro@@ w@@ ned .
in rural areas there have so far been no valu@@ ation for older diesel .
the ACE stock , with a sale yet to be seen .

Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first prize @-@ giving ceremony among President Tru@@ mp promises to become politically .
one of the winners will not come - from protest .
ll C@@ ool J ( 49 ) is one of the cov@@ eted prizes of the renowned Kennedy Center .
as announced the cul@@ ling direction on Thursday , this year also singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ on@@ el Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the choreo@@ graphic in Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV @-@ producer Norman LE@@ AR ( 95 ) .
the awards were handed over to the beginning of December .
traditionally , U.S. President Donald Tru@@ mp will hold a reception together with his wife Mel@@ ania at the awarding .
this was announced with the progressive TV series , announced that it already announced to rel@@ inqu@@ ish participation in the gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this presidency has decided to negle@@ ct the arts and human rights - to depri@@ ve them the means - and that is de@@ bit@@ ed me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year Est@@ ef@@ an said , she will use the conversation with Tru@@ mp in order to clarify their point of view .

we make the city life worth
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ master , goes to R@@ ente in the coming year .
the job is already written - suitable candidates are ra@@ r .
for 31 years W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ master .
and the work still makes him great fun as he convey@@ s in the press meeting .
he reports of varied , but also demanding tasks that are waiting for its successor .
at the same time , it mir@@ ac@@ ulously aware that so far no application will fulfil the requirement profile .
the city seeks an architect or civil engineering at the next time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus it should be - in compliance with the regular notice of notice - an even enough time for a processing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since Has@@ lach is a consultant for the administrative community as a sub @-@ law authority , the applicant has to prove appropriate su@@ pre@@ macy .
for this function aims to keep the city in any case .
if this cannot be filled with them , the citizens would have to leave the public up to Offen@@ burg .
but the proximity to the city and itself is important , says W@@ acker , who reported from a good working environment as well as good mood between authority and citizens .
some significant projects have accumulated in office over 30 years , looking back at the W@@ acker with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city life @-@ worthy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is confident about the building office and its employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future varied projects are on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ als and the Nieder@@ s@@ vor@@ y park are about to be moved .
the Kin@@ ties between Bol@@ len@@ bach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the state of state is still subject .
the latter alone will make up with around 1.5 million euros in be@@ ech , &quot; if we do it right , &quot; appreci@@ ates W@@ acker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything in all wait great tasks for my successor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
aged is available for a Stadt@@ bau@@ master of large room scope .
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s own building court and gar@@ den@@ er , there can be quite flexible to react .
&quot; you can move a lot , &quot; like w@@ acker , and the creation of green plants will often be praised by citizens and visitors .
because the old town stands as ensemble under monument protection , whether it is important to have an eye for it , which will fit , &quot; when new bodies are approved , empha@@ si@@ zing the schei@@ d car@@ et@@ aker .
anyway , the Stadt@@ bau@@ master bears high responsibility .
he is a builder , &quot; at the end everything is going on here about my table . &quot;
he has been able to count on many years of employees : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been here for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( deep building ) for 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also , that his successor remains long , wishes W@@ acker : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who would really identify and stay with the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good working environment , but also for the further development of the city .
who would like to put Roland W@@ acker , should provide information about the city of Has@@ lach a graduate studies as a graduate engineer or Bachelor of expertise and expertise in the field of construction and construction law .
the municipal office focuses on high and deep @-@ building , construction planning , cru@@ ising affairs , administration of urban property , municipal property , with building yard and city gar@@ den@@ er , as well as under@@ mining authorities , including monuments .
bike on pi@@ pel@@ ines : southern rail locked
according to police , the blue bike had previously been thrown by the blue bike from the railway track in the area of Le@@ ob@@ ener Street ( B@@ 116 ) on the wires .
these were so badly damaged that the her@@ b@@ aking freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go from two male perpetrators and looking for the night time to them .
near the scene we were witnessed a ros@@ ary sco@@ oter and a bike driver had been observed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ bu@@ zz@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Ö@@ BB @-@ spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch for APA . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perpetrators and the perpetrators are brought in great danger and also endangered the rail traffic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
apart from the damage to the Lo@@ k and the plant , as well as the late @-@ minute drive and the costs for rail travel traffic , you could also get to the perpetrators of the rail customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in total , be of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; significant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to go out , the speaker said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damage was repaired on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the railway line could be guided without a disability .
nearly ten person@@ ages were off@@ posted afternoon , two of them survey the correspondence .
Gü@@ ter@@ ators did not get out , but they had a delay .
according to Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be exchanged approximately 200 meters upper sections .
the ins@@ ulators and Ma@@ sten were also damaged .
red meat , milk products and chocolate could help IB@@ D ( inflammat@@ ory intestinal diseases )
red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a night@@ mare .
but a new study claims the exact opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , the symptoms of patients could alle@@ vi@@ ate patients with infl@@ amed intestinal diseases .
the incur@@ able condition that affects approximately 1.3 million in the US $ 1.3 million and in the United Kingdom are 300@@ ,000 , recur@@ ring or bloo@@ dless diar@@ rhe@@ a , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
while those affected are usually advised to alle@@ vi@@ ate meat and dairy products to alle@@ vi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers found at the Washingtoner University discovered that the essential amino acid Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins are contributing to developing immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant intestinal tract .
the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , stated that immun@@ cells in the intest@@ ine , stated to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes , who hide in the food , not penetrate into the body .
cells , which are capable of dis@@ solving inflammation , are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging the tissues .
if the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation , it can result in a inflammat@@ ory intest@@ ine .
in experiments has been determined that a kind of tolerance @-@ promoting immun@@ o@@ cells in mice is found that a particular bacter@@ ium bear in its initi@@ ates .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tre@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the components of proteins - to dis@@ solve the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial and l@@ ac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han had the mice in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and an in tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han rich diet toler@@ ant , less inflammat@@ ory intestinal wor@@ shi@@ us promotes if the same system is also in people .
the post @-@ doct@@ orate in Dr. Luisa Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan searched for a kind of immun@@ o@@ cell that promotes tolerance as they found out that a group of study powers had such cells , but another group of the same tribe that had been accommod@@ ated , but this did not have .
they assumed that the difference had to do with the intestinal microphone of mice - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which usually live in the stomach @-@ intestinal tract .
the dy@@ es of mice were en@@ rolled DNA sequ@@ entially and have been found six bacterial species , which were present in the mice with the immune cells , but without them were missing in the mice .
mice were raised in a ster@@ il@@ ous environment so that they did not l@@ acked the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ om and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
in order to understand how the bacteria grow on the immune system , the researchers L. reu@@ ter@@ i can grow in a liquid and over@@ led small amounts of fluid without the bacteria - to un@@ ri@@ pe immune cells that have been isolated from mice .
the immune cells developed to the toler@@ ant @-@ toler@@ able cells .
when the active component has been cleaned out of the fluid , it proved to be an out@@ product of the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ Met@@ abol@@ ism that is known as an i@@ dol @-@ 3 @-@ l@@ actic acid .
if the researchers have doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the for@@ age of mice , the number of such cells were hal@@ ved around 50 percent , but if the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ .exe have been hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by the half .
Dr. Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan declared that people have the same toler@@ able cells such as mice and that most of us protect L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract .
it is not known whether the Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ P@@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i developed the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han have been found in people with inflammat@@ ory intestinal diseases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote , since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ levels can result in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i to extend this popularity . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic has committed a &quot; genius &quot;
at Manchester United has signed an &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , believes Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der fiel@@ der on Wednesday evening his debut on Samp@@ it had .
the 40 million pounds of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A @-@ Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday begins , and impressive in the bracket role as people like Paul Sz@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira , after expos@@ ing .
MA@@ TIC was however excluded from the prepar@@ atory Asia tour of Blues and managed just 45 minutes , what M@@ our@@ in@@ ho had to improve before the start of the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will help him to be ready sooner than later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; three of four to get , thank you to the association , &quot; he added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they got four out of four , but they have given great effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner into the sky
the U.S. airplane maker Boeing has the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers in the sky painted .
the pil@@ ots flew from Seattle to the US state Washington , but the drawing began but in Mar@@ qu@@ ette in US state of Michigan , and moved in the form of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers over the US , which are several thousand kilometres .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar shield , the form of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers was to be .
the whole was an endurance for new engines .
Boeing had previously made such advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus the number &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the Boeing &apos;s logo was painted in the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new Char@@ ge for Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a problem
however , as the wind is turning : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still an SPD boss , the Socialists and Democrats pres@@ idents are always in the elections with a certain concern after Berlin .
merely no interference from the party central , merely a counter @-@ wind from the covenant - that was the most important desire of the election fighters .
since Martin Schulz leads the Party , it has changed fundamentally .
since then , the employees from the Willy Brandt @-@ Haus will observe the events in the SPD @-@ governed state capitals .
what Mr Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year , would not be described in the approach at the end of the year .
there were deep @-@ reductions .
and this one after another .
the Federal CD@@ U looking after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony sees a generic signal against co@@ ali@@ tions of SPD and Gre@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows once more : red @-@ green can simply not govern reliable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said CD@@ U @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber to the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the surprising fra@@ gment of a Green Members ruled the government of Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) in a heavy crisis .
five months before the country &apos;s elections , its red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ vote majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green @-@ federal business leaders Michael Kellner , called on the tr@@ ams of Nieder@@ s@@ ächs@@ ische Green @-@ MP El@@ ke T@@ icino to return their mandate .
the transition to the CD@@ U means a clear for@@ tification of the voters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ ke T@@ ops must immediately withdraw its mandate &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the federal business leaders and electoral campaign of the Gre@@ ens Network Deutschland ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sigh@@ s an SPD electoral campa@@ ign@@ ers , than on Friday morning , the new Job Co@@ ins reached the party central . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan W@@ eil , SPD @-@ Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands after the super@@ visor of the green members of El@@ ke T@@ ancing to CD@@ U without their own ruling majority .
it is the provisional climax of all series of large and small crises in SPD state associations .
and no one knows what comes next .
the Mis@@ ere began with the unexpected defeat at the Saarland &apos;s election in March .
a blue eye , more not , cal@@ med the comrades of the past .
after the elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and Nord@@ rhein @-@ Westfalen everything will be different .
that was why it became very much worse .
the defeat in Kiel put the SPD into the diving , the Düsseldorf @-@ ple@@ ite Haute the Party smooth .
so , the comrades went back in the weeks after that .
then when they had just had new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg .
and with him the next drau@@ ght came .
Mayor Ola@@ f Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD @-@ chief , lost his Nim@@ bus in that weekend because he sat in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie , while his city burned .
and because he was in crisis communication after that pretty much all false , what one can do wrong .
since then , Sch@@ olz fights its political survival .
so now also Stephan W@@ eil .
due to the VW exhau@@ st bure@@ tor and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Nieder@@ s@@ ächs@@ ische Prime Minister has already been in criticism for a long time .
mi@@ ese transformations came from .
nevertheless , or perhaps straight therefore , W@@ eil tried to put stronger in the covenant of the past few weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aim of the former mayor of Hanover to expand its power in Berlin also remained un@@ conce@@ aled comrades from Martin Schulz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they let him grant him as they talked about a stabili@@ zation of the party .
now the exact opposite could enter .
in this case , W@@ eil has no blame on the party &apos;s internal force .
and Schulz is not at all at all .
and un@@ iting times , the comrades try to keep the ranks closed .
their wrath is directed to the Gre@@ ens , and here mainly on the tr@@ ap@@ ing parliam@@ ent@@ arians of T@@ ops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic , such as Ms T@@ alle makes her own career entry on the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , Chief of the Party in the SPD parliamentary Bundestag , the editorial network Deutschland ( R@@ ND ) .
MS T@@ erc@@ er is not elected as a director of his person , but over the country list of the Dutch Gre@@ ens in the Parliament , so the Lower Saxony @-@ Sax@@ on .
the logical consequence would be that they have returned their mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , Chief of the SPD parliamentary Bundestag , lam@@ ents a &quot; in@@ democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the voters gave four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan W@@ eil as Prime Minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann who leads to the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on SPD as top of the Bundestag , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well , the personal career results of a future CD@@ U @-@ members &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ordered to clear the backgrounds .
I want to know if there has been more or there has been further ple@@ dges of the CD@@ U Nieder@@ s@@ achsen .
funding of the Centre III
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wants to furn@@ ish his house in the years can soon get support from the country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
about this informed Mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives of St@@ eg urban development on Wednesday in delicate .
at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ ind@@ ler gave another look at that far .
since 1991 it has been given in delicate san@@ ction areas .
at that time , in the renovation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the land of Baden @-@ Württemberg has taken over two thirds of the funding .
in the refur@@ bish@@ ment area II from 2005 to 2016 , the supplement was still at 60 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the existing ones are a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; success project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - it is finally important to promote internal development , and not just to enter new building areas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 4 April , we received the information given by the Govern@@ ors Karlsruhe to give it a renovation area III .
the grant amount 8@@ 33 333 Euro , of which 500@@ ,000 Euros of the country , the rest from the community received .
what is the renovation of the renovation area ?
you will continue to investigate so Sch@@ ind@@ ler , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are .
but it also plays a role whether in the planned field in general interest , to san@@ ure .
if necessary , the regional borders could then also be postponed .
the tour represented on Wednesday night evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
cellar presented the contents of the federal government program &quot; Social Town , &quot; in which the refur@@ bish@@ ments would then be performed .
core of the program are the rev@@ itali@@ zation of internal towns , improving living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure .
the measures would be object @-@ related , which is stated per property .
the renovation area would then finally be defined as a stat@@ ute .
the eligi@@ bility period for the funding runs from 1 January 2017 until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
until September this year , however , a questionnaire was conducted only until September this year , as part of those involved in the refur@@ bish@@ ment area involved .
in November or December , the set of proposition is scheduled to take place as possible , so that the refur@@ bish@@ ment may commence in the coming year .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann subsequently stated that every Commun@@ e would have to carry out the said incident .
it is about to assess the urban development of the city and to decide when it is renovated and to what extent .
there will also be a refur@@ bish@@ ment in the register for each property .
pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will once again get rec@@ eding and get a picture of the situation , she said .
Got@@ zel , a key success factor for the project is the participation of the participants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , there will be questionn@@ aires who will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and will be filled out until the end of the summer holidays . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; building and real estate agent , &quot; in which it is among other things to view the construction and refur@@ bish@@ ment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the gray questionnaire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; household and housing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; data can be made to size , distribution and residents of a housing space . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the blue &quot; operational arc &quot; is only to complete when in building business rooms are operated .
however , to note , Got@@ zel definitely pointed out that a filled questionnaire is not at the same time a request for funding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , new @-@ ups are not eligible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sch@@ ind@@ ler stressed that the distribution of the funding after the &quot; wind &quot; principle &quot; work - who first comes , hor@@ des first .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you cannot make a grants for later &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the end , pictures of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Local &quot; II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a reconstruction &quot; tasty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
British invent@@ ors places itself a micro@@ chip , in order to come with a hand movement in house and car
a bri@@ tish inventor is the first in the country , which is equipped with a micro chip , so that he can open his door@@ step , and even start his car with a hand@@ ing movement .
Steven North@@ at , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thum@@ bs and foref@@ inger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he has himself with Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory an@@ es@@ th@@ esi@@ sten at the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to make sure that the implant process is carried out according to medical standards .
the technology resembles a cats and dogs im@@ pl@@ ated micro@@ chip and only takes 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. North@@ at wants to alter the castles in houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all available at a surcharge of £ 300 per lock .
the married father of one has now built both at home and BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which starts when his hand is at the wheel .
the promotions of the White House costs the tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands of real estate ads
the decision of the White House , a marine helicopter to fly to the South La@@ wn for an event that highlights the American manufacturing in the last month , costs tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the specifications of the military , which were left to the TI@@ ME magazine , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars .
the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky v@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One when the President is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tru@@ mp , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and guiding officials of the White House made a tour of products out of all 50 states .
the helicopter @-@ Hel@@ icop@@ ter was shown next to a yacht from Maine , a fire@@ fighter car from Wis@@ cons@@ in and a forkli@@ ft truck from Mississippi .
the military office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or FRA@@ GO , barely 36 hours before the helicopter on the South La@@ wn S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for operation of the helicopter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just wanted you to be aware of because it is an unusual event with a high visibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the comm@@ ent@@ ur of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 at the eve of the event of his superi@@ ors , the vice @-@ com@@ mander of aviation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message showed that the helicopter met on July 17 at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning on the South La@@ wn for the event at 15 o &apos;clock , and remained so long until the lawn was given between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed , due to the limitation of the hours a second team would need a second team for the return flight .
the original flight home was during the event at the helicopter , while the security personnel of the unit remained on the floor by plane .
from the records made available from the TI@@ ME records were not clear whether a second flight is needed .
the H@@ atch Act provides federal states to use state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ owned property for political purposes .
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked if the event could violate the determination .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a question that we asked was whether it was a violation of H@@ atch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the com@@ mander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you are closed , &quot; answering the dep@@ uty com@@ mander .
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not be covered by the H@@ atch Act .
but official events also have political tones .
at the event the president gave an impetus for the reform of the health reform , which was in the Senate , and he pro@@ hi@@ ked the efforts to susp@@ ect the government regulations .
making use of the airplane , which is known as Marine One or Air Force One , for politically beneficial purposes is hardly a new phenomenon .
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for the journey .
but to demand their use only for a photo @-@ OP is unusual .
Tru@@ mp was conducted in February an investigation as the Presidential aircraft in front of the background of his first campaign r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that acc@@ entu@@ ate over the use of presidential plane through its predec@@ essors .
&quot; the White House is enthusiastic about the show &quot; Made In America &quot; - the products from all 50 states , which are manufactured by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the Deputy Pres@@ ses@@ sive Secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters .
h@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws often lead training flights in the region around Washington and in the South La@@ wn through to susp@@ end the US President in the White House with precise census .
as a Tru@@ mp in early July at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 in the White House has led to 58 exercises .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event was missing in the training requirement for the month , said one be@@ amer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
hel@@ per units flew in addition to 11 hours on this day for &quot; non @-@ depress@@ ants . &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pay@@ ers were responsible for any of the other Re@@ qu@@ el@@ ites who were presented at the trade show .
a spokes@@ man by Si@@ kor@@ sky said , the company was not involved in the Hel@@ icop@@ ter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not maintain budget@@ ary design@@ ations for presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to St@@ und@@ el@@ ari@@ fication of the U.S. Department of Defence for the fiscal year 2017 , the DO@@ D Er@@ re@@ funds for the v@@ H @-@ 3D is available 24@@ 380 USD per flight @-@ hour .
records of the unit see the flight time of the plane as 30 minutes from the native base of the Navy Cor@@ ps Air Facility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House argued that the actual cost of operation of the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers to set on the basis of estimates for re@@ funds sets is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in annual funding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a br@@ ink study from 2015 , the revenue rates for DO@@ D will not include the personnel costs , but also take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and contract .
at that time , the former pres@@ et of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ reads , the use of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present these week things that are produced in America &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Sp@@ reads . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the Bundes@@ State Connecticut very proud that they contribute to our national security and I &apos;m assum@@ ing that hundreds , if not even thousands of people are dependent on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment , for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ ess .
it is of course adequate to highlight this . &quot;
it was not clear whether Tru@@ mp was inter@@ acting with the helicopter , when he entered his round about the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire@@ man &apos;s seat .
in the White House , Tru@@ mp spoke at the representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and rolled with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have three of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the TC Blue @-@ Weiss Ne@@ uss will start tomorrow at 11 am in Kiel at the Tab@@ el@@ end@@ ent Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer SV .
despite having five games still mak@@ ell@@ os@@ er balance sheet , the top @-@ rated of the Second tennis Bundesliga has given the meaning to reality .
the chef Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has respect the opponent .
&quot; this is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation .
especially on the back positions I find the team very well . &quot;
for class and stability at Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer SV especially the imports from the high north .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even refer to bet@@ s in the Davis Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and they are also strong in double , &quot; says Z@@ ay with views of Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andre Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ar and E@@ ben O@@ read , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen as well as Andreas B@@ j@@ sex@@ hus ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; this is as always hard for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there you need also a good serving happiness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ uss@@ er team for the trip to the high north stands handy .
his debut for blue @-@ white might give max@@ im jan@@ four .
it is the moment that the Italian Bi@@ ella active French@@ man does not create an active French@@ man to the Bundesliga game , coming to the tournament in the Czech Li@@ bere@@ c playing Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) for his first deployment in this season .

how America can harm the O@@ MV
indeed , Donald Tru@@ mp did not work when he j@@ ailed his signature under the law to tigh@@ tening the sanctions against Russia .
&quot; in his hands , the law was en@@ acted , &quot; did the Congress packed a few &quot; constitutional requirements . &quot;
even the response from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels fo@@ amed against the US leadership .
after all , the design sees to pun@@ ish European enterprises that help Russians build gas pi@@ pel@@ ines into the EU .
since then , investors of the domestic O@@ MV , which together with other European firms are co @-@ financed by the construction of the Russian Baltic Baltic Stream 2 .
the threats is enormous .
nevertheless , it is too early for an estim@@ ation of the consequences , so the official statement of the oil concept .
in fact , Donald Tru@@ mp had to awaken the sanctions even as an executive order to life .
twelve weapons are at your choice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has seen what the Group could rep@@ el and which could truly we@@ h@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nar@@ cos Staff@@ el 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is put into the center of the hot series by Net@@ fli@@ x
despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , the Pablo Es@@ co@@ bars K@@ iller revealed , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x is not yet over .
the rel@@ ays three and four were already confirmed by the streaming service , the first received her first trailer and showed the latest bu@@ cks of the show .
with the third season the DE@@ A has directed its attention to the richest organisation of the drug trafficking in the world : the Cal@@ i @-@ Kart@@ ell .
led by four powerful god@@ parents , they operate &quot; like a Fort@@ une @-@ 500 @-@ company &quot; only with more governmental and non @-@ violent actions .
GI@@ L@@ BER@@ TO Rodri@@ guez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Alc@@ azar ) is the leader of the Kart@@ ell , Miguel Rodri@@ guez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Alberto Amm@@ ann ) command@@ ing the Mexican connection , and Ch@@ epe Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is located in New York .

Rolle back@@ wards : the city provides 46 kitchen@@ ettes
the town organ@@ ises the K@@ ita @-@ lunch again itself .
with fixed contact partners for the children and a assignment to the team .
in the city &apos;s day workshops the clock will come back .
in September 1 , the city of Kre@@ feld covers the food supply in the urban children &apos;s day facilities ( Kit@@ as ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , assistant director in the field of youth aid , this is good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are all very pleased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
bo@@ oming is still cooked out of house : a Cat@@ erer takes over this task and delivers fresh cool@@ ed cool@@ ed .
the city operates in the area of 46 day@@ care centres , in 44 the children get a warm meal at lun@@ ch@@ time .
last Kit@@ a@@ year had 2@@ 800 children at the tables , and the need is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , not only children , the 45 hours of hours are taken care of , in the K@@ ita at noon &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour support if children remain until 14 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 participants will start from 1st September kitchen service : you have warm the angel@@ ic foods , supplement them around salad , cru@@ k@@ ost and fruits , por@@ tees the meal individually , give the food out , rin@@ se , rin@@ se and clean the kitchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; workers are firmly allocated to a K@@ ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the size - there is bran@@ ched , as well as sev@@ enty @-@ scale institutions - decide on the circum@@ ference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers now belong to the K@@ ita @-@ Team , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus they are much more closely involved and it is easier to implement educational concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because that is why it is about healthy eating and cooking lessons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the children should help prepare food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is sensible .
also suitable for the children .
&quot; they have a well @-@ known strength in the K@@ ita , one person who is familiar to them and not ever @-@ changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the cleansing of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - so far also the task of the kitchen forces - is done in the future by special cleaning personnel .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - in addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen performance also has the charm that they have seen in the cost comparison between self @-@ protection and foreign procurement for the city as the most economical , it is called the Press Office .
and that , although 46 divi@@ den@@ ies are new to be re@@ configured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours fall into weight not so strongly at about 750 people in the education area , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Afgh@@ an democracy depends on the women &apos;s political role , says the UN
elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the Chief of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ som , acting Head of the Mission of the United Nations , said that hundreds of women are can@@ o@@ ding in the provinces in the provinces . three women run for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women .
&quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement .
elections can only be very representative and credible when women are fully involved and involved in all parts of the election process .
Afgh@@ an elections for the Provin@@ cial Council and the presidential elections take place on April 5th .
the Taliban have released threats against a choice process which coinci@@ de with the transition from international martial art to an advisory role .
this year , elections for the first time will be peaceful from a democr@@ atically elected government to the next .
Hay@@ som said , a strong role for women will continue to strengthen the democratic success of Afghanistan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Afgh@@ an independent voting Commission reported that 1,2 million women were registered by a total of 3,@@ 6 million voters . &quot; &quot; &quot;

GM@@ B @-@ concern about investment in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
a trade union wants to scru@@ b itself at the managers of the Bis@@ ku@@ it producer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie on the long @-@ term obligation to production in their work in Glasgow .
GM@@ B Scotland said that the company weigh on the future of investments at the Tol@@ l@@ cross location .
over 500 employees work in the work , which sets apart from other products hob@@ by@@ bs and Rich Tea cookies .
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ i said he has invested over 5 million pounds in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that employees and trade union representatives would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first experienced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the stores of the company called GM@@ B Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to express &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerns that funding for the modernisation of production lines will not be &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; GM@@ B @-@ Senior @-@ organizer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that we can gain no clarity about the needs and investment plans for the future of Tol@@ l@@ cross for the future of Tol@@ l@@ cross . &quot; &quot; &quot;
families of families have worked here and the labour force concentrate strongly on the local community and the Greater Glasgow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage .
therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wage and prosperity , and against the background of Bre@@ xit , the rising costs of living and of the chronic production , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently draw a flu@@ ent production of attention at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
a spokes@@ man of Pla@@ dis said : &quot; the Fili@@ alle@@ e at Tol@@ l@@ cross has only received a letter from GM@@ B Scotland and the company will respond directly to that , as we appreciate the continuous commitment in employees and trade union officials .
we had a regular meetings with employees and GM@@ B representatives in Tol@@ l@@ cross where some questions were openly discussed .
we discussed with the staff that we operate like all companies that are active in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , our stores are constantly checked - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years we invested more than 5 million pounds in our Tol@@ l@@ cross site , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we recognise the heritage of Tol@@ l@@ cross as a production site . should change our operational processes at the location , employees and their trade unions will be the first to experience this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
has the PS@@ G Barcelona warned three years ago from N@@ ey@@ mar ?
the page of La League likes to rep@@ ent her interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Germain will not be re@@ trac@@ ed in her persecution of N@@ ey@@ mar , after having released a range of £ 189 million in order to dis@@ solve its free@@ wheel clause , but have they warned of Barcelona three years ago before the world stroke ?
the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer , as the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record in order to break more than the double of the previous brand , with Paul Sz@@ ba in the past season for 89 million pounds to Manchester United .
after ending N@@ ey@@ mar become the most expensive players in the world and for the best @-@ paid professional athletes in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of over 500@@ ,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is angry about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way out there , although a source near the Catal@@ ans has given that the club has always given his best to take care of him since his arrival made by San@@ tos in 2013 .
but was the football world warned of three years ago by the PS@@ G president before this prospect ?
as Manchester City , was interested in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for each association , who wanted to sign the best player by PS@@ G .
&quot; I am not worried , because they know that when they touch one of our players , we will be in opposition to them , we will contact her players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi .
&quot; we respect all the clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign one of our players to sign in , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have passed this line , with the Spanish club at the beginning of this summer interest in the PS@@ G @-@ Central fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti .
PS@@ G made clear that they would not allow it to travel from Italy under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar .

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Report ent@@ reli@@ ed Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Report on the abuse of the Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is the author and histor@@ ian Michael H@@ emann .
the final report on the abuse of the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen on the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen continues for discussions .
Christian Weis@@ ke , spokes@@ man of the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; stated after the publication of the earlier Regen@@ s@@ burger Bishop and today &apos;s Card@@ inal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year brother of the em@@ eri@@ ous Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an excuse .
it would serve the prestige of the Catholic Church , when Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express her deep regret about his own om@@ is@@ sions or her at that time incorrect assessment of the proceedings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Vatican paper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; however critici@@ zed that in coverage on violence in the cathedral @-@ cats will be measured with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two digits &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to the handles in Regensburg , no one is that it would have to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sh@@ ame@@ ful and sh@@ ame@@ ful deeds &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but be striking , but the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; medi@@ al manipulation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; thus the author in Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historians and member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics committee . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit of having the Catholic Church as the source of all evil , is already part of the everyday experience and prepar@@ es the public opinion which is for normal to keep it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Scar@@ aff@@ ia &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis can be found in an interview with Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk : &quot; you are welcome to the church and this is a ti@@ ring fres@@ hen . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , she pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blows a quite normal pedago@@ gical means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be ready with che@@ ek@@ y children as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is unfair to apply today &apos;s standards to previous decades , because the world has changed .
in connection with reports on abuse of abuse often also pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also appeared .
completely w@@ ron@@ gly , says author and histor@@ ian Michael H@@ emann , who dealt with R@@ atz@@ inger the reminder of &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I must accept Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he adds the results of the final report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ sided report published by the dioc@@ ese Regensburg with clarification at the lawyer by Ulrich Weber ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with high pl@@ au@@ tism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; victims of attacks , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen sexually ab@@ uses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the final report it is said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , which was active from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg : &quot; in summary , it can be kept that from Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister were applied in many cases forms of physical and psych@@ ic violence .
especially with high pun@@ ctu@@ ality , the punishment for the pupils could also be dis@@ astrous .
in contrast to numerous other accus@@ ations in contrast to numerous other accus@@ ations that many victims are the common humanity from R. , and therefore even in numerous cases , even in many cases , even positive memories with it . &quot;
in the interview E@@ emann , why the final report on the abuse of the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was reli@@ eved of his opinion .
Mr. H@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; Pre@@ vention of Non@@ violence against prot@@ ection@@ ery at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; is a contradi@@ ct@@ ory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
to a stand many students stand out his &quot; humanity . &quot;
for the other he also appears as chol@@ est@@ ker and perfec@@ tionist , which was not a top performance by the Ö@@ f@@ teren .
how do you evaluate the bio@@ graph this final report ?
Michael H@@ emann : once you read the effort and reads the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to be wondering why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger occurs at all in it .
he are just eight pages devoted to him and he is clearly acqu@@ itted from every suspici@@ on of the mid@@ - or co @-@ knowing in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
also the non@@ violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool had occurred outside of his own sphere of action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can pre @-@ ject &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at best , learn from it too late or have not taken the first hint . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the don@@ ate Secon@@ dary School on which he worked , was perceived by practically all respon@@ dents , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rede@@ mption &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; better world &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus also the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger describes him an excellent testimony , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; knowledgeable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the guys regularly cat@@ ered with cakes , bis@@ cuits and Bon@@ b@@ ons and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; always covered by grapes of children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a minority compl@@ ained about its perfec@@ tionist and its high emo@@ tional ality , which also led to W@@ ut@@ tah .
that he d@@ ined not only with chairs and cast the key federation on the ground , but also ear@@ ed boys , and too fre@@ er guys to the hair or ears , he has already given himself years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and apologi@@ zed for it .
to his honorary capacity , however , it must be said that such educ@@ ations in the question@@ able period , the 1960s and se@@ ven@@ ties , were widespread , in parents like with teachers .
do you also know such breeding @-@ methods ?
of course , I think everyone of us who was born in 1968 .
I have also experienced this in a world @-@ wide school , a state school .
compared to what this is actually happening in this report , namely the irre@@ plac@@ eable sexual abuse and non@@ violence at the pre @-@ school , are certainly dre@@ amed .
as one already asks herself if it is not more to do with his famili@@ arity and his role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media has just rus@@ hed to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Bav@@ arian State , many who have never understood him , still eag@@ erly &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the truth is : the report reli@@ eved Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the media in connection with the report it reports much about the issue of misuse in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was put in the final report also any in@@ volution or co @-@ knowing with regard to sexual abuse to the load ?
Michael H@@ emann : very clearly no .
no single of the 67 victims of sexual t@@ aps claims to become familiar with the t@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were consecr@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never dar@@ ed to speak with my father or mother about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a subject of subject for the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrassing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem with the enlightenment of sexual abuse was and is that most victims were silent .
if they un@@ familiar with parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a ch@@ oral manager , who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators .
how do the cathedral @-@ cats make their role in regard to abuse ?
Michael H@@ emann : a respon@@ dent student formed it so : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I don &apos;t see a case in which he would have had the right knowledge ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) and could have stopped the respective offen@@ ders .
I consider it ... also for really absurd to accept that to be reck@@ oned to him ... Bu@@ bs become more urgent or more definite , or even more likely to have opened than against their parents , inter@@ nat@@ s@@ executives , etc .
that you speak to him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in the preliminary student and / or their environment , could not be confirmed within the framework of the examination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what sexual abuse concerns , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is therefore fre@@ eing from any co @-@ knowing .
thus , he cannot be thrown at him , nor did it prevent or have brought it to the ad .
therefore there is no reason to associate his good name with these contradi@@ ct@@ ory crimes , as unfortunately it was in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media a lot of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Non@@ violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was to read in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thrown out in the report . &quot;
must he live with this accus@@ ation ?
Michael H@@ emann : this is the big problem that in the coverage everything was mixed and mixed up to a huge mel@@ ange from sexual abuse and violence and somewhere , in the middle of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but this is precisely the abuse of the report .
there will be clean separately : between the pre @-@ school and the Gymnasium of the cathedral @-@ cats , between sexual abuse and violence as well as , we say once , other off@@ ences .
in addition , the report was dealt with inci@@ dents from time since 1945 , thus also for four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not ch@@ oral leader of the cathedral @-@ cats .
the whole horrible test education , the cases , in which Kn@@ aben of sa@@ di@@ sti@@ cal teachers were dec@@ eived , and amongst them , un@@ attended all at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ hofen , where actually sc@@ andal@@ ous states have to prevail .
but with those of whom Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he got the boy first to face when they were already on the Dom@@ sp@@ y Secon@@ dary School .
on what was the most witnesses emphas@@ ise , the theme of &quot; pre @-@ school &quot; tab@@ u .
it was only happy to escape you and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; heavenly &quot; stat@@ uses .
what was different in the forec@@ our@@ se of the cathedral ?
Michael H@@ emann : there was already discipline , but there was no sa@@ vi@@ cal violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report comes to the conclusion that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many victims put the general humanity from R. , and therefore even in numerous cases despite violence even positive memories with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so at most remains the accus@@ ation that have taken away .
however , despite all efforts , the report was able to define only two periods in which it was reported from the states at the pre @-@ school .
for the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he had just begun to establish himself and was responsible for the events at a school , where he was not working and responsible ( so the witness ) did not want to hear , and then again to 1993 .
G@@ loss Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in front of the states consistently the ears ?
Michael H@@ emann : no , because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ a Secon@@ dary School , which even re@@ produces the report .
in this he pointed out this point that in the pre @-@ school the audit will continue to be investigated . &quot;
even considering the danger of negative press @-@ public opinion , he recommended urgent obj@@ ections .
this was of course at a time when legal clarity existed , when audi@@ tors were long forgotten in Bavaria too .
before , they un@@ covered themselves in a legal gra@@ y@@ zone like everyone of us still knows .
there was hard to estimate for him where the affected might be exagger@@ ated or dram@@ ati@@ zed and where really the permitted border had been exceeded .
but one can not say , he had always looked away .
this is simply not true .
only in 1980 the audi@@ t@@ ance of schools was officially completed in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it is unfair to apply the current educational standards at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do you see it ?
Michael H@@ emann : we were talking of histor@@ ian since the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fall of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; thus the risk of jud@@ ging the past and today &apos;s moral standards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the inter@@ c@@ yst@@ ine has already right .
but this is of course not true of sexual abuse , which at all times ab@@ om@@ in@@ ally and also not for what was broken in the pre @-@ school of ad@@ versity and violence against inno@@ cent children &apos;s se@@ ams , which already goes far beyond what was then practicing .
that is all completely aw@@ ful and I am glad that it is finally re@@ working .
but at the same time I must accept Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , for all that had nothing to do with him .
its means of discipl@@ ining and punishment , so ear@@ ring and pull in hair and ears were widespread in the 1970s .
as physical const@@ ancy then it has been prohibited , he has also strictly adher@@ ed to it .
which picture of his rainy season has Georg R@@ atz@@ inger because in conversation with you for the book &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; reproduced ?
did you examine the topic also in the language ?
Michael H@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , therefore Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , told his perspective , as the cathedral @-@ cats played only a secondary role .
nevertheless , I do not dis@@ miss that he conducted a stri@@ c@@ ter regime there .
but that has to be said once again : without these perfec@@ tionist discipline , it would probably have been possible to form an institution of cat@@ tran@@ g , true cultural reflections of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cuits and Bon@@ b@@ ons alone , one alone makes no big singers and stand before each success , just in which area , however always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming .
what kind of people have you experienced by Georg R@@ atz@@ inger amongst the talks about her book ?
Michael H@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond , I have seen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really well and again and again experienced as wonderful , humor@@ ous , basic necessities , deep gl@@ it@@ ated and heart of good people , of which you could not imagine that he could also just be able to read a fly .
I am regularly coming with how many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen still today , 23 years after his trial , regularly contact him , read him to read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of their family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who have not forgive him today that he once was strictly speaking to them are clearly in the minority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most Dom@@ sp@@ atzen are today grateful to him that he enri@@ ches their lives and brought them to the world of music .
and that he is always a good , father &apos;s teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a lov@@ able respect to which they still look and to honor them .
and please , once again clearly , everything you pres@@ et to it are gu@@ ardi@@ ans methods that were at that time on the order of the day .
we can be glad we have overcome this time long ago .
but it is highly un@@ just , a man , just because he is promin@@ ently and has an even more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al s@@ cap@@ s@@ way .
there is the nasty purpose behind it , just too obvious .
for the report , which was just published , reli@@ eved him .
now the att@@ endant has been acquired , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has acquired great merits and without the outside Bay@@ erns and perhaps Germany probably no one would know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen ( finally in peace ) .
