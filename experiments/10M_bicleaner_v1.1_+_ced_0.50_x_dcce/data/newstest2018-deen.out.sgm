<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four cards to change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">A Irren Anstalt, where young people are meeting today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A pit chapel, where it is now excavated for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Petty-gardeners manage the one-hand reason of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official card of Munich supports exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It can be nervous when maps are out of date.</seg>
<seg id="7">The one knows each one has had to exalt itself, because the auto-Navi showed a green meadow instead of an overwalk road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historic maps of the digital Bayern-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportas Bavaria of the State government, are far from current - but it is very enlightening.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when you compare them with current online-cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the spread-area of the Münchner Mercury since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern-Atlas is a splattered canvas that one does not recognise as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the large picture postcard were collected for towns and municipalities of more detailed maps, so-called Urposibility datasheets.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were created according to the indications of the Bayerische Vermessaging government between 1810 and 1864 and skipping the first division of Bayerns.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army-leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the second period of war with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon had an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographic recording of Bayerns on behalf - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even if the French troops marched with the peace of Lunéville from 9 February 1801: there were today's neighbors, which created the idea of a region-wide region map.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph drove the project further, founded the" "" "Topographical Bureau" "" "- and thus the Bayerische Vermessengers administration" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The Urposibility blatt for Munich dates back to 1856 and is to be found at the Bayerische Landesbibliothek all else on the website of the Bayerische Staatsbibliothek.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison morning / Today is the example of the provincial capital most impressive.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is subsendling that appears relatively isolated within the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was built 21 years after the map, i.e. 1877, as a district of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses underscore focus on 1856 along today's Plinganserstraße which was named in 1878 to Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the Bavarian peasants against Austria 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today is the Westpark, one sees nothing but fields - at first sight: on the contrary, a small-disadvantaged card with dozens of lines and numbers: hand-written Flurks from the so-called "priming," which was derived from the source tax.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "small plots spread there today no farmers more - but small gardeners of the facility" "" "Land in Sun." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area stands out north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, since 1810 Schauplatz of the Oktoberfest, was in fact still a meadow - and no concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of the psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the urine sheet, one reads in the area of the present district Au-Haidhausen not only the street name "at Gasteig" or from the height "Towards" - but also in big letters "Irren Anstalt."</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfeld road there was once people with madvores.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "there was 1858 / 59 the Munich district-Irrenanstalt" "" "in the Auer Lügen" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872 Dr. Bernhard von Gudden did the establishment - that psychiatrist, who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwigs II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was progressive for his time and ended for example the accusation of so-called Irren." ""</seg>
<seg id="36">He has also banned the staff to apply violence against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, Head of the Museum of Haidhausen, who has worked for an exhibition with the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients there was first place, later it was extended to 500 places.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sometime this capacity is no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the cycles in hair 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">Since 2006 the Isar-AMPER-Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of the largest pelvic atricians in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="40">At the end of the former Auer Anstalt now young people meet in Munich Salesian Fesianum.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order was established in 1920 and took it into a youth-home with training facilities.</seg>
<seg id="42">West is the football field of the TSV East east, east residential buildings dating from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">In 2015 the children-house "Casa don Bosco" was built in an architectural reference to the origin of the Irvine in the Second World War, which was destroyed by bombing raids during World War II.</seg>
<seg id="44">The Marienplatz was about 1856 as the main square, "the merchant road was called" Kaufhof alley. "</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War was a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The bombs of the Allies in December 1944 lots of holes in the city center.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big remained to this day - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business buildings and a tomb chapel from the Middle Ages were once at the Marienhof, where these days will be the preset and on 5 April 2017 the spade for the second S-Bahn platform.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider slider the old Munich-card can be compared to the airimage of today - and the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Citizen-Law published for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National association for the promotion of colour has issued a warning for colored people who travel to Missouri on the basis of discriminating politics and racist attacks by the state.</seg>
<seg id="52">"" "" "" "the NAACP Travel Advisory for the federal state Missouri, which will bring special attention to the state by February 28th, as a series of questionable, because a number of questionable, rallies occurrences lately throughout the country and are remarked here" "", "it is stated in the Group's statement." ""</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently adopted law by Missouri, which makes man harder to win discrimination, as well as the prosecution authorities of the state, disproportionate to minorities, prompted the group to release the travel wartime, said the NAACP.</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "they have violations of civil rights, human beings happen." ""</seg>

<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not heard yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the US.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited incidents like racist Versions against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died under fragile circumstances at the beginning of the year after having had no gasoline any more during the journey and by the police of Missouri in custody without being accused of criminality.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also shows a recent report of the Office of the Generalstaatsu-old of Missouri, in which it is shown that black drivers in the state will hold 75 percent more frequently than whitefoot.</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware of and inform their families, friends and staff about what might happen in Missouri," said Chapel.</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people must be ready to bring it money or let the relatives know they travel through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri posted in 2015 100 hate speech, according to the latest figures from the hate-bred report of FBI, which increases the state with regard to the number of such violations at the 16th rank of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law which would make it harder to sue a company because of living or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberties (ACLU) issued voyages for Texas and Arizona, following the states of immigration law, to commit local prosecution authorities to divulge people because of immigration.</seg>
<seg id="66">They are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of other countries, but at the last time stakeholders have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">Weidezvist project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The fisherman Weidemagic n-Project is a success project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Bundestag Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac gave himself a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">At the rectangle of the family Schwendemann, representatives of the fisherman CDU-village together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MEPs.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann received first insights into his company, in which he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy rice, as well as many young animals and housed in five apartments tourist guests.</seg>
<seg id="72">"" "the" "" "black-milk" "" "is for him the alternate marketer track for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann." ""</seg>

<seg id="75">I can not work on such steep surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="76">The green space for a lot of work, much needed to be processed using the engine sense.</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have to fight here with the conditions and the topography," said Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003 he took over the elterous operation and engaged this without chemical plant protection and fertilisers, even if he does not conduct a biooperation.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear:" "" "the Commune has recognized the importance of the" "" "deception project" "" "and is happy about the leader promotion." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">The farmers have to support farmers at the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euro per hectare.</seg>
<seg id="81">They hope that the forestation of the surfaces could be moved even quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the biggest treasure that we have, are people who work in agriculture and make thoughts on how they will continue their operation," "" "said the Mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers have often been in criticism because of the promotion</seg>
<seg id="84">Over 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">The break surface amounts to 40 hectare not allowed until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Of the total cost of 71 500 Euros, half of over the leader was funded, a quarter carried by the municipality of fisherbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus, the farmers had to invest 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of pasture.</seg>
<seg id="88">"" "" "" "the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," "" "stated Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="89">Kordula Kovac stressed: "you are doing a really good job, without farmers and counseling do not go."</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "also for Peter Weiss was firm:" "" "here are the best food produced." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landsulation Purchase (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows the state promotion of pasture.</seg>
<seg id="92">The objective is the offensive of the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">Prerequisite is the presence of one of the LPR signed conveyor.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, the enclosed area may not be worse (Hanging over 35 percent) and must be threatened by the forestation.</seg>
<seg id="95">For the fisherman Weidezvaunching project, 2018 is currently running the application of eight participants with 24 plots that wish to build just under 16 kilometers from the fence.</seg>
<seg id="96">The reservation area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 Euro.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump is taking the Statue of Liberty before</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime transfer - it is when they begin to attacking the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate this just as any other - hence the careful fall of Saddam Hussone at the Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the keys-ideologists of the Trump-regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic Axt in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta by CNN on the proposals of the President on the drastic restriction of legal migration with the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To stay fair, Miller did not handle the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat landowners and Liberty-Imators could have found him when he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he attacked their significance, and in particular the meaning that it was written, when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus, 17 years after the completion of the monument, has been added to its base.</seg>
<seg id="105">When Miller Acosta impeel: "I don't want to enter a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem which you relate to that later was added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty is. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller lies properly right, but as he formulated it himself, it is not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary resonance on the ascending words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state does not only provide any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your humble, your poor, / your oppressed masses, who longing for, free to breathe, / the elusive waste of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time when the "miserable waste" was better to see on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller was not committed in literary review - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate: it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus, and their friends, who sat down to place their words after their death on the basis - did very good that they are accomplished a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicanism, representing the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-used classical image of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in its poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And there is a very different name for themselves: mother of the exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on the American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just like Lazarus the meaning of the statue changed, the people from the right wing wanted to change it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great cry of the rush of Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued that the Statue of Liberty was nobody to load, but rather an early neo-conservative, which bring the American flame into the remarked world: "Lady Liberty is moving ahead.</seg>
<seg id="119">It is intended to carry the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "the torch should not enlighten the way into the United States." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual is Limbaugh here on something crisp.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is entirely and certainly a question of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative deed of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen from the exhaustive, but hopeful people after long and often terrible trips to the decks of ships was seen.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is the truest sense to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Her statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And that is of course not the perspective that Miller and Trump will ever wish to recognize.</seg>
<seg id="127">Your torch is not supposed to enlighten the path, but the hatred that is the only source of power.</seg>

<seg id="161">The father of our land knew something from bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long until the newspapers drove him because of everything, from interior politics up to its political principles.</seg>

<seg id="1127">PSG can make sure the money lockers, so Neymar underwrites and bring it into a galaxy of other stars, given the funding of the team by the energy rich refractive family of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Associations may apply a lot of money for the purchase of players, but have to control them with legitimate revenue streams, which allow them to obtain the break even point in their on the football.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election on UEFA president in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that clubs, who in their quest for success had enormous debt to themselves, effectively cheat and risking to ruin, when banks or owners moved their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011, FFP shifted from the concentration to the debts of the clubs to monitor their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model, the novel Abramovich was originally used in Chelsea - a club with potential and then strongly invested to improve the crew and build a global brand - to become a tougher matter.</seg>
<seg id="1133">During the current three-year-year-year period, which is running up to 2018, clubs can take losses in the amount of €30 million.</seg>
<seg id="1134">And although Platini 2015 has fallen from the presidency in Ungnade, his UEFA successor to Aleksander Cefera continues to detach them from excessive issues.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"" "" "" "surely FFP is not dead and we will reinforce the rules for the future," "" "said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for FFP from UEFA" "" "compared to The Associated Press during the past week." ""</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although the PSG has paid the buy-out-clause by Neymar in a package, it can distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of its contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar has signed a 5-year contract, leaving the limit for the next five years to the amount of 44.4 million euros in the annual financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has hit the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the most severe sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">The PSG received a reduction of 60 million euros (at that time 82 million dollars), which later was reduced to EUR 20 million - and it was arranged that the team members are eligible for the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players remains limited.</seg>
<seg id="1140">The UEFA is looking for clubs which might try to oversee their financial insight by joining their earnings by companies that are associated with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a Catalan company could not use the PSG, if the value of sponsoring should exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not be considered as legitimate income.</seg>
<seg id="1142">Exactly this happened in 2014, when the UEFA decided that the value of sponsorship of the PSA was blown from the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that a part of PSG-payments to Neymar over payments by the Organizing Committee of the World Championship in Qatar could be obtained in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar World Ambassador will become and such a manoeuvre for the UEFA regulators can simply be out of figure out.</seg>
<seg id="1145">The previous sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will still be more attentive, every attempt to bear in mind the rules.</seg>
<seg id="1146">The UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG via Neymars Transfer, sagittling on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, since they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The last published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 have achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros in sales of EUR 542.4 million.</seg>
<seg id="1149">The accounts for the last financial year have to be published.</seg>
<seg id="1150">PSG expects that Neymars arrived a blessing for sponsorship Deals, merchandising and triotting.</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association assumes that sales after the signing is at least 30 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Spanish League was clearly mistaken, one of the best football players to see, and she tried to prevent Neymars departure, by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP.</seg>
<seg id="1153">"it is a clear case of" financial intelligence "with the club and the state," said the President of the La League, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS in relation to Katars of the local ownership of PSG.</seg>
<seg id="1154">Arsenal Manager Arsene Wenger, whose society is owned by an American Sport-Tycoons, shares the reservation of La League against a State, which is financed by an association.</seg>

<seg id="1170">But there are only Swiss manufacturers.</seg>

<seg id="1184">This repetition of history is at the same time nostalgically because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80-year-era, for the 90-year-year-age-era (as the Pretch David Wain and Michael Shovels the Sketch Comedy "The State" for MTV, and for itself - that is, for 2001, before their stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to bigger things.</seg>
<seg id="1185">As a cultural artifact, it is equally a parody and an embodiment of our facet era permanent memories.</seg>
<seg id="1186">But as franchise feels like the time would be short.</seg>
<seg id="1187">"first Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not only because of its leading Humors (it contained an original story for a promising vegetables that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).</seg>
<seg id="1188">By getting off at the core of the gags - actors middle aged man play, children, who are grown, they still manage to gain the impossibility to regain the final part of the widget.</seg>
<seg id="1189">"ten years ago," with its adults, who now play adults, is less emotional-rooted and its parody goes more after the foundry principle, including a reef on the Stalker films of the 90-er years like "The Hand of Rocks the Cradle" ("The hand that looks the cradle").</seg>
<seg id="1190">At a point of time a character through an Apple-Powerbook, several inline skates and "a number of other things from the year 1991."</seg>
<seg id="1191">Many of the central stories are the same.</seg>

<seg id="1193">Victor (Ken Marino) has still not lost its virginity.</seg>
<seg id="1194">And there is still another crazy vicious Plot, included in the Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Shoe), which is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a well received impression of Michael Ian Black).</seg>
<seg id="1195">As always the exporters are the best part of the franchise.</seg>
<seg id="1196">It is especially good fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillons underbeard from "singles," whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy feels like an old crisp.</seg>
<seg id="1197">It is the moments of random insanity that could turn this franchise as a kind of repetitive "Seven Up!" series until he reaches what I see as its logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty years, how she will visit the film premiere of" Wet Hot American Summer. "</seg>
<seg id="1198">"Comrade Detective" on Amazon is now reminded of a different kind of nostalgia: to the revival of the Cold War by "The Americans," to the film "Atomic Blonde" and even an "Glow" with its East-fighting-West ring-iconography.</seg>
<seg id="1199">The comedy by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka is created to be a found TV show: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest, who fight for truth, atheism and the way of Marxism.</seg>

<seg id="1201">It is an ingenious idea.</seg>

<seg id="1203">There are some nice Gags for watching (the police spend time to watch chess on television as Americans perhaps do with football).</seg>
<seg id="1204">And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Maherslia Ali and Chlogoose Sevigny - ensures a decent game "Finde the voice out '.</seg>
<seg id="1205">But "Comrade Detective" is very committed to the true propagation of a doubtful propaganda dramas - a killer that carries a Reagan mask is involved - that it is often as a single one.</seg>
<seg id="1206">At six long episodes there is then, and the comedy is not fast or frequently enough.</seg>
<seg id="1207">"Comrade Detective," which was reacted to a lower length, his Agitprop-Satire could deliver better, since Gregor and Iosef always visit the American message whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who devour a bunch of hammerges.</seg>

<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, dropped from a large house in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court apartment.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it's a proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed their bags and sold.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," says Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">This apartment was shown in Earls Court, and it had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "I have fallen in love with them and made an offer on this day." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first visit, the 1,000 square square was completely rebuilt.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a slipped layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add cupboard and a mezzanine to optimize the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my request, "says it.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose she gave the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed from Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use 12,5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms to each other, leaving the architectural challenge in it, to create a mezzanine in which one could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to solve the default.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"" "" "" "the steel plant is quite complicated," "" "explains." ""</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms so that they were overriding each other without having to handle." ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">It was not just about building a simple platform but to create the steel so that it had the right height for the function up or down. "</seg>
<seg id="1334">This order allowed it to place Erfan, two rooms in full height - with a lot of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine, a classic copper window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Gestures: gold furniture, silverne Akzente and vintage Serge Mouille illumination set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">On both ends there is a short corridor mirrored to allow him to work longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen the mirror feels like a window into another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance mirrored units open space for all corners and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Due to the perception of a glamourable space the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Interfoldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering arts went inside," explains Erfan of the steel, furnified MDF-door.</seg>
<seg id="1345">"" "" "" "it is particularly important, so if you push the door to the door, very easy." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage box Joanne could gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the base area - or how your property is valued," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1348">"" "" "" "in a ruding form a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the floor size." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they have managed to enlarge the surface area and at the same time use high quality materials that get the room its luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things you touch and which therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you do not love yourself into the electric sockets in the walls.</seg>
<seg id="1352">These are important, but they do not play with your heart. "</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment is characterized by good design and elevated square metabolic rate of something very astonishing.</seg>
<seg id="1354">In fact, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave them.</seg>

<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If yes, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Polis reports that the new bar of the White House is planning to limit the flow of information to President Trump - including the reports of news media - in hope to hold the boss at an even more evenly course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of Reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new staff of the White House, met at his first working day at senior staff, he exhibited a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House, which he intends to repair: poor information that entered into the hands of the president.</seg>

<seg id="1397">President Trumps relationship to TV shows decades back - and now, where he is in the White House, his TV commercials is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"if Candidate was annoyed because of a fair trial, it was productive to show him that he was a fair reporting of places that were to convince," said the former election consultant Sam Nunberg in February to Politico.</seg>
<seg id="1399">Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote to the time that "the key to keep Trumps Twitter habit under control, according to six former election campaign officials to ensure that his personal media has a constant praise."</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps Twitter habit ever 'under control "was ridiculous.</seg>

<seg id="1403">We will probably never experience anything about the tweets, the Trump has not been sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his staff managed to keep it away several times, anger, then their efforts have been worthwhile.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But nobody has it consistently can prevent Trump Controls.</seg>
<seg id="1406">Part of the problem is that people in a White House which sets out from competing parties, always try to present their own agenda by promoting Trump Material that may help their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Polis - very busy with this story - reported in May on the preference of the advisors, the president for strategic reasons beyond doubt.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example which was described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>

<seg id="1411">Although Johnson was banned from Twitter because of a slide show or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he has voiced false accusations in the past and revoked it.</seg>

<seg id="1524">To what extent the climate change has played a role in the breakage of the iceberg, according to research, is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1525">In total, there have been a series of unusual breakdowns of ice cream breakdowns in the region for approximately 30 years, writes the U.S. research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in an Fakbackground.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, this could be related to the heating level.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The broken Koloss was so far a part of the Larsen-C-Schelfei.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeis floating on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>

<seg id="1533">I know some thing that also the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is in danger, because the front edges have never as far withdrawn as currently.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Moreover, the ice plate stands under voltage and can be broken down if at a key point a piece is slowed down.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of Schelfeis and iceberg increases the level as it does not swim in the water and ice creams as much water as it yields after the melt itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the cord finish that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before.</seg>

<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, expert of the agricultural research institution of CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "the lavender in Provence is effectively jeopardised because the plant was exposed to the impact of climate change, which has brought much less rain in the spring and in autumn much more.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has effects on the life span of lavender.</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist highlights the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The employees of the weekly Riodoce meet normally mites to check out their plans for coverage of the recent chaos in the state Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and ceaseless drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of her own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">It was told to them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-level journalists discuss what feels more secure: they are supposed to take their children to the office, who were in 2009 the aim of an attack with granules, or make them at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have three words written on a table on the front of the room: opponents, neutral, inflating.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporter, to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary, perceptions and emotionally.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drugs muggler, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspicious, on the secret list of the government or cartels, a catalog of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no rest at the time of violence, and while throughout the country the corpses are frequent, there are more journalists: at least 25, since president Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589 are standing after attacks and threats under federal protection and until now there was at least seven deaths in seven countries this year.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter is their publishers and their inspirer of Riodoce, the co-founder of Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist," "" "Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">Its absence is felt deep even though its presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Valdez presented his Middle-finger with the word "Justice," depends on the façade of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, bear T-shirts, who show his smiled face with glasses or its typical Panamut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop will take place less than two months after his death, and the reporter will discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although 2010 has been established a Sonder-Federal Office, in order to deal with the case of journalists, these according to the Committee on the Protection of journalists has initiated only two criminal proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most thousands of murder, which are associated with drug and organised crime every year, the murderers of journalists will rarely be brought to justice.</seg>
<seg id="1824">In Riodoce they still insist on the violence of Sinaloa, although they are innocent, and although the terrain now is still oblique.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting to discussion of security little benefit, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very silly, my time spent in this workshop," says he.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we know not the Why, we mistrust all."</seg>
<seg id="1828">In the morning of 15 May Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the provincial capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He managed to drive a few blocks far before its red Toyota Corolla was compelled by two men. he was shot from his car and 12 times was shot at it, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "Twelded river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The Sagittarius went away in his car and damaged it near.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two grown children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly in Culiacan freely.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzmans arrests last year and the delivery to the United States in January was saloa to become one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country, because rivaling political groups are fighting here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">There is nothing that in Sinaloa every day someone or more people can be shot on the road or that the cemetery is full of verted, two-story Mauser for drug royal, which are larger than many houses for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of 'peace' if only a cartel control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs routes in the United States has.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First of all, in February the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of a rivaling cartoons in the war with Guzmans children.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have annoyed the sons, suspected veins bought every copy of the issue as soon as they were extradited to newspaper kioske.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second fault was in it that Valdez did not force to force after the confiscation of another newspaper which had published the same story to leave the country to its own security.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and its killing is regarded as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived his friends and colleagues, that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He was active in 2003 as an experienced reporter for Noroeste, when he joined together with five colleagues for the founding of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to operate journalism without encountering the prey problem," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1847">At the time the newspaper earned a reputation for the courageous and honest reporting, and revenues and advertising took.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved it, hard-going investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication where they could read stories, which no one else to deal with.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the foundation of Riodoce she received the preschilled "Maria-Moors-Cabot-Prize" for their reporting in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the Protection of journalists for his courage in the persecution of the Mexican drugs of drugs, where ever they passed.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave voluntarily to that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"" "" "" "I want to go further," "" "he said at the time of CPJ" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1853">Drug trading in Sinaloa "is a lifestyle," he said in an interview with Rompeviento-TV last October.</seg>
<seg id="1854">"you have to take over the task that falls you as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb.</seg>
<seg id="1855">"" "I would not want to be asked:" "" "what did you do in view of so many dead... why did you not say what went before?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the Spaak, who was like a port worker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always carry his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar across from the office, and always sit at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now they ask: was his love to be routine forever?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death has also compelled them to question their own assumptions regarding how they can do their work best and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like it if you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their home starting and cross-cars," to move drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even at the best times, a high level of self-censorship and self-keeping.</seg>
<seg id="1865">To trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells wrong, stay away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The trouble is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal, that "smell is a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing with Javier has happened."</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, apply in Sinaloa no more - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, in which a gifted mixture of lucrative smugust routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is constantly changing.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where employees of Riodoce met for security training were suddenly no mobile phones allowed. days before, spyware, which is sold exclusively on governments, used for monitoring journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside two policemen were faced in front of the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were instructed by the provincial government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a mid-class district of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the shreporter, some of the reporter was asking whether these officers are among the 50 percent of the police officers, which the governor himself considered not trusted.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It has been months since the reporter has gone into the mountain landscape, where the drug banden de facto under control are under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week Riodoce has put on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former known boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exoposé of the government spending, concentrated on the hometown of the governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group that led in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the Prosecutor's office, a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was advisable when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows, that the restaurant is a favorite venue on drug dealers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter was made from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician, who ruled the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (Pri), which ruled almost the whole century all political planes.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Several pri-gure were accused because of high-quality cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this pub, including one where a son of "El Chapo" Guzman went to a military attack.</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months before, the readers would have seen the column of Valdez as the best informed source of kidnapping.</seg>

<seg id="1886">The office of Valdez has been dedicated to the storage room for signs and stickers, dedicated to the murder of journalists because the employees have become something that they have never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporters Miriam Ramirez snaps up a few signs and went to a demonstration next morning to a demonstration for another journalist to the office of the Prosecutor's office.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed, in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA testing, that it is his.</seg>
<seg id="1890">Throughout the country journalists have become more pressing, organized in organised protests "SOS Press" on walking and construction.</seg>
<seg id="1891">On that day the director Bojorquez is gone to Washington and tries to gather international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">In a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day following the murder of Valdez Ramirez decompose the authorities, journalists and bring them to leave because they said the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has since been asked to be once again divided by the government because it is worried that their anger has hurt their objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico organized by organised crime, who took part in government officials and a simultaneous society. "</seg>
<seg id="1895">"" "in his last book" "" "Narco journalist" "" "he wrote that reporter are not only killed by drug gangs but also on command of politicians and security forces, organised by organised crime under a ceiling." ""</seg>

<seg id="1938">The strongly armored dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators and used a shielding technology known as counterparts that is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have allowed to blend better in its surroundings and avoid its enemies, say experts, which indicates that it was threatened by bigger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the family of the Nodosaurs took first headlines in May and is now at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>

<seg id="2019">How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to their core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Just one day after being arrived in New York City, those in St. Louis sat on the bed of an Airbnb apartment, which they rented and scrolling through Facebook on their phone.</seg>

<seg id="2031">There were photos of the police band and people, the cried out, and by a man who claimed to be a sign with the wording: "Fergusons police have just killed my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">They watched a live feed in which a policeman has stood before a group of demonstrators with a bellish dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">In another video, she said, unsecured a different polizist his rifle and cried: "I will kill you... animals all kill."</seg>

<seg id="2038">They booked a flight back and went home next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After landing at 23 p.m. she took her 6-year-old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two would drive to Ferguson next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the theme of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?" in the cinemas from 11.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a history of survival and protest, of love and loss, strength and resistance, which consists of the point of view of the people living in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">As a Ferrell with her daughter, who ran a cauliftable and a suitable crown, after Ferguson, the two spoke a conversation that they had countless times in this morning "about the black experience and the black condition."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"" "" "" "you remember when I have taught yourself when black people have to fight for that which they believe?" "" "reminded them of what she said." ""</seg>

<seg id="2047">They have to know and see it and be raised in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">It must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also the different layers of the black experience and the black Constitution and what we need to do to freely deliver ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Even though I have the luck to give you an experience in which they personally have no eatant racism, it is not different from the next black women-child.</seg>
<seg id="2050">"" "I feel I would prove her a bad service to keep away from it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2051">The first stop when they arrived in Ferguson was on the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority, which became a Campsite, when the activist on the possible non-indictment of Darren Wilson waited.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There is Ferrell and her daughter connected to a local business owner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared pockets before and halted them to pass on demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly began to take up a new kind of activism for Ferrell's shape.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism has changed after 9 August," she said and notices that she was as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black congregations.</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It is all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later Ferrell met in an evening-demonstration Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-director of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2059">Folayan said, she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to just document "document" what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">"" "a question came to Ferrell in the sense:" "" "do you document or tries to find a story that you can use?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2061">This skepticism was nourished through countless cases of people, often of whites in a community that benefited from their pain and their resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2062">"" "as foayan recently explained in an interview:" "" "we had heard that people who were born in Ferguson and grew up, their voices are not centered and we wanted to do it differently." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan had already worked together with the then Co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the field, which is known for his activism to todestrak inmates.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His involvement brought forth Ferrell the project closer, along with six other locals followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after browsing.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us. we speak" says Davis.</seg>
<seg id="2066">"" "" "" "that was the main thing for me, how these people will be represented, for so will I be represented." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2067">The goal was not to concentrate on Ferrell's experience - to show that it is in the movement "not a Messiah leader, but to a community that comes together," said Folayan - it proved to be the most obvious number of participants in the film.</seg>
<seg id="2068">Consequently, documents of "Whose Streets?" surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, as she loves himself and marries their wife.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and laughed as they saw the finished product for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2070">"" "" "" "but I have understood that there must be a certain accusation in this work and at the revitalisation of black people." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferrabell's history is the role of the black gay women in the wider Black-Lives-Matter Movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of the movement, which after the killing of the black teenager Martin in 2012 have shaped the film "" "" BlacklivesMatter "" "" in social media in 2012, identify themselves as gay. "" "</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have borne the movement in total," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are fighting on different fronts.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Black, gay women must carry the main load of everything. "</seg>
<seg id="2075">"" "Folayan atmospheric to notice that" "" "the movement really is kept by black women and many black women." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2076">"" "however, it insists that" "" "this is not a affirmativer type of action," "" "when Ferrell was chosen as a heart of film." ""</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who stirred this energy," she said.</seg>

<seg id="2079">You can feel their energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">Now, the news cameras in Ferguson have long gone, but the racist connections between the community and the police continue to exist.</seg>

<seg id="2095">Added to the gallery is planned exactly on the property where the peasant market hall is where the 13 direct market will offer its products.</seg>

<seg id="2110">But since there is not even a proper weekend's market here, it is all the more important that we have at least get the Markthalle.</seg>
<seg id="2111">After all, the goods offered there is fresh, is mostly offered directly from the producer and is obfinely inexpensive.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As you can see, shops are rented in a shopping center only by larger companies, because the dormansions are often not portable for a retailer.</seg>

<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping mall with a market hall is not suitable for me.</seg>

<seg id="2124">A suitable similarity: artist creates portrait with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the space of Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white, black and brown, which are almost instrange - that hang on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfers and Hair secular, who were sent to her from Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent out the excerpts from prison in Fort Leavenworth, where the former intelligence service analyst had a 35-year imprisonment, after they made publicly concilted diplomatic messages about the WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition, which was opened on 2 August is called A incoming resemblance (a suitable similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg who united their expertise in technology, computer sciences and arts, and Manning, a Transwife and pioneering Discipled, whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama, when he had only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg has created by the algorithmic analysis of DNA, which could be extracted from the 30 portraits, as someone could look like with this genomic data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inconsistency determinants of these interpretations - but also for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but already since her puberty has spoken openly about the identification as a woman, has been sentenced in 2013 for 20 accusations, including six violations of the SpionageAct, computer and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Because of the prison its picture was oppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a granular, black-white Selfie, in the Manning is visibly unarguably at a driver's seat and a platinblonde Perm carries - with which it was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg was just coming from the great success of their 2012-project 'stranger'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Therein, the artist portrays portraits of stranforic artifacts like cigar mute and chewing gum by extract the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people could look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning, while she was in prison and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg near the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed, so she took contact with Chelsea, and asked if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and their detainted muse were too unequal penpal, which were interchangeable over two years in the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created one of Shoili Kanungo Illustrified Comic "Suppressed Images," which would like to convert a future that would be the President Chloas judgment and it would be able to see the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama was indeed only a few days after the book was published, Manning release was calling for seven brutal years to a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome way of happy-meeting.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also now at the opening of the exhibition something deep and Starkes, since Donald Trump will take a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops in order to find new, tweetently ways to remedy the straining divisions which he actually should fix.</seg>
<seg id="2142">As Dewey-Hagborg after the strange timing of all these things was asked, she said that "things happen from a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In a written artistic statement called on the wall of the gallery, creing with their oversized signature below (the "i" in their surname is provided with a heart) an end to the automatic fragmentation, whose basis was gender, race, sexuality and culture. "</seg>
<seg id="2144">The opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousands of C and GS and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show through the inclusion of 200 letters (or Nuclotides after the highly-developed scientific dictionary of the artist), as surprisingly similar, at least in biological regards, we all are.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully bring about is that our genome is not taking care of who we are and how openly genetic data are for an interpretation and as subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spurious Memories, also to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA" "" "" DNA data can tell so many different stories, therefore the 30 of these stories are "" "." "" "</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a separate room is a page from the above mentioned Comic-Novelle.</seg>
<seg id="2149">It shows creing as they plunge in hand from the disciplinarctic in hand from the disciplinarkasterns of the United States as King-Kong.</seg>

<seg id="2155">That was also focused on how everything was written in the exhibition until the size (5 "2, Manning), in which their genetic paploggroups were written with a pencil.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robot is real and we should worry</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it could not be any more crazy, a new report on technological developments in the area of sex robots.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, actually.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex-robots are currently a great thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robot in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, emeritized professor for Robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we have to begin to take its climb seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye-color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingers.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"" "" "" "people make themselves funny, but the companies deliver lots of it and we will see them much more frequently," "" "said Mr. Sharkey in the publication of his new report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern slabia have developed from their inflatable partners to robotic with a silicon, which feels warm - with conscious human reactions, which are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can adapt its robot accordingly to its beliefs "and choose everything from the eye-color of the robot over the shape of the nipples to the type or colour of his fingers.</seg>
<seg id="2398">"" "but it is still disturbing, as many robots possess the" "" "personalities" "", "which would make a stepford-woman progressive." ""</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern slabia have developed to robots with a silicon.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The real Botix robot allows for example its users to adapt their robots to the properties which they are appealing, such as relentness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is still the Roundxxy Gold Sex-robot with pre-programmed personalities like "Frigid Farrah," which conveys the impression of relentness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as good as possible," warms the website of True Companion.</seg>
<seg id="2403">So you like what you like, and they don't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day they also have their moods - just like true people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "it can be tired, be fixed on conversation or she can be" "" "in mood." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects associated with this rise of sex robot - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the understretched female characteristics, the playability on rape as one is taking a step at Frigid (is here: resisting) Farrah also goes on most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website is True Companion Roxxxy with a vibrator but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men then have no Roxxxy?" is it on the site.</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just a different sex vehicle.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their origin and increasing refinement instruct a little darker and deeper understanding in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for having sex with subjugation as an optional addition.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will of course maintain no sex robot, and while the FRR remarked its growing popularity, they still remain provisional at the edge of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what leased out of the edge-regions, can be in relation to the spirit of time in which we live, very instructive.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or offensive until they give permission to the free market.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is still a certain overcut that these highly developed sex robots in a time emerge when the rights of women are threatened around the world in which there is a president in the White House who have grasped to have women sexually attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The abhorrid aspect of the TV series "The Handmaid's Tale" ('The Report of the Magd') are not the graphical images that impeeled body and the spread-wise eyes, but how realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a jump, but in the moment this does not feel like a great leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The target behind these sex robot is to make a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (if also with Pornostar-proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want to feel human and that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"" "but, brought to the point when it comes to its" "" "personalities" "", "the robots represent no real women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot be separate from their companion or just let go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no mediation or a background story, nothing that indicates on independence or anything, which might disturb the imagination of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">In other words, you are fake slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the wiss of 2017: maid</seg>

<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study claims the exact opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, the symptoms of patients could alleviate patients with inflamed intestinal diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition that affects approximately 1.3 million in the US $1.3 million and in the United Kingdom are 300,000, recurring or bloodless diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While those affected are usually advised to alleviate meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers found at the Washingtoner University discovered that the essential amino acid Tryptophan of proteins are contributing to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant intestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, stated that immuncells in the intestine, stated to ensure that harmful microbes, who hide in the food, not penetrate into the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells, which are capable of dissolving inflammation, are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging the tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation, it can result in a inflammatory intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments has been determined that a kind of tolerance-promoting immunocells in mice is found that a particular bacterium bear in its initiates.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs treyptophan - one of the components of proteins - to dissolve the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between a bacterial and lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan had the mice in their food, the more they had from these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and an in tryptophan rich diet tolerant, less inflammatory intestinal worshius promotes if the same system is also in people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The post-doctorate in Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan searched for a kind of immunocell that promotes tolerance as they found out that a group of study powers had such cells, but another group of the same tribe that had been accommodated, but this did not have.</seg>
<seg id="2593">They assumed that the difference had to do with the intestinal microphone of mice - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which usually live in the stomach-intestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The dyes of mice were enrolled DNA sequentially and have been found six bacterial species, which were present in the mice with the immune cells, but without them were missing in the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterilous environment so that they did not lacked the intestinal microbiom and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how the bacteria grow on the immune system, the researchers L. reuteri can grow in a liquid and overled small amounts of fluid without the bacteria - to unripe immune cells that have been isolated from mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed to the tolerant-tolerable cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component has been cleaned out of the fluid, it proved to be an outproduct of the tryptophan-Metabolism that is known as an idol-3-lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers have doubled the amount of tryptophan in the forage of mice, the number of such cells were halved around 50 percent, but if the tryptop.exe have been halved, the number of cells decreased by the half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan declared that people have the same tolerable cells such as mice and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether the Tryptophan-Pproducts from L. reuteri developed the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory intestinal diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2602">"" "she said," "" "the development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote, since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine." ""</seg>

<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen-Report on the abuse of the Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This is the author and historian Michael Hemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the abuse of the Regensburger Domspatzen on the Regensburger Domspatzen continues for discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weiske, spokesman of the reform movement "We are Church," stated after the publication of the earlier Regensburger Bishop and today's Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year brother of the emerious Pope Benedict XVI, an excuse.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would serve the prestige of the Catholic Church, when Müller and Ratzinger would express her deep regret about his own omissions or her at that time incorrect assessment of the proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"" "the Vatican paper" "" "Osservatore Romano" "", "however criticized that in coverage on violence in the cathedral-cats will be measured with" "" "two digits" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">"" "with regard to the handles in Regensburg, no one is that it would have to be" "" "shameful and shameful deeds" "" "but be striking, but the" "" "medial manipulation" "", "thus the author in Lucetta Scaraffia, historians and member of the National Italian Bioethics committee." ""</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the habit of having the Catholic Church as the source of all evil, is already part of the everyday experience and prepares the public opinion which is for normal to keep it" "" "Scaraffia" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">Also Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis can be found in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk: "you are welcome to the church and this is a tiring freshen."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "moreover, she pointed out that in her youth" "" "blows a quite normal pedagogical means" "" "to be ready with cheeky children as I was one." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">It is unfair to apply today's standards to previous decades, because the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with reports on abuse of abuse often also pope-brother Georg Ratzinger also appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Completely wrongly, says author and historian Michael Hemann, who dealt with Ratzinger the reminder of "My brother of the Pope" (translated into 12 languages).</seg>
<seg id="2902">"" "" "" "I must accept Georg Ratzinger," "" "says Hesemann," "" "for all this had nothing to do with him," "" "he adds the results of the final report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-sided report published by the diocese Regensburg with clarification at the lawyer by Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"" "a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s" "" "with high plautism" "" "victims of attacks, 67 Domspatzen sexually abuses." ""</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report it is said to Georg Ratzinger, which was active from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg: "in summary, it can be kept that from Domkapellmeister were applied in many cases forms of physical and psychic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially with high punctuality, the punishment for the pupils could also be disastrous.</seg>
<seg id="2907">In contrast to numerous other accusations in contrast to numerous other accusations that many victims are the common humanity from R., and therefore even in numerous cases, even in many cases, even positive memories with it. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview Eemann, why the final report on the abuse of the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger was relieved of his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Hemann, the 440-page report on the "Prevention of Nonviolence against protectionery at the Regensburger Domspatzen" is a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">To a stand many students stand out his "humanity."</seg>
<seg id="2911">For the other he also appears as cholestker and perfectionist, which was not a top performance by the Öfteren.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate the biograph this final report?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hemann: once you read the effort and reads the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to be wondering why the name Georg Ratzinger occurs at all in it.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He are just eight pages devoted to him and he is clearly acquitted from every suspicion of the mid- or co-knowing in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Also the nonviolence at the preschool had occurred outside of his own sphere of action.</seg>
<seg id="2916">"" "" "" "you can pre-ject" "" "at best, learn from it too late or have not taken the first hint." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2917">"" "the donate Secondary School on which he worked, was perceived by practically all respondents," "" "Redemption" "", "the sky" "" "and" "" "better world" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"" "thus also the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger describes him an excellent testimony," "" "knowledgeable" "", "" "" "competent" "" "and" "" "understanding" "", "the guys regularly catered with cakes, biscuits and Bonbons and" "" "always covered by grapes of children." ""</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complained about its perfectionist and its high emotional ality, which also led to Wuttah.</seg>
<seg id="2920">That he dined not only with chairs and cast the key federation on the ground, but also eared boys, and too freer guys to the hair or ears, he has already given himself years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it.</seg>
<seg id="2921">To his honorary capacity, however, it must be said that such educations in the questionable period, the 1960s and seventies, were widespread, in parents like with teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding-methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone of us who was born in 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I have also experienced this in a world-wide school, a state school.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what this is actually happening in this report, namely the irreplaceable sexual abuse and nonviolence at the pre-school, are certainly dreamed.</seg>
<seg id="2926">As one already asks herself if it is not more to do with his familiarity and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media has just rushed to him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">"" "" "" "in the Bavarian State, many who have never understood him, still eagerly" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2928">The truth is: the report relieved Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"" "" "" "in the media in connection with the report it reports much about the issue of misuse in the Regensburger Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger was put in the final report also any involution or co-knowing with regard to sexual abuse to the load?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hemann: very clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No single of the 67 victims of sexual taps claims to become familiar with the tkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I never dared to speak with my father or mother about it," "" "said a subject of subject for the others," "" "It was all very embarrassing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem with the enlightenment of sexual abuse was and is that most victims were silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they unfamiliar with parents and siblings, then certainly not a choral manager, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the cathedral-cats make their role in regard to abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hemann: a respondent student formed it so: "regarding sexual abuse... I don't see a case in which he would have had the right knowledge (Georg Ratzinger) and could have stopped the respective offenders.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I consider it... also for really absurd to accept that to be reckoned to him... Bubs become more urgent or more definite, or even more likely to have opened than against their parents, internatsexecutives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That you speak to him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "thus, the report comes to the very clear result:" "" "that in the preliminary student and / or their environment, could not be confirmed within the framework of the examination." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">What sexual abuse concerns, Georg Ratzinger is therefore freeing from any co-knowing.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Thus, he cannot be thrown at him, nor did it prevent or have brought it to the ad.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore there is no reason to associate his good name with these contradictory crimes, as unfortunately it was in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "in the media a lot of" "" "Nonviolence" "" "was to read in the Regensburger Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is thrown out in the report. "</seg>
<seg id="2947">Must he live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hemann: this is the big problem that in the coverage everything was mixed and mixed up to a huge melange from sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, in the middle of Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is precisely the abuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">There will be clean separately: between the pre-school and the Gymnasium of the cathedral-cats, between sexual abuse and violence as well as, we say once, other offences.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report was dealt with incidents from time since 1945, thus also for four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not choral leader of the cathedral-cats.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole horrible test education, the cases, in which Knaben of sadistical teachers were deceived, and amongst them, unattended all at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where actually scandalous states have to prevail.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with those of whom Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boy first to face when they were already on the Domspy Secondary School.</seg>
<seg id="2954">On what was the most witnesses emphasise, the theme of "pre-school" tabu.</seg>
<seg id="2955">It was only happy to escape you and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "heavenly" statuses.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different in the forecourse of the cathedral?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hemann: there was already discipline, but there was no savical violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"" "and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report comes to the conclusion that" "" "many victims put the general humanity from R., and therefore even in numerous cases despite violence even positive memories with it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2959">And so at most remains the accusation that have taken away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">However, despite all efforts, the report was able to define only two periods in which it was reported from the states at the pre-school.</seg>
<seg id="2961">For the first time in 1970 / 71, when he had just begun to establish himself and was responsible for the events at a school, where he was not working and responsible (so the witness) did not want to hear, and then again to 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Gloss Georg Ratzinger in front of the states consistently the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hemann: no, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Doma Secondary School, which even reproduces the report.</seg>
<seg id="2964">In this he pointed out this point that in the pre-school the audit will continue to be investigated. "</seg>
<seg id="2965">Even considering the danger of negative press-public opinion, he recommended urgent objections.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was of course at a time when legal clarity existed, when auditors were long forgotten in Bavaria too.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before, they uncovered themselves in a legal grayzone like everyone of us still knows.</seg>
<seg id="2968">There was hard to estimate for him where the affected might be exaggerated or dramatized and where really the permitted border had been exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But one can not say, he had always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the auditance of schools was officially completed in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">"" "" "" "Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis" "" "yes" "", "it is unfair to apply the current educational standards at that time." ""</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see it?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hemann: we were talking of historian since the "" "" fall of Anachronism "" "," thus the risk of judging the past and today's moral standards. "" "</seg>
<seg id="2975">The intercystine has already right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this is of course not true of sexual abuse, which at all times abominally and also not for what was broken in the pre-school of adversity and violence against innocent children's seams, which already goes far beyond what was then practicing.</seg>
<seg id="2977">That is all completely awful and I am glad that it is finally reworking.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I must accept Georg Ratzinger, for all that had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Its means of disciplining and punishment, so earring and pull in hair and ears were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">As physical constancy then it has been prohibited, he has also strictly adhered to it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">Which picture of his rainy season has Georg Ratzinger because in conversation with you for the book "My brother of the Pope" reproduced?</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did you examine the topic also in the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, therefore Pope Benedict XVI, told his perspective, as the cathedral-cats played only a secondary role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I do not dismiss that he conducted a stricter regime there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But that has to be said once again: without these perfectionist discipline, it would probably have been possible to form an institution of cattrang, true cultural reflections of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and Bonbons alone, one alone makes no big singers and stand before each success, just in which area, however always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people have you experienced by Georg Ratzinger amongst the talks about her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hemann: through the work on the book and beyond, I have seen Georg Ratzinger really well and again and again experienced as wonderful, humorous, basic necessities, deep glitated and heart of good people, of which you could not imagine that he could also just be able to read a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I am regularly coming with how many former Domspatzen still today, 23 years after his trial, regularly contact him, read him to read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of their family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">"" "" "" "those who have not forgive him today that he once was strictly speaking to them are clearly in the minority." ""</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most Domspatzen are today grateful to him that he enriches their lives and brought them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he is always a good, father's teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovable respect to which they still look and to honor them.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once again clearly, everything you preset to it are guardians methods that were at that time on the order of the day.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad we have overcome this time long ago.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is highly unjust, a man, just because he is prominently and has an even more prominent brother to make a medial scapsway.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the nasty purpose behind it, just too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">For the report, which was just published, relieved him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the attendant has been acquired, a 93-year-old man who has acquired great merits and without the outside Bayerns and perhaps Germany probably no one would know the Regensburger Domspatzen (finally in peace).</seg>
