Jennifer Ani@@ ston : I always put in drawers
Jennifer Ani@@ ston must not always be perfect or successful .
this made clear the Hollywood star in an interview now un@@ ambiguous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will always put up in drawers or glu@@ ed outside the label that usually have little to do with me and the reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I myself do not have the desire to always be perfect and successful . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; frank@@ ly speaking , these things are more likely to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jennifer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only lau@@ ght that she is considered &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as described in the current &quot; Cos@@ m@@ opol@@ itan &quot; section .
at most loved the act@@ ress spends her time at home , vor@@ m television with lo@@ cker@@ em Dut@@ y and Mexican food , is it in the magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to the White Re@@ vers@@ aries , they bring the question of the children &apos;s desire : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we women must not be married or have children to be perfect &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so the Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in her new film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a children &apos;s game &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is Ani@@ ston to see an al@@ rede@@ mp@@ ing mother of two sons . &quot; &quot; &quot;

gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the Sport@@ pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
at the end of a golf tur@@ ni@@ ers in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger searched with some colleagues a bit of variety with a horseback ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; Golden Sport@@ pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes the horses were reminded of their celebrations , they hun@@ ted in the fast Gal@@ lo@@ p home to the feed @-@ animals .
one kilometer at this pace , I have dre@@ amed of fear .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger .
and thus the riding career ended up again already again .
on Saturday Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fers of all times - 101 tournament victories - back close to horses .
he left himself with his family about the plant of the AL@@ RV , on a horse , he didn &apos;t care for photographers .
this was the first time in Aachen , and thus also with the CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German spor@@ tive over@@ hau@@ led the man from An@@ hausen in the context of a small Gala the Gol@@ dene Sport@@ pyramid .
awards were not lacking to the symp@@ athetic ath@@ lete .
Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreu@@ z , sil@@ ber@@ nes Lor@@ be@@ er@@ blatt , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the Year ...
even the British Queen has already rehear@@ sed him .
long is the 18th @-@ winner of the Sport@@ pyramid .
in Aachen , he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for it is not only given for sporting achievements , but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades Lan@@ ger has promoted the offspring .
and so he was also the prize money of 25,000 euro in the same way .
with 15 other outstanding sports@@ men , the two @-@ fold U.S. mast was taken on Saturday in the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports . &quot;
among the excellent products the athle@@ tics Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the hostess Corn@@ elia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ us@@ ch and Ar@@ sty Schmit@@ t , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the Spring@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the Spring@@ e@@ Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um of the palm of all Erhard .
many of these sports were arrived on Saturday after Aachen .
after the official part hi@@ ked the illustr@@ ative company into the Spring@@ stadium , where the Lav@@ azza was running .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept a distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ ics and Tru@@ mp@@ s economic policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and avoid the T@@ TP trade agreement - these are both Clinton and Tru@@ mp .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the two US presidential resources are however in the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
differences in economic policy between Donald Tru@@ mp and Hill@@ ary Clinton is a prin@@ cipl@@ ed , rather philosophical difference .
the , on the role of the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp wants to keep in doubt rather small and war@@ ns on how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton wants to regulate the economy to death and to regulate death , he says .
on the contrary , it would be quite different from the contrary , claims Tru@@ mp .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will massi@@ vely rest@@ rain regul@@ ators and he makes himself strong for far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton , on the other hand , says : the state has certain tasks to perform , it has severe dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money for it .
therefore , the taxes for the rich , says it .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the subject of infrastructure .
in the need to be invested , Tru@@ mp and Clinton are almost in@@ ju@@ red .
the democratic applicant announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes in the infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the nation@@ als Te@@ y@@ y @-@ wing of the Republi@@ can .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , at Tru@@ mp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we could also get im@@ partial discussions on tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the differences in energy and climate policies are more evident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp wants to build coal power plants and re @-@ driven coal production in the US again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
oil promotion should also be possible in so far protected areas , the Paris mi@@ tigation agreement wants to announce it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton , on the other hand , intends to expand its renewable energies with its investment program and calls for : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a country will create the super@@ power of clean energy and create millions of jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it will probably be China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot;
but not only in the infrastructure - also in international trade agreements , the two cont@@ enders are not too far from each other .
T@@ PP , the tran@@ ac@@ itative trade deal , they do not want to sign .
at the same time , both of them do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade , but just to better protect American jobs .
the ones to be paid better then calls for example Clinton .
the present minimum wage of 7.@@ 25 US dollars is a hunger compensation .
she wants to raise it on 15 dollars per hour .
what Tru@@ mp does not want to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage has to r@@ ally , then he says he should not be changed .
but the large discussion of the coming months might be likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand is Tru@@ mp , who wants to rel@@ ieve the economy and citizens to boost growth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his critics keep him before , so that the budget deficit would be even bigger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , Clinton , who at least demand from the rich , that they will pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution .
escape : &quot; every man @-@ fle@@ dged woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence belongs to women , who alone may flee , almost always to everyday life .
when they arrive in Germany , they are often traum@@ atis@@ ed .
a house offers refuge .
in a large kitchen there are four women .
each has a baby here , which is at most one year old .
one has put her little son into the arm .
he was curious with big eyes curious into the room .
his mother star@@ ters on the table plate .
until they noticed that they will be observed .
she sm@@ iles short and kiss@@ ed the little ones .
the scene works normal .
until one speaks with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is the business manager of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a sponsor for social assistance in Bavaria , and among other things focuses on the subject of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen were wing@@ ed .
they live in the course of Munich in one of the few de@@ centr@@ alised accommodation for ever @-@ fle@@ ed women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs set up the establishment together with Pro Familia and Mün@@ chner Women &apos;s aid .
recently , it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men do not exist - also not as visitors .
the exception is a guard on the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : any woman who arrives here , has done on their flight experiences with sexual violence , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee for wars because they are politically per@@ sec@@ uted , because they thre@@ aten torture or death , or because their families send them as hop@@ per to Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in women , there were some other reasons for the escape : &quot; many ste@@ al secre@@ tly because they see no other way out . &quot;
in their homeland they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , honorary , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
it is driving them away .
on the run goes on .
&quot; that tu@@ gs for example demand a bottle of water a sexual act is not r@@ arity , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who believe that as soon as they anchor in Germany , ir@@ re , says B@@ ahr .
even here all @-@ standing women in refugee camps are often considered inferior and worst if ab@@ used .
this leads to that about 90 percent of women living in the North of Munich , traum@@ atis@@ ed , appreci@@ ates them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children certainly did not come up voluntarily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women were so used to say nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they don &apos;t trust openly to speak about the experiences , because the shame is too great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often don &apos;t have to help to be kiss@@ ed , there are more accommodations only for them , calls for danger .
in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for placing refugees .
on the question whether they would like to bet by a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction , some will respond with no .
in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken approximately there are so something in accommodations among the governments .
also in Schw@@ aben alone women are not rus@@ hed out alone , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , Pres@@ ses@@ pre@@ cher of the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Central fran@@ ken there are some common apartments of floors or their own houses only for single women and their children .
the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rights of women and gender equality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be accommod@@ ated separately from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study that was published for the Committee , it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women can be separated separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lacks the privacy or will come together for men and women , it may be - on @-@ going - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the wash@@ rooms should be separated and accessible for women , stands in the study .
how much the women of this protective needs can be felt at the con@@ ges@@ tion to put it on the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since you have been dealing with us , we have a long queue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you could easily set up a second house .
general practitioner : demands for new labour @-@ fighting measures
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dep@@ uty general assistance to help people call their trade union to respect new labour measures with their dispute concerning a new contract . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Junior Do@@ ctors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) demanded his entire advice , beginning of September more labour measures .
the J@@ DC said that ministers had given birth to enter into the concerns of the contract .
assistance and medi@@ tations have agreed in July about the rejection of a contract agreed with BM@@ A .
it was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted in the elections .
in a letter to the members , who was published on Thursday evening on Twitter , the president of the J@@ DC , Mc@@ Court , that the government was &quot; persistent &quot; to problems , which led to the fact that the treaty was rejected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; given this has voted the J@@ DC to complete the proposed new contract and requested new negotiations for all these hear@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Board has today set up a formal application for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council , in order to escal@@ ate a running programme of escal@@ ating labour measures , beginning of September .
the disputes led to that Assi@@ stance in this year was sixteen strikes , the first total inci@@ dents in the history of the N@@ HS .
the director of the BM@@ A Assi@@ stance Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana entered the decision of the ref@@ usal of the agreed contractual conditions that had been recommended by the BM@@ A .
he shared BM@@ A members during meetings , which were still carried out before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 Assi@@ stance and Medi@@ z@@ inst@@ ud@@ ent , with that the agreement should be advantageous and accepted .
after the vote , the Minister of Health Minister Jerem@@ y Hunt is said that the contract for physicians to be introduced in England .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; Alliance of External Side &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended up a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give the hands of the hands and to proclaim the official end of the eight months to the long lasting war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counter at the golden Hall of St. Petersburg &apos;s Palace , I cannot deny myself to the expression that Ankara wants to do this reconciliation .
there was the hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s sm@@ iles real and he pointed barely warmth , even for his back @-@ loving relationships .
Rec@@ ep Tayy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , spoke repeatedly by his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report all five times .
I could no longer count it .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to its old levels before the crisis , but can even be improved .
the next day describing a newspaper that Erdo@@ gan would have heard so would never happen anything .
to me this enthusiasm seemed to imply the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s radiant , sustainable cooling showed that the state of Russia had nothing to forget .
rather the cause of the crisis was the first what he mentioned in his introductory words : the shot of a Russian fighter plane to the Syrian border by Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was dropped .
Putin told him and accused Ankara to please Russia in the back .
the promise was even bigger , as it was committed by a friend .
the Vet@@ rau@@ d can rebuild it becomes difficult , if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
months long the state @-@ controlled media resulted in a severe , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
at once it seemed to be the Turks to blame for everything .
the accus@@ ations of senior officials , that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family had benef@@ ited from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria , which should be controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he has denied this v@@ eh@@ ement .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message showed that it was time to look forward .
finally , this meeting was only held because Putin received an excuse from President Erdo@@ gan who he wanted to hear .
Russia was able to book a kind of victory .
for Ankara the advantages of a cease @-@ fire are obvious .
Erdo@@ gan is primarily needed all the friends that he can get , after spending last month by a failed government at almost his office .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sha@@ ken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights , which usually bring several millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be facilitated when the flights are picked up again .
you are counting on a bel@@ low season of the Mediterranean .
this week progn@@ os@@ ti@@ zed the state @-@ TV cheaper fruits and vegetables , once the Turkish agr@@ arian imports will be restored .
a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti formed it as follows : &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry at the West because the reaction to the tried power of power was seen as a weak response .
this continued tre@@ ll about the sn@@ ail of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the awakening to it from the cool mood and reduce the relationship between Turkey to the West .
Russian State @-@ head won in Ankara with certainty a bonus for having tried at the state of state aid for elected government organs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is well @-@ evident in Moscow that has a self @-@ confidence which has changed even a deeper fear of regime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the summit meeting in this beautiful palace on the sea made it possible Russia and Turkey , one how it used to me an analy@@ tic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : two countries that have gone out from the West and have now fully resolved . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , despite public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two countries .
the greatest differentiation is Syria , where Moscow recently gave the role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support contradi@@ ct@@ ory pages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could be significant that after nearly three hours of first talks both Presidents met at the press conference , that they didn &apos;t even grasp the subject . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the President of Turkey refused to answer a question about their differences , while Putin decided to stress this .
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect dis@@ aster , when the NATO member of Turkey broke the Russian combat jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State had at least talk to each other again .
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland is no longer available
the R@@ BS brand shall also be reduced to a back@@ board role according to the board of the Bank .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland .
R@@ oss Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland with that the R@@ BS brand share with the global ambitions of the bank .
the Bank has since dist@@ anced itself since they had almost collap@@ sed and saved from eight years ago .
at this time bran@@ ding &quot; R@@ BS &quot; used to protect other end@@ consumer goods .
they supported international sports with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ing , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to the Wimbledon winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now she has decided to push more national brands into the focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centralized headquarters and the IP@@ O will change to Nat@@ West .
Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other , smaller brands for retail store , which will receive more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Drum@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a meeting tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the RS@@ B brand will be dedicated to our investor brand and brand , among which our employees will be employed as we now become more of a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS was transformed into a global brand .
I say now that we do not pursue global goals , but pursue local goals .
each of these marks will be completely different in their own communities and our employees will work under these brands with the customers .
R@@ BS has already announced that it will no longer continue its six Nations sponsorship contract and that it will increase percep@@ ti@@ bility of the various brands in its sports sponsorship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s time for us to develop to the bank of the brands as we are in the inner ( we have asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cally three years ago , if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and had launched these marks .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can re @-@ compile these brands , therefore I think that the time has come .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori reaches his 3.@@ 000@@ th profit in New@@ market with New@@ market
D@@ ett@@ ori spra@@ ying champagne after a double with New@@ market , which brings him 3,@@ 000@@ th profit
the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori safest on Friday its 3,@@ 000@@ th British profit at New@@ market .
he sat on Pre@@ vention , that is trained by John Gos@@ den , on his local race track with his second win of the night a milestone .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italians is the sixth Jo@@ ckey which reaches the milestone in the flat race .
he follows Sir Gordon Ri@@ chards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ god , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Willi@@ e Car@@ son .
the three @-@ month winner D@@ ett@@ ori that won before him on G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar said , &quot; It is something special . &quot;
I am very emotional , because my family is here too
I am very happy about it , that it came to happen at New@@ market because I am here thirty years ago .
it is not a big meeting , it is not Royal As@@ cot - it is a ban@@ aler Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes the che@@ ers when he got the victory on Pre@@ ek@@ ction
two Jo@@ ck@@ eys have reached the milestone in obstacles - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y who reached over 4,@@ 300 victories in a re@@ fr@@ aming career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ god , the nine @-@ time Der@@ b@@ ysi@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 care@@ ers
Frank@@ ie is one of the best Jo@@ ckey of the modern age and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone within few years ago .
he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intel@@ le@@ ct that differs from the others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic Ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and char@@ ism fans around for years for this sport .
I said Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already fet@@ ched 6,000 wins if he was not just a weekend and big tur@@ ni@@ er@@ yo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie has already been lucky in the UK for nearly 30 years , which is great .
he has a vibrant personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an incredible Jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the fig@@ ure@@ head of the British empire for two decades .
it was nerve @-@ wr@@ acking .
a whole series of wholes@@ aler win , including its famous &quot; glorious Si@@ eben &quot; 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and got a drug ban .
three years ago , he initially had difficulties when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive characteristic force to de@@ activate his branches and to return to its stock .
and he &apos;s not yet at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori said once again that he wants to continue for competitions until his or at least 5@@ 0.@@ ten years .
Russian Putin feudal , Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
the Russian President Vladimir Putin has released unexpected his staff , Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was a number of years of tru@@ sts of confidence of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed for special officer for environmental and transport affairs .
in an opinion of Kre@@ m@@ lin it is that Putin without giving reasons &quot; the dis@@ mis@@ sal Ivan@@ ov ordered of his duties as chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been appointed Ivan@@ ov since 2012 was appointed to his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is former diplom@@ at .
1972 was born in the Est@@ onian capital city of Tallinn , he made his gradu@@ ation at the renowned State of Moscow for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo .
on the Kre@@ m@@ lin website it is ( in Russian ) that he later became a director and leader of the government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said about his appointment he said to Putin , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as a state of state aid and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin told Russian TV Chann@@ els on Friday with that Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post and V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convince the most ridic@@ ulous faces ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov was a long time of one of the closest trust@@ worthy Vladimir Putin and works like him for the Soviet intelligence service , the K@@ GB .
as a staff , he was one of the most powerful men of the country .
at a meeting with President Putin that was broad@@ cast@@ ed on television , both men said that the staff can withdraw his own wish .
but despite the sm@@ iles for the cameras , here are few of them convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
so here is the result of a kind of power struggle ?
this is currently no one knows .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the official claim - that a man who was once challenged as a potential president , would like to direct the Russian environmental policy - came across great scep@@ ticism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in his comments on Putin who quoted on the Kre@@ m@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - you could almost say - compl@@ aining about four years long ago .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months .
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December 2011 .
he previously was Deputy Minister and Defence Minister .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin former member of State Security Service K@@ GB .
in the late 1990s , when Putin appointed Chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his dep@@ uty .
when Putin addressed the power he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people he most trusted .
it once was assumed that Ivan@@ ov could be president of Russia as a third presidential term Putin would violate the constitution .
but this post was taken by another , approaching ally Putin , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became prime minister , before he became president three and a half years later .

puzzles for fish , which landed in garden in Ban@@ ff
a resident of Ban@@ ff asked for the identification of the fish , who appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks that it could act on the 75 fish around Sand@@ a@@ ale , which were split by a fountain .
Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published on Per@@ is@@ cope a video of the spectacle in hope that somebody could throw some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish .
Queens@@ boro Cros@@ sing : bridge now related to Fi@@ fe
the £ 1,@@ 35 billion expensive project will be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the Nord@@ deck of the que@@ fied Cros@@ sing with the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now connected with fever .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four stages of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cover &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which approach each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ ves is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 Sch@@ rä@@ g@@ rop@@ es .
the £ 1,@@ 35 billion expensive project is to be completed by May 2017 .
Minister K@@ eit@@ h Brown took a visit to the site today and was one of the first to go to the bridge from the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the que@@ fied cros@@ strainer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witnesses of a engineers at a truly ep@@ ic size in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel , which were used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the closure between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a tricky activity which require extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit .
overall , almost 79 % of the whole bridge at its place and the last section of the Dec@@ ks gets today in Ros@@ y@@ th a Bet@@ ong@@ ation for the deck , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place .
Michael Martin , Project Manager of For@@ th Cros@@ sing Bridge Constru@@ ctors said : &quot; the first decision is a significant milestone in each bridge project .
this fantastic project represents the tr@@ end@@ setting of tr@@ end@@ setting and deep building .
after installing the last tram section and its connection with the North Tower deck , we had to close the still existing gap on the north or country side .
this was reached by dra@@ gging of the northern fe@@ eder bridge 700 milli@@ metres south .
this was a massive and at the same time very sensitive activity .
massi@@ vely , since the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 222 meters long , about 6,000 tons , and at an incl@@ ine of about 3 % had to be drawn up .
hei@@ oli , since the toler@@ ances that the team works , tiny - on each side they ru@@ ined only a few millimeters .
fortunately everything went very well .
rescue at the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; happiness still alive &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; happiness still alive &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; after they were thrown out of their fishing boat before fro@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI lif@@ ebo@@ at station cutting on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T alarm after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had trouble swim in safety while driving her boat from their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw how the boat turned around and placed us the worst before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head of the lif@@ ebo@@ at station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank@@ fully , the strong winds is already blow@@ n by boat until we left water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were res@@ cu@@ ed by a local fishing boat while the third man was exhausted from the age of 60 and was found on a Bo@@ je without life@@ jacket .
they all came aboard the coastal boat boots and were brought back to the lif@@ ebo@@ at station
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men who were cast into the water have luck un@@ released and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boot motor although it had a stop@@ pers , however , this sol@@ dering himself from the pot of the bot of the person , which controlled the boat .
someone has known today about these males .
heavy hurt - man ste@@ cht on his ex @-@ friend
a man has attacked his ex @-@ friend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and badly hurt .
as the police rus@@ hed yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had given the keys to the apartment to get his personal things .
instead , the hop@@ eless offen@@ ders of his ex @-@ friend .
when he came into the apartment , he went twice to her twice .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was in@@ ju@@ red by hand and body .
the police could hold the perpetrators .
during the 50 @-@ year @-@ old the clothes destroyed his ex @-@ friend , he called his mother .
this alar@@ ming then was his sister .
together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to put their brother cal@@ med .
but she could not move him to leave the apartment .
therefore she went out of the house with her partner .
on the road they met the ex @-@ partner of the man .
when the two women bet@@ ting@@ ed the apartment again , the ub@@ est of the 50 @-@ year @-@ old his sister to the side and handle his ex @-@ friend .
who is building up @-@ to @-@ date apartments ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and Gre@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; investors should be much stronger in the future in future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how does one react to bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 cheap apartments in the next few years ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is propos@@ ing a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; action concept &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but stri@@ fe is programmed .
first and foremost it is about the question : who is supposed to build the cheap apartments ?
a provision is not lacking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD spokes@@ man Christoph Brat@@ mann says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build urban areas in future must show 20 percent of all apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cheap apartments can also be developed in the stock .
the great issue in the town hall is , however , as viol@@ a : &quot; how do you deal with investors to build on private surfaces ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build investors on such areas at least 10 percent , but as as as possible 20 per cent of the apartments are building as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new urban construction utility program that will cost millions and still need to be financed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , as viol@@ a : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is currently no agreement between the political groups . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U wants to make investors as few rules as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the left does not want to have tough@@ ness for investors .
whatever its , so viol@@ a , a shar@@ pen@@ ing of the situation in the housing market .
the action concept is implemented , it will provide for additional tasks in the building management .
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we are getting the professionals .
but the program is not entirely different : because the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
but how do you compare the loss of further about 1300 cheap apartments whose funding will run over the next few years ?
only up to 2020 will be 500 apartments .
to prevent this , so the planning @-@ policy speaker at Nicole Palm , should now be bu@@ ked out of the city now .
furthermore , it should be thought to get apartments back into the price binding .
this is possible in the Western city .
there is a blow to solve the problem .
because in the west city the dates are for the end of the year .
around 1800 flats you could get back to the discounts for cheap apartments .
only : they want the owners , the housing companies not .
because the number of social housing in the western city is dramatically increased , it is removed from the objective of so @-@ called mixing .
a concentration of social weak in just a few neighborhoods should not give it any more .
the Gre@@ ens expect that there will be further movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; leader of the Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a broad majority it must be the CD@@ U into the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this has concentrated on more building pitches for family dwell@@ ings .
but what does not mean that a compromise may not be found yet .
Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness , worth it
it is fascinating to watch how the world changes .
that teenage boys and child will no longer go outside but rather prefer to spend their leisure time on screens , has been lam@@ med over the last decade of many .
on Po@@ k@@ em@@ on Go is about getting people from the sofa to get more active and more active .
the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then on video games and finally on smartphones .
therefore it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive .
I refer to the Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that is based on the characters which were initially created for the video games in the 1990s ( later , resulting from a cartoon , game cards and other spin @-@ off@@ s ) .
like many phenomena of the population , the interest in the publication of the game sank in the US , Australia and New Zealand in early July .
the market launch in other countries was postponed by massive demand that over@@ load the server .
within a few days Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and nearly as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , the players go outside with their smartphones and look for Po@@ k@@ é@@ m@@ ons that are tr@@ acked with a GPS and once they were found , &quot; photographed &quot; ( via a scre@@ enshot on the phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was still younger , joined the W@@ ahn and sp@@ rang out for the search of the sofa .
in the United States , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that puts the &quot; average &quot; person every day .
Car@@ di@@ o@@ gram , an app for Apple Watch , the 3@@ 5.000 users re@@ per@@ sec@@ uted , the Washington Post recently concluded that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of per@@ sec@@ uted people who j@@ umped every day 30 minutes , from 45 percent to 53 per cent .
the company doesn &apos;t know who plays Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go - it only looks the raw data for an increase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many public awareness campaigns to health that people want to take &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take 30 minutes of time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; walk from the sofa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyday at de@@ af ears , because many public messages are boring to health and come from people that look forward . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the importance of sport can not be evaluated .
anyone who drives regularly sport , reduces its chances to protest to cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here .
but the wonderful thing about Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
thus , three pillars of health covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
some people even join the hunt even new friend@@ ships .
as always , there are also m@@ ex@@ pedi@@ atric toys , who must always complain about something .
and yes , someone could walk against a door .
what should it be ?
it has become a breakthrough .
even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit already were able to trace our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to do sport as it does this game .
the new will lose its charm and use it with time .
because of Po@@ k@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success , however , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ist in the real world and help many people in the hunt to be active , f@@ itter and healthier .

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the dam
forget the pressure .
forget the h@@ ype .
Simone Bil@@ es is on all the im@@ mu@@ n .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ less on the beam .
breathtaking on the ground .
on an entire line brilliant .
and now finally the Olympi@@ ans .
the 19 @-@ year American gymn@@ ast er@@ kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday to the surplus title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the head@@ lamps of the Olympic Games .
its entire result from 6@@ 2.@@ 198 was clearly marked in front of the Silver med@@ alli@@ sts and &quot; Final Five &quot; -@@ Mann@@ er@@ kam@@ er@@ ad@@ in A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian Bronze Medal for Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
the Americ@@ an@@ ers Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ nt on the pig @-@ beams of women in the event of art during the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American , who wins a multi @-@ fight title and the fifth , while she is consoli@@ dating her call , the best of their generation or even at all .
she broke out in tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment found an end .
this success in the same league will put them into the same league as Michael P@@ helps who have brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es dominated the last three years of their sport , 15 world med@@ alli@@ ons - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals and precision that the Olympics of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u b@@ ail@@ on from her said that she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast that I have ever seen . &quot;
it was expecting her final exam in Brazil , a competition that was not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a burden over@@ sized expectations .
not having a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas will return , would be regarded as disappointment .
the American Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man re@@ embrace itself after they have won gold and silver in the Sing@@ ers &apos; stand@@ ings at the Olympic Summer 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday ,
Bil@@ es hol@@ te the first medal at the Tuesday , while she served on the f@@ arewell party who served in retirement team of Mann@@ er@@ coordin@@ ator Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a fe@@ ather @-@ mark .
although Bil@@ es insi@@ sted , during their long way@@ point to the top , never to have the future planned , this is not really true .
part of her ground exercises - which included their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is tuned to Latin American music that would fit home on the street outside the Olympi@@ ad arena in Rio .
this is not a coincidence .
this girl who was adopted by their grand@@ parents as a small child and was discovered by trainers A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother during a school flight to the gymn@@ asium , in which Bo@@ or@@ man tra@@ ded was used .
it has no more lost since the summer of 2013 , a multi @-@ combat competition , which will last as long as it wishes .
even though Must@@ af@@ ina caused by two turn@@ around , the image has led .
float beams and Bo@@ dent@@ ur@@ ns - in which Bil@@ es stops the world title - lou@@ der .
it came again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the float again - and set up with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground yet .
Ra@@ is@@ man embr@@ aced her gently when she was expecting her grand@@ stand - a pure form of form@@ ality - and tears lie on Bil@@ es shiny red , white and blue E@@ yel@@ iner , as the vision that they were once described in their collection book , to reality .
the power of Ra@@ is@@ mans was a re@@ venge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medals in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke went to Must@@ af@@ ina .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this time the 22 @-@ year team capital was named by the Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ ma &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after their ground level they threw the audience to the audience , overwhelmed by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed du@@ bi@@ ous .
as for what it concerns , the rapidly spread T@@ we@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old from the beginning of this week has a completely new meaning :
police : 3 victims in series @-@ cases when playing music is shot in the car
according to police report that were published on Thursday were two women and a 12 @-@ year old girl shot in one of the most deadly attacks since a decade in the first serial port of Phoenix , while they stopped in the car and listened to music .
Angela Rochelle Liner , Stef@@ anie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot at the 12th of June , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ v@@ eway , the authorities said .
the perpetr@@ ator had eight shots from a hand fire weapon , while he stood on the passenger side of the car and then fled by another vehicle , is read in the report .
the police shared with that the thre@@ e@@ fold murder did not seem to be the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y , as the Att@@ acker did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , who found themselves in possession of one of the adult victims .
the pol@@ ze@@ is@@ pre@@ cher von Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the s@@ laugh@@ ing the investig@@ ator led to become a closer look at whether it is connected to four previous attacks .
altogether , predominantly in h@@ isp@@ anic dwell@@ ings were killed in nine months in nine months and two more viol@@ ates .
&quot; it happens in a residential neighborhood in front of a house , &quot; shared Howard of K@@ H@@ PO , an affiliate of CB@@ S , beginning of the month .
it is assumed that the susp@@ ects several vehicles has used , including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the investig@@ ators initiated the evidence that they have taken to the conclusion that attacks are linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ellis , 33 , has been hospit@@ alized because of their injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on the spot .
a witness to the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities published also a police report on the shal@@ e , which took off on an empty pickup truck for half an hour before the triple murder and is assumed that it was the work of the mass mur@@ derer .
investig@@ ators found pat@@ ron@@ y@@ sle@@ eves and secured a sphere from the seat as well as ball @-@ frag@@ mente from the motor room .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cep@@ halia : &quot; it gets better &quot;
as most 6 @-@ year @-@ old loves Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to the singing , toys and of course his mother .
but as the least of his retirement has Ed@@ mund Micro@@ cep@@ halia , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to during her pregnancy did not know anything .
when he came home for the first time , my first thought I didn &apos;t manage this .
I do not manage this .
I did not let myself down .
what is not true at all -- of course one has left itself on it , &quot; she said .
her husband Vincent and her was told that Ed@@ mund can never be recognized under circumstances and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they smote him to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first answer to it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I did not know that people still do &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed@@ mund can run by means of a wal@@ ker .
Ed@@ mund was unable to sit down until his third age of life , and he can still not speak .
but he slowly makes progress .
it can run with support and cycle .
he loves to play with his two brothers and sing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elizabeth shows the string , that Ed@@ mund for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Please sing something in front of &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bring him sign language , &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to CB@@ S News .
but it is not a typical string -- says it . Ed@@ mund has invented some signs alone .
micro@@ cep@@ halia has a variety of causes : genetic as with Ed@@ mund as well as infections with viruses like mas@@ on or the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of infected with the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to is remin@@ is@@ cent of the emotional price of a certain future .
I always asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still does not know .
I haven &apos;t been asked for the progn@@ osis for a long time because I don &apos;t expect that someone can truly say to me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hope@@ ful advice for mothers of inf@@ ants with birth threads caused by the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
it gets better .
you know that it will become better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .

severe rain @-@ cases and large @-@ scale floods in Lou@@ isi@@ ana sets the governor , on Friday the emergency stop . it is calculated all Saturday with more ra@@ inf@@ all .
numerous rivers in the southeast of Lou@@ isi@@ anas and the south of the Hi@@ pp@@ is floo@@ ded their banks and dro@@ ught with large @-@ scale floods from extreme ra@@ inf@@ all , reported the National weather service .
the Gover@@ nor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John Bel Ed@@ wards shared with that state officials are standing in constant contact with local authorities and is already on the road to the concerned congregations .

ste@@ els said that alone the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a ten thousand sand@@ bags would have requested .
a flood warning system is used across large parts in the South Lou@@ isi@@ ana until Saturday .
the Wetter@@ dienst suggested that additional 3 to 5 inches in the area could drop out of rain in this area .
in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama the Friday was used on Friday , while it was still ra@@ ined in the area of Mobile .
the River Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the River Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , which are located both in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will all probability be reached over the weekend .
the Met@@ ere@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could floo@@ ded many houses in the suburbs of Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
he also said that a back@@ wards led floods in Ascension Par@@ ish is a danger , as these are flowing across the feu@@ d rivers into the Lake of Mau@@ rep@@ as .
the river tick@@ fa@@ w , south of the Mississippi border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest stand on Friday already by 09.@@ 00 .
rescue teams still sli@@ pped people from the floods in the district Am@@ ite and Wil@@ k@@ inson in the southwest of Mississippi .
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his son @-@ son found themselves among those who were saved on Friday in the vicinity of Glo@@ ster .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house , overnight heavily .
he said that him was a further stal@@ k , who lives nearby .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we woke up and the water flow and poured out &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my wa@@ ist .
his wife told Hans@@ ford that she lived in the 48 years , where she had never seen such a high point of the river .
Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members would have all the disabilities and he would be the one who can swim .
Hans@@ ford said that N@@ oth@@ el@@ fer had saved all three in a great military truck and had brought them to the next fire@@ guard , where they were accommod@@ ated until Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the floods had spread quickly &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as there were still heavy ra@@ inf@@ alls and that the authorities seek evacu@@ ation instructions into consideration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann , an observer in the vicinity of Liv@@ ing@@ stone held from midnight to Friday tomorrow of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain .
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the soil due to the ra@@ inf@@ alls has been considerably vulnerable since Wednesday .
the authorities believe that heavy ra@@ inf@@ alls and street floo@@ ding the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a par@@ ish and educational , caused in five school districts .
the CB@@ S @-@ subsidiary WW@@ L reported that a passenger @-@ level in Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a 200 floo@@ ded houses .
the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated in two churches which are now both floo@@ ded .
the Vor@@ steh@@ er of the municipality of Rob@@ by Mill@@ er said that the authorities have saved 72 people and seven pets that were r@@ ins@@ ed by the flood .
in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond were appointed emergency accommodation to host the evacu@@ ated evacu@@ ated .
&quot; once the water begins to withdraw , they will be able to go back into their houses , &quot; he said .
in the town of Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a , almost two closed roads were closed due to the flood and made sand bags made for residents to pick up the water that we hope to keep the water from their homes and shops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last big floods that we had , was in March , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
in the tip the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Coun@@ t@@ ys said that it continued on the Gulf coast .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw water in places where I have never seen it before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Town@@ son , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it still comes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; by balls per@@ chert , &quot; survi@@ ves shal@@ e in Philadelphia
the police shares that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week the second time that a 6 @-@ year child is shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for CB@@ S Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grand@@ parents gave to that Brown suffered several car@@ ab@@ bre@@ aches , including in the lungs , leg , arm and belly , but that he was with his transport to the hospital in consciousness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has done much , his small body was smo@@ ked by balls , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shared his grand@@ mother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z to the transmitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just cannot believe it .
the condition of the boy was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the family of the boy shared with the sender , that it is expected to be in@@ ju@@ red again .
he should have started the first class in a local primary school .
brown was one of four people shot in Ger@@ mant@@ own .
also shot three men : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are according to CB@@ S Philadelphia in a stable state .
the boy was found at the front seat of a car along with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who found himself in a critical state , reported the transmitter .
the other two victims were not found in the car and the police find out whether one of the most recent men of the perpetrators are .
investig@@ ators shared CB@@ S Philadelphia with that it seems to be a cross @-@ fire between several sho@@ oters .
pat@@ ron@@ y@@ sle@@ eves for pet@@ ri@@ f@@ le tubes , which have been trac@@ ed to various pet@@ ri@@ ers , over@@ paraly@@ sed the Tat@@ ort .
it seems that this is clearly a struggle for a continual struggle .
on the road , on both sides of walking , there were sle@@ eves .
thus it seems to have given several armed fighters that were very active involved , &quot; shared police officers Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di the police in Philadelphia to the transmitter .
there were also several houses and vehicles taken in the area .
there was no arrest , and the police are currently checking reports according to surveillance video .
on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year girl was struck by a cross @-@ layer on the arm when she played in front of her house in the West Oak Lane .
they recovered and the police are still searching for a susp@@ ects .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I present to me under the Women &apos;s Women &apos;s World War , and that is more than a reason .
first , I have been at every summer Olympics , and the USA had never been so dominant .
and secondly : this team has three turbines , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren , &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , inspired for many young girls of other skin colour .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jü@@ din is and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , which is ca@@ tho@@ lic , round , makes every proud .
this team finally reflects the US .
it has paved the black and h@@ isp@@ anic female presence at the head of this sport .
in the last four years the number one among the female gymn@@ ast was an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American .
last year Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
this shows strength .
at the last Olympic Games we visited Gab@@ by Douglas a surprising Olympics and America .
now , the world was able to be witness to the incredible performance of the triple world in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they were unexpected , but master@@ ful G@@ ym@@ atic routines .
on Thursday Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American , who won gold at an individual multi @-@ fight event for women .
Mann@@ ing member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we are experiencing the top of this sport , but we do not see turn@@ around in the whole country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie smote all the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison , to create it into the Olympic team .
they are the &quot; L@@ em Five &quot; because the next Olympics are just four tur@@ ers in the team . besides , this is the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a trainer .
but the reality looks so that Tur@@ ves are a more expensive sports and gymn@@ asts primarily can be maintained in private sectors which are maintained by parents , which are for training , furniture , travel and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their turbines and families ) . the list can be set to any number .
the majority of this gym lie in a prosper@@ ous suburbs that can support the business .
in these associations , the Tur@@ ner receive their overall training and that is a long @-@ term commitment to the families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer by Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , Train@@ ers from Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , trained both their athletes , since they started with the tur@@ f .
we have to be inspired by the municipalities of innumerable , young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a service @-@ bar@@ th and easier to access turn@@ training .
I was founded my turn@@ around 20 years ago .
we offer a free and affordable gymn@@ as@@ tics in Harlem for more than 15@@ ,000 urban young people ( mainly black and h@@ isp@@ anic ) and trained national and international winners .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer the youth high @-@ quality gymn@@ as@@ tics who earn the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
Tur@@ s develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and identification for the mind .
this combination offers lifel@@ ong benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success .
it &apos;s the inspiration of this team who want to bring thousands of young girls to be interested in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that is great .
it is so important to participate in sport , especially for girls .
this is a so exciting time .
thanks to Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real presentation of &quot; Girl power &quot; by the Hol@@ en of the Olympic team . thanks , F@@ ass you are motivated as many young girls with different backgrounds to begin their way , healthy , strong and successful young women .
assistance supplements would like to organize other strikes after they rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts proposal
the Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes through the adoption of a reform@@ ized contract with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7.000 assist@@ ants who voted on a vote , rejected him .
in July , Hunt plans already unveil@@ ed the contract , and said that the N@@ HS would be harmful in a &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; and that any further delay had been harmful to the employees and patients .
the first assistance supplements should receive a new contract , the changes in bed@@ - and weekend works , in order to improve the care at odd movement times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; DR Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chairman of the BM@@ A compromise for Assi@@ stance entered the last night in a communication with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assistance supplements to the proposed treaty continues to be serious concerns , especially that it will heal the current workforce of the workforce and it fails to treat all doctors &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for only eight weeks , which still remain until the first group of doctors have to fall under the new treaty , progress has to be made and the time is running out .
efforts from the BM@@ A to solve the disputes by talks at the government on their own sake and sometimes in de@@ af@@ ening silence .
this happened in the promise that Jerem@@ y Hunt had made only last month , that his door would always be open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y Hunt must act now , up@@ lift the suspension and appeal to the concerns of the assistance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he should not do this , the assistance supplements have made it clear that they are ready to perform further labour measures .
the last strike at the end of April saw a delay of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine @-@ operations and 100,000 dates in front , as nur@@ ses and specialists were involved to give doctors on the post@@ enk@@ ette cover .
the Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes through the adoption of the re@@ formed agreement with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A wants to be a better wave of re@@ mun@@ er@@ ation for the 5@@ 4,000 Assi@@ stance who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director @-@ General of the N@@ HS employees , called for assistance to stop the strike to quit the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; labour combat actions achieve nothing of the only little but they already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patient , care and their families only worry , need and interruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last two months we have spoken to the compromise of the assistance of assistance and with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries positively to concerns about the tut@@ el@@ age and whi@@ st@@ lif@@ low@@ ings .
employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as discharge , flexibility in training , training courses and gender @-@ specific pay@@ roll in medicine - a sign of how serious it was the employer , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health , concerning compliance with the agreements with BM@@ A in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per day drug , which can reduce heart attack
thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day drug , after having been recommended by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
the dul@@ c@@ ant drug T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeti@@ tive heart attack for individuals with cardi@@ ac disease .
the medication is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of a stroke or another heart attack .
the regulatory authority Nice of the N@@ HS has recommended a four year long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the regulatory authority Nice of the N@@ HS has recommended a four year long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
about 140@@ ,000 people suffer from a heart attack each year and a quarter of it suffer a further heart attack or stroke .
heart attack and stro@@ kes are caused by z@@ zes fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls , which make ins@@ criptions .
when it breaks down , it can cause a blood @-@ inn@@ sel that pet@@ rol the blood flow to the heart and caused a heart attack .
when the blood is dissolved , it can flow through the blood stream and c@@ ops the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
individuals who had already had a heart attack , are subject to a higher risk to another .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca , and is distributed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of cl@@ ashes un@@ probable power .
the design proposal from Nice , which was published today recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor ot@@ le Long@@ son , director of the Nice Health @-@ Techn@@ ological Center said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention have a quarter of all persons who suffered a heart attack , another heart attack or stroke - often with dis@@ astrous consequences . &quot;
fear of a renewed heart attack can have considerable negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in effectively in reducing other heart attack and stroke falls among people who already had a heart attack .
by a preliminary recommendation of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or we are pleased to be able to expand the treatment options for thousands of people that can benefit from it .
the information about the effectiveness and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the blood @-@ risk management - is limited to a period of up to three years . the executive committee recommends no treatment that eman@@ ates beyond this period of time .
culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ t , cho@@ col@@ ates in Muslim areas
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ ein Rah@@ man was last year on the dis@@ mis@@ sal of a government report because of corruption from office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ t has led that widespread constitu@@ ents were know@@ ingly ignored in Muslim congregations as a cr@@ ushing government report today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former cabinet of Sir Eric Pic@@ kl@@ es acc@@ esses the police , tri@@ but@@ chers and Town H@@ alls to have ignored evidence of election abuse on eth@@ ni@@ est and religion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former minister of integration and local government , who now is a face @-@ corruption , said that the intim@@ id@@ ation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that it should be the police to furn@@ ish ab@@ sten@@ ings outside of electoral cub@@ es to help protect voters .
he recommends that voters should lead a ID to prove their identity by elections .
at present , a vot@@ er must merely call its name and address .
the report proposes not removable ink at the finger of a person when they vote their choices to prevent anyone chosen twice .
whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower should obtain more protection , says Sir Eric .
it calls for the press to gain more access to local documents and decisions of no official comm@@ ent@@ ations or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this serves not only against the election , but is also said to protect the communist government before the wider corruption and finance culture that goes with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by the Down@@ ing Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets election sk@@ and@@ als in the east of London .
last year a special court decided that the ending Mayor Lut@@ ein Rah@@ man should be corrupt to corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the court was that Rah@@ man should per@@ vert the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that he had brought his critics with se@@ gregation and Islam@@ opho@@ bia to silence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rachel should have guided &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the rel@@ ati@@ ous duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 voices were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the consequence of a im@@ itation , where a person is chosen as someone else .
Sir Eric said that there were no evidence of fraud across the country .
he expressed particularly alar@@ ming to frau@@ dul@@ ent po@@ di@@ alling - in the older members of the Muslim community pressure on people would have made a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including filling out to prove the identity
in his report it says : &quot; said that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities was exer@@ ted , especially women and young people , in order to choose according to the Will of El@@ ders , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ ani or ban@@ quet background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that state institutions had such a behavior because of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over@@ sensitivity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in respect of eth@@ ni@@ cal and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the prohibition that political activists work &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to stop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; choices &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report that is considered by Ther@@ esa May , requires also tough@@ er registration testing , in order to prevent that the voting directory is used to mig@@ rate and welfare purposes .
consider options before choosing to ask for your ID .
do not use removable ink at the finger of a person as soon as she has given their voice to prevent someone cho@@ oses twice .
systematic audi@@ tions about the nationality of a person carry out to ensure that they are optional .
a three @-@ year limitation to applications for automatic let@@ tering .
Pro@@ hibition for political activists to complete stamp and envel@@ opes of let@@ tering elections .
the police give the authority to furn@@ ish f@@ ests on electoral stations .
a change in law , which facilitates an indictment for intim@@ id@@ ation according to the Re@@ presentation of the People Act 1983 ( Pop@@ ulation Act 1983 ) .
photograph@@ ing offered in electoral stations .
request that only English must be used in the choice stations ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that employees usually enforce that voters go alone into their choice .
Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it &apos; amaz@@ ingly &apos; that after the Tower of Ham@@ lets , there was no punishment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the electoral court has declared Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his dep@@ uty for a L@@ itan@@ ei on corrupt and illegal practices as un@@ de@@ af , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was referred to as guilty on a number of reasons - according to the high requirements in criminal proceedings - guilty .
he also critic@@ ises the effective &quot; Ab@@ ha@@ k@@ Control &quot; of the election registration divisions of the Town H@@ alls .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the Angel of Tower Ham@@ lets of last year was a warning signal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our country bears a proud heritage as the mother of the parliaments , but the worrying spread of choice and denial of some authorities threatened with this good reputation . &quot; &quot; &quot;

but the 24 @-@ year Olympics , this summer is by far not the only one of the gold fought Ath@@ le@@ let , who has its own famous double @-@ go@@ ers - at least not , if you should believe the social media faith .
at honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that fli@@ ck@@ out at the time on our screens , FE@@ MA@@ IL has created a lists of Olympics , which have more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Horn@@ í .
the hunters and the wolf : team member of the US team in ar@@ chery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared since his childhood with Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o
apart from the channel on the Rad@@ ren@@ n@@ bahn there are many people on the internet that could be a certain ar@@ cher of the Gem@@ ini @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o .
the team member of the U.S. team in ar@@ chery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a rush on Twitter after pictures , on which he sees the wolf of Wall Street Star in@@ tly similarly .
in fact , ar@@ cher got ins@@ anity to the social media with and gave to that he has already heard since his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; I myself don &apos;t see any big simil@@ arity with the exception of the facial hair , &quot; shared Bra@@ dy the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a ben@@ ign guy , so I am feeling well as compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 this year will undoubtedly go into the center : the all@@ est simil@@ arity between the British expan@@ se Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
the Russian Tur@@ ner in Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with its large , expres@@ sive eyes is said to be a col@@ ou@@ in for the Cub@@ an American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .

another appealing comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similar severe eyeb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medals in Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ f@@ im@@ ova points more than just the sun@@ t@@ anned skin and bl@@ on@@ den hair like the act@@ ress of Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ Cor@@ d , while the American Nathan was attacked by fans , an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar facial shape and eyes
not the only thing : a Twitter user was very happy about that others are also like the similarities
theory placed in the room : according to this user there is perhaps a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple perhaps a reason
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter U@@ ser@@ in explained their satisfaction that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the internet thinks that hope solo and Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the criticism against Byr@@ on Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came quickly and hard at which many had given him to speech
Twitter users did not hold back when they heard , like uns@@ ensi@@ bly Byr@@ on Mac@@ Donald was
another Twitter U@@ ser@@ in Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald .
you re@@ present the C@@ BC and Canada and makes us look like the r@@ aci@@ sts . # accessed .
short time later , Scott Rus@@ sel , who presented the C@@ BC broadcast live for the comment by Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; we are sorry that the comment has been broadcast over a swimming performance . &quot;
it was a unhappy chosen formula , sorry that it is happening . &quot;
C@@ BC apologi@@ zed at the end of more than 90 times at the people who responded to the sampling over Twitter
the commentary box Scott Rus@@ sel had to ap@@ olog@@ ise in the name of Mac@@ Donald
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ology at more than 90 other Twitter users who had compl@@ ained about the comments of Mac@@ Donald .
the network also apologi@@ zed quickly and gave a communication out .
we sincerely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible that it will be broad@@ cast@@ ed .
last night we quickly apologi@@ zed to our spectators for sending and our followers in social media .
to make clear , Byr@@ on comments related to the performance of s@@ wimm@@ ers in and not on them as a person .
nevertheless , they were un@@ reasonable and a miserable formulation . Byr@@ on does what he said , very sorry .
on Thursday morning , Mac@@ Donald used to be used in the mission and tried to justify his word by saying that it was not his intention that she is designed as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to apologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the women &apos;s blo@@ om staff@@ el at the C@@ BC Olympi@@ ad , he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have moved on the performance of s@@ wimm@@ ers in and not on them as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course no dis@@ cont@@ emp@@ t was intended and I am very sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
buyer in Pri@@ mark ou@@ tra@@ ged over wife who tried in the middle of the shop under@@ wear
the buyers did not know where to see , when a woman moved her clothes in the midst of a pri@@ mark to try under@@ p@@ ants .
in order to wor@@ sen the situation , they mu@@ cked out how they saw it , moved them out and laid them back to the shelf .
they crossed on and pro@@ bi@@ ded four pairs of under@@ p@@ ants in a shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping mall in Folk@@ estone .
the primary shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping mall in Folk@@ estone where the woman tried the under@@ p@@ ants before they put them back into the shelf
a mother of two children , Jenny David@@ son , who was at the same time in business , said that after the mysterious woman had tried the under@@ wear , &quot; she moved again and left the business without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people could not believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the selling area , they took a pair of under@@ p@@ ants from the base , moved their own tab@@ p@@ ants and p@@ ants and pro@@ spec@@ ted them .
&quot; she did not even try to find a slightly discreet place to do it - she just stood there , fre@@ ch like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone is star@@ ed when they pulled back the sub@@ tro@@ users , which you obviously didn &apos;t like to have it into the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she reiter@@ ated the same with three further sub@@ tro@@ users , before she finally decided that her had nothing to come again and turned out .
&quot; she didn &apos;t seem to b@@ other that she was watching someone - or about the person who might buy the under@@ p@@ ants that she tried them . &quot;
Mrs. David@@ son , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; as rel@@ u@@ ct@@ ant to think that someone would like to take home with another person who had not been washed away . &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
Ms. David@@ son added : &quot; as I have been with , the staff tried to pull the clothes out of the sale after she went - what is just as good . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate it to go home with a new pair of under@@ p@@ ants and finding out that another woman she had taken and returned , and they were not washed away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ man of Pri@@ mark said : &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident occurring on Tuesday , 9 August in our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot;

how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a from arms attack
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of D@@ ail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a bit safer for you .
we talked with Rh@@ on Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand@@ master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Ver@@ ban@@ des in New York to find out how to move with armed rob@@ bers on the distance .
regardless of whether you &apos;re approaching from the front or from the back , this video will show you how you can turn your th@@ ief for your th@@ ief .
when you turn to you from the back then you should turn to yourself as a first , so you can see your att@@ acker and &quot; go out of the wal@@ nut , &quot; says Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi .
grab the weapon then between your front arm and your shoulder before you hit it with your free el@@ bow .

Reis@@ ender Ian W@@ right sch@@ ab@@ t for a guide to his tongue at the nar@@ ro@@ est locations of Europe
a bri@@ tish trav@@ eller under@@ went his immune system and wor@@ sen@@ le@@ x a serious inspection by lowering some of the prot@@ ru@@ gged and ek@@ det@@ est places in Europe .
the moder@@ ator and travel author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k sh@@ elled his course on a Euro zone , a sla@@ p on Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a dish@@ kno@@ b of a draw bul@@ b , as well as a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance capacity of his immune system .
in front of the le@@ aks of each object he used a L@@ umin@@ om@@ eter to show up and show us what he is going to join .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the experiment made under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner St@@ ron@@ th &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; brought some surprising results in day@@ light . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the thought , the flus@@ hing kno@@ b of a draw bul@@ ls , which was already used by thousands of others , may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive but actually are in a kitchen sink more bad bacteria .
on his journey through Europe Mr. W@@ right with doctors and medical professionals talked about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and their own health .
fortunately , nothing left what he desc@@ ended , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr. W@@ right was known to test the resistance of his intest@@ ine by traveled through the world and ate unique and wonderful things .
from public funds to train stations up to flus@@ hing of toilets , the task introduced its immune system definitely below a sample
in the film he told , &quot; already as a child I was relatively worried about what my health concerns and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and mud water . &quot;
in the film he was able to do his reputation in any case .
the only thing he refused , was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
its pro@@ s@@ line showed a l@@ om@@ ometric number of over 4000 units .
in comparison , the L@@ umin@@ ometric hands is less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet that he refused to refused , after their L@@ umin@@ om@@ eters was cut over 4000 units , while newly emp@@ tied hands to be one of less than 60
Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products vali@@ dated the Reis@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner St@@ ain@@ th , &quot; which shows the number of different places like the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what I have found in a toilet , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; near &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing dirty than that !
I will not touch here because it is un@@ locked here .
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner St@@ ain@@ th &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company sol@@ ves Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Ge@@ fil@@ us , which contains both l@@ ac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us as well as vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system .
vali@@ os senior Venice President for snacks , juices and New categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ jan@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to offer the consumer something new .
something that is fascinating to look and at the same time explains the advantages of pro@@ bio@@ tics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we led crazy Bra@@ in@@ stor@@ ming by the fact that we said &quot; L@@ ass us Ian calls &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they claim that the interest in intestinal health will become a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them into a bigger context - the good and poor bacteria in our daily environment , the importance of intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system .
growing interest in the intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide the consumer of more information in an interesting manner .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of hum@@ our !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the direc@@ ting of the film , added : &quot; let me say so - I would have had my respect for Ian , if he had noticed some of things I have reli@@ eved him , just like the ek@@ el@@ ous Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things with which it was easier to bring Ian to finish them and others with which this was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am glad we have recorded some of these dirty treats on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a vali@@ dated survey conducted by 2015 , 84 percent of all respon@@ dents l@@ actic acid bacteria , especially with the well being of the stomach and the intest@@ ine and 58 percent said that they are at least occasionally use of occasionally products that are included in to@@ bac@@ ill@@ ac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us .
A@@ social family destro@@ ys from Del@@ o@@ gi@@ os social apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
an as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family left their social apartment after a del@@ o@@ gi@@ fication with a damage to the amount of £ 50,000 because it wre@@ cked their neighbours .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and their partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after they were en@@ acted out of their estate , sho@@ cked alignment of the housing gen@@ ossen@@ schaft found the property in an irre@@ par@@ able condition .
the walls sh@@ elled holes on , wooden sh@@ ri@@ mp were ri@@ pped up , rub@@ b@@ ish was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubric@@ ated to the walls .
the family were sigh@@ ted and it is thought that it is now living in a private accommodation
Donn@@ a Mc@@ Ev@@ oy , who works for the house administration at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that they did not afraid that the apartment would no longer be repaired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an absolute night@@ mare for people here and I think people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider as this property is probably considered as a beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is it also .
the couple had three sons , who lived in the apartment and the police said that the terror which the family had added , street struggles with Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ sleeps , intim@@ id@@ ate from residents , drug abuse , drug trading and over@@ hau@@ led scre@@ ams , cir@@ cl@@ ans and floods .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease , was set in June an arrangement for an anti @-@ social behavior .
in some rooms of the house , which is under circumstances be demol@@ ished , old rub@@ b@@ ish was found
the property were tra@@ ded in the estate in which drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden sh@@ ri@@ mp .
neighbours said that they saw them fighting on the streets and then forced to inv@@ oked the police .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ o@@ gi@@ o@@ gi@@ es she and her partner this week , by the estate after they gave them a prolonged period of 11 weeks to make volunte@@ ered .
the dolphins were che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbours that said that their life has been made to hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; She spoke about anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived for 20 years next to them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today tomorrow we could not sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we stood up , because it was so quiet here - we are not used !
now , where they are finally away , it will be beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it had given the family to cooperate with the local authorities .
the family lived in the house , which the police had been at regular intervals , 20 years long
on the covered side of the municipal house , rub@@ b@@ ish and old toys were under@@ cast
he added : &quot; it is a shame that it is the ten@@ ant to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and family , as a del@@ usion is always the last step that Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing takes into consideration .
this was a very difficult case since the behaviour was extremely difficult and their actions had to be hor@@ r@@ aw@@ ful for their neighbours .
I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the community who have come to us and have given us the information to have done .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that this development will don@@ ate some neighbours and the message teaches that anti @-@ social behavior will not be tolerated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress which is om@@ itted in one of the bedrooms of the house after Del@@ o@@ gi@@ fication on the ground .
workers of the house @-@ government are now rus@@ hed to gar@@ n@@ ish that surround the house
in 2014 the police led a raid in the house and found about 70@@ g of cannabis as well as orph@@ ans , par@@ ap@@ her@@ os and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ don was given an attack after having found himself guilty of the ownership of a drug of the class B in merchant account .
she claimed that money came for a tom@@ bst@@ one of her son Lee Skel@@ don that was in 2013 with an automobile accident .
once they were without shelter , it is assumed that T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many rooms of the house were sh@@ aded with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police say that they will susp@@ end rent@@ ers who do not keep themselves in the house order
Angela C@@ row shared by the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , that the dolphins can hold a clear warning to the other ten@@ ant that do not hold off to the house@@ holders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who can think that they can behave without self @-@ confidence as well as those who have been damaged by such a behavior . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour which continue to cooperate with partners to protect our communities . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at short notice I reck@@ on with ten thousand prot@@ ectors from Turkey in Germany , when the Erdo@@ gan regime fought the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Com@@ position of Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because the government had already gone through Kur@@ dish high @-@ bur@@ dens with pen@@ alties , they are 500@@ ,000 Kurds in Turkey on the run .
after the twi@@ sted put@@ sch even sec@@ ular and op@@ position@@ ists ethnic Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many will start anew in Europe if they are further suppres@@ sed in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that adop@@ ts refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the allies def@@ endant the targeted settlement of Syrian Arab in Kur@@ dish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tic cities .
thus Erdo@@ gan will boost the break @-@ up pressure on the remaining Kurds .
&quot; they are the last major minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have already been wi@@ ped out or driven in the past hundred years , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also CD@@ U member .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association called for that the German government is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and its supporters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also in Germany there is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wit@@ ching hunt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Erdo@@ gan @-@ critics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len Movement also fears the flight of many Turks .
more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kurds and Op@@ position@@ ists .
the fire @-@ mark@@ ers as Gü@@ len @-@ followers destroyed teachers and other ac@@ adem@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who does not fit and Erdo@@ gan , sitting on packed waves , by the way also the Kem@@ alists and saw blades , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , president of the Gü@@ len @-@ nearby Foundation Dialogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the newspaper reported on appeal to figures of the Federal Ministry of Finance , the Turks had already reported the biggest group of political persecution in Germany before the coup , in Germany .
on June 30 , this has been 11.@@ 3@@ 86 people and thus nearly 29 per cent of all than the asylum justified ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
in this survey , not those before war , poverty or of the lack of interest are being re@@ mun@@ er@@ ated .
asylum entitled to the Basic Law are exclusively politically , thus by government side , individually per@@ sec@@ uted .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; to go where it does &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals do not receive anything from the summer @-@ election campaign with - and the vac@@ ation@@ ers from Nord@@ rhein @-@ Westfalen may not choose the country &apos;s day .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , they have understood .
the country &apos;s choice will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ in parliament decided already at the beginning of the year .
for stupid than so far it is not : summer holidays , He@@ at and Land@@ shut @-@ du@@ ck - this is bit@@ es .
the locals who are to be convinced by the election fighters are on vacation .
most holiday@@ makers who are in the country are on U@@ se@@ dom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not natives , so you are not allowed to choose the country .
in addition , practical problems come : in the holidays are hel@@ pers that distribute the posters , ballo@@ ons , fl@@ yers , and end up voices , only ti@@ res@@ ected .
until 4 September 2016 , the election and the last year of the Feri@@ a Day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to leave even an election campaign against the people over themselves .
the hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun .
and it is also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win S@@ ell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must be afraid of his office .
the SPD since 1998 the strongest party , is now in surveys clearly beyond the CD@@ U .
thrilling is to cut off like strongly new@@ com@@ ing Af@@ ters , and what remains at the end of the end @-@ dust .
S@@ ell@@ ering , 66 years of age and since 2008 Prime Minister , makes an almost un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive campaign campaign , one sees from its large plac@@ ings .
he travels through the land , distributed ro@@ ses and ch@@ atting a little with the people , just as it did already his legendary word @-@ kar@@ st predecessor Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff .
otherwise , past@@ ing has gotten his old feet and gives chan@@ cell@@ or Merkel to blame the Mand@@ los@@ som@@ ing the Af@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your refugee policy , you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create the rise of sp@@ op@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him a beautiful office . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U with its top @-@ channel data , the Interior of Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when you make the wrong time at the right place of election campaign .
it has been invited to German Chancellor Angela Merkel to large number of German Chancellor Angela Merkel , Germany , on the north @-@ east .
but the target group fails , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg @-@ Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority of other Länder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; def@@ endant Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in the N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there is a pity to anyone from other corners of Germany , even Angela Merkel to listen .
otherwise , the northern @-@ CD@@ U does not reno@@ un@@ ces the usual choice of election on market locations and mostly m@@ alls with umbrellas and air balloon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that , so says Kok@@ ert , play only a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subordin@@ ate roll . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also the Union has noticed that in the country it br@@ ush@@ ed the base that it must be very strict , to find a wire to the people again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are going on as the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : hardly ever exists in the rest of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Council of the CD@@ U &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chancellor Kok@@ ert &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to his co @-@ president , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they must go where it is we@@ h@@ doing , namely where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Gol@@ dene weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because much is at stake , S@@ ell@@ ering has now called his SPD to a particularly committed election campaign .
in surveys the Socialists and Democrats also last with 22 percent behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just under the Af@@ for@@ ge ( 19 ) .
with the election in 2011 the SPD was still winning clearly with 3@@ 5.6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
the Gre@@ ens , Mini @-@ party with seven percent in the pol@@ ls , are likely to provide the jump into the country &apos;s day .
they make a modern virtue from the holiday @-@ need and place their choice of campaign into the internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it calls the state @-@ called Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , green electoral campa@@ ign@@ ers on spi@@ ke search for native stim@@ uli among the tourists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ jek , the top @-@ kan@@ gar@@ ment , cur@@ v@@ t straight with a house@@ boat through the m@@ ec@@ kl@@ ine lakes and finds it even beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your impression : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; election holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 rehabilitation : restaurants @-@ restaurants suffering from blocking
on the quick@@ ness with which the B 27 is refurbished , there is nothing to complain about .
the responsible for those responsible for those who begin at 5.@@ 30 am in the morning and only end up until 8 pm , there is all@@ enth@@ r@@ ally praise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did everything quite z@@ ag , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tells El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the Jet @-@ Gas station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is no return .
the construction site could be postponed until the half @-@ time as scheduled to the south until the end of October everything will be ready .
the dischar@@ ges of the responsible for the construction work is responsible , for example when it comes to the establishment of accommodation trips .
since the construction site was emig@@ rated to the south and also the blocking of the asphalt road in O@@ f@@ ter@@ dingen has been removed and thus the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg is again relaxed , the traffic situation is relaxed within the place .
the citizens can now go to O@@ f@@ ter@@ dingen from the B 27 again .
the so@@ fter traffic through the place seems to go back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were partly considerable complaints , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the responsibility for the rehabilitation management of the rehabilitation representative Florian King . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the inhabitants of Bach@@ e@@ straße , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many shr@@ ubs were looking for themselves and more familiar to their Nav@@ i as the sign@@ age .
what led to some lor@@ ries in the areas of residence .
as also the speed b@@ umps have not been observed , the community called for increased the vehicle &apos;s vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were considerable exce@@ eding &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says King who made himself a position himself on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are two to three per minute fl@@ ashes .
the quick@@ est was on the pace with 77 poles in the speed @-@ 30 zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but since the construction site has been further developed , but it has become more calm . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the business@@ men at B 27 it is only a small Tro@@ st that is now open to customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg .
business@@ men don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
but that the B 27 rehabilitation took place with them into turnover , lets each one be questioned .
however , some more and some less affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who has less to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end customer &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; thus for other companies , for whom the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; even at the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Mai@@ er , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slight decline &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but also a fact that naturally &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the run &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is lacking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most exploited is the Local along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds clear words .
this is already exist@@ ential .
not only him , but all the hosts have met &quot; hard . &quot;
it was missing the customers from He@@ ch@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil .
we need to be glad about every euro turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the sales in sales were driven on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far beyond 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the road marking took its operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by two years back &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
half of his staff was released to release him .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and the half had been released , politics would have responded differently .
instead , Prime Minister Jörg Schmidt has a request from G@@ öh@@ ner whether there might be a financial balance , with the reference to the guest house , otherwise the advantages of the location on the B 27 Now it must also include the disadvantages , which carry out in the reconstruction .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows of other coun@@ ties , where something gener@@ ously was handled .
in all cases , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his guest house will continue .
after all , the family business has been located already since 17@@ 15 , it refers to the long history .
that other regular guests can now see less often because of the complicated traffic management , he can understand .
if you cannot go , it is also very different .
that his tri@@ bal climate change once again after the end of the refur@@ bish@@ ment , has no doubt that G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubts .
despite the crises with BSE and bird @-@ gri@@ t , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the effects of B 27 @-@ construction based on his customers for the greatest crisis which has experienced its hospitality in their long history .
six months construction work , which is already brutal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; constantly , in the name of the terrorist fight against laws . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks , Interior de Mai@@ zi@@ ère now presents a thick safety package .
but what has a th@@ ul@@ ment status to do with terror ?
and what does the Ko@@ ali@@ tional partner says to all that ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the Com@@ conc@@ iler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically reasonable , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the Federal Minister for the presentation of his new security package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you do not ask anyone .
others , further points would first be discussed within the parties .
also by the participation I am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as Interior Minister he is located to the outcome and to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reco@@ ver@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the Coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is a little time hidden before he presents his conclusions for the safety in the Republic .
but this is now all the more extensive .
some is already known , announced that a new security authority is to take care of the b@@ aking encrypted communication is not new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also not the fact that Germany must implement several EU def@@ aults to passenger data and arms law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the call for more video surveillance and staff for security authorities is not surprising .
partly , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère starts a second stop for proposals which did not make up with the SPD so far : he wants to put sympathy for terrorist groups under penalty and jihadists with double citizenship using the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is the CD@@ U @-@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he keeps this nevertheless for reasonable and demanding also nothing that has no chances with the Ko@@ ali@@ tion@@ partner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few new ideas presents de Mai@@ zi@@ ère .
they are partly in himself : he plans spe@@ edy recovery process for de@@ port@@ ations and more possibilities for the detention of people in front of the de@@ portation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refugees who are targeted to the country , should check their smartphones and disclose social @-@ media account for a safety examination . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in distr@@ action for exp@@ ired asylum seekers , he wants to make some worse off than so far - about such , which commit crimes or their papers to waste their identity .
some of them is political and legally delicate .
this also works un@@ balanced and leaves any questions open .
and at some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of thought , for example - the question arises : what actually does this have to do with safety and terror ?
yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the subjects of refugees and terror .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is not possible to address these words that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were also many people concerned about the high refugee deal concerned about security .
and things that deeply employed people have now not been spar@@ ed in election @-@ election periods .
the inner security is enormous in the focus .
only the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the re@@ assurance is great .
and yes , there are campaigns .
the Union and the SPD will therefore become increasingly in position with the issue of internal security .
in the past few days there went up between the two parties .
only a gar@@ sti@@ ff argument over the equipment of the Federal Police , then over a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons @-@ interior ministers , in which the departments also call a Bur@@ ka ban and a return from the double citizenship .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère also deals with irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able tones .
from a return of the double pass , he gets nothing .
we have free@@ ze the discussion in Germany .
you restart it , be not useful .
and at a Bur@@ ka ban , he have constitutional concerns .
whether its own package is constitu@@ ent at all corners and whether it is actually &apos; reasonable &apos; for the co @-@ operation partner , it is necessary to show up only .
there is quite a lot in what could take care of dispute .
however , the SPD is currently trying to profile himself in the matter of inner security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Par@@ then@@ ef Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ aled only a careful talk and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
still Volkswagen gli@@ ding comes from .
despite diesel engine than the supplier figures increase worldwide .
but not in all markets it is running smoothly .
in the recall campaign there is host to one term .
Volkswagen starts from the deliveries ex @-@ deliveries to the second half @-@ year .
Europe &apos;s biggest highways can continue in the course of the past year , despite its many brands and some well @-@ driven markets further than a plus .
but in July the nuclear brand VW was weak@@ ened mainly in Western Europe and thus res@@ ili@@ ent the total sale as the company recorded in the D@@ ax company .
worldwide , the VW was sold in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than in the previous year .
in Western Europe alone , according to China the second most important market , sales were 14 per cent under the same year &apos;s prior year .
in the home market Germany , the deliveries to almost a six @-@ sixth place .
bran@@ ded by Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann introduced the weak@@ est numbers from July mainly on two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , in some core markets , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed economic environment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was given a purchase of purchase . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the situation concerning the coup attempt in Turkey also the British vote for the exit from the EU explained a spokes@@ woman .
in the USA , where the exhau@@ st system first escal@@ ate , is also further a minus to be@@ ech .
large support for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , the mainly affected houses of the Nieder@@ s@@ achsen appear anyway gli@@ ding through the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months there is a mere supply of 0.@@ 9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles with be@@ ech .
consolidated sales Fred Kap@@ pler further forward a sales point from January to July .
1.3 percent more vehicles supplied Volkswagen in this time , around $ 9@@ 04 million .
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated with a software treatment tests .
in Germany alone , VW is calling approximately 2.5 million cars for retro@@ fitting into the workshops .
in the course of retro@@ fitting , VW , that the re@@ modeling of cars did not have any negative effects .
after the retro@@ fitting of the vehicles , there will be no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor outputs .
the highway place the client after retro@@ fit a &quot; guaranteed &quot; certificate , but I do not speak of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was on Friday in a company name .
the reason are legal intri@@ c@@ acies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen granted his German customers now a guarantee for diesel @-@ made diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these would have confirmed the last Monday VW representative in the Federal Ministry of Finance .
the Ministry of Finance was confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has to fulfil the conditions of my investigation Commission and the KBA in full . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; devi@@ ations from this will not be accepted &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; declared Federal Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to ministry .
VW has assumed the guarantee that in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor outputs after retro@@ fitting no deteri@@ or@@ ations take place and all type of type @-@ relevant vehicle values remain unchanged .
Volkswagen himself uses the term &quot; guarantee &quot; but not as it was in a company name .
the wide term &quot; warranty &quot; sees Volkswagen the possibility that customers come for example a half year after the retro@@ fitting , approximately with a motor damage to a workshop - and this could result back to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
also in the customer interest , it is important to avoid any other damage that does not have anything to do with the sc@@ andal that comes to an uncertainty with regard to possible warran@@ ties as it was .
therefore , VW is not use the term &quot; guarantee . &quot;
the Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands from rich thri@@ ves in future criminal law - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chief Apostle Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s just about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or daily accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bundes@@ verband Deutscher Banks speaks of an individual case and does not see it a signal : normal savings would have to be &quot; not afraid to pay for their savings pen@@ ises . &quot;
store banks money on night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay her 0,@@ 4 percent pen@@ alties .
this charge demands the Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank G@@ mund from September of private and corporate clients for deposits over 100,000 euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or daily accounts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first 100,000 Euro are free . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100,000 cost will cost 400 Euros a year &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has been her@@ ed for 40 million Euros , which could be lifted from one day to another , which he could not be able to exploit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they lie with me on the bank account and cause 0.@@ 4 percent cost , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot put up for any million 4000 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs do he pass after the urs@@ ed principle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cash simply leave in the Tres@@ ores of the Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank would be much too dangerous : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have experienced four times , I don &apos;t feel the fifth ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the banker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most customers have had understanding and varied on other investment forms .
only a few emig@@ rated to other banks .
the cooperative federation declared : &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the ECB is causing significant costs in all banks . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to bear in mind , be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economically viable &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks therefore have their fees for account management , credit cards or transfers .
with offen@@ ders for deposits from three million euros had made the Thur@@ in@@ gia Pop@@ ular and Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land with its sk@@ at@@ bank branch 2014 head@@ lines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , main business leaders of the banking association said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t expect that private clients need to pay for deposits , this is the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks much too strong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a banker said , on T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; a cli@@ ent@@ el , which is equipped with a little bit of su@@ mp@@ tuous . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can become a problem for a small bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they were free money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 1911 founded @-@ based cooperative bank G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gladly , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
in the region , known actors , athletes and entrepreneurs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cooperative federation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; association Association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are currently no other banks known to calculate a compensation for deposits of private clients &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Spe@@ aker Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the president of the Federation of German People &apos;s banks and Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ Banks ( B@@ v@@ R ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared : &quot; the threshold to go to the neg@@ atives towards the private clients , is very , very high . &quot;
competition is tough , and it dro@@ ught the migration of investors to competition .
customers in Germany do not like that in width .

these records , above mentioned ( he sent me the sn@@ apshots by e @-@ mail , I am not followed at home ) , dress the walls of his living room .
the reason why he possesses such a considerable number of albums and singles , the result of his available income : he is now able to buy plates that he could not afford to buy them and again buy items which he sold , when he was young and bank@@ rupt .
&quot; many things I buy , are from the late 60@@ s , early 70s , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I have probably been young to buy them , &quot; says he .
he agrees that those who buy plates , rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend alone time , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink very much .
this is my L@@ aster .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers he meets on the You@@ Go@@ v profile .
but he also noticed a new wave of people who have been influenced by the media , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and set itself again to buy their old records .
of the conversations that I have led , people usually have been dra@@ ined in the same way around 1998 or 1999 .
customers that once sold their records to buy CDs , now sell their CDs to buy again their records , &quot; says he .
this would explain the boom of tra@@ ilers of a particular age .
but what about the alleged emotional importance of plates ?
it only takes a few seconds in a store like Ph@@ onica , to realize that record stores a soothing community of like @-@ minded people .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers participated in the cont@@ act@@ less payments system .
some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to withdraw to the stability of familiar noise gri@@ ps , of objects , the happ@@ i@@ ent Ju@@ gen@@ der@@ ers .
&quot; I think , sometimes it can be the col@@ t of a void or of the possession of material owner than a kind of con@@ sol@@ ation , &quot; says WE@@ Z .
this is my collectors as a collectors so I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to mentally employ mentally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fle@@ et a staff from a plate @-@ pi@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey of IC@@ M in April un@@ covered that almost 50 % of the people who bought a record last month , they have not heard yet .
the survey took place also that 41 % of a record player possess that they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record , no record player .
at this time of the message I would probably be very concerned , while I was bl@@ ur@@ red by a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova Comp@@ il@@ ations .
J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works in sounds of the Universe ( data number : three men middle ages ) has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy &quot; of the Re@@ vi@@ vals .
&quot; someone came only recently here and said , &quot; I do not have a record player , but I would like to buy a radi@@ oh@@ er record , so that I can put them into the shelf . &quot;
this is not a big percentage but it definitely happened .
more productive , less music @-@ cl@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have people who say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no record player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are younger people , not older , who only slowly get pur@@ ported .
mo@@ p , which has dedicated the sound plates almost a whole floor , has a b@@ under@@ ed audience when I clean@@ se .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make pictures , teen@@ ager and women middle age .
even if the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the aforementioned shops - Wild Be@@ ast New Year &apos;s syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ er- and sex@@ c@@ unning Pop instead of experimental jazz , reconc@@ iled from the loud@@ speakers - it is good to see such diversity among customers .
none of them looks som@@ er@@ ous but na@@ der psychological trau@@ mat@@ a are difficult to determine if one stands next to someone 30 seconds long .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , runs for a few minutes in the business and looked upon the variation of the plates available for sale .
it makes more an imm@@ or@@ tal mor@@ tal as a large one .
it does not deserve much , therefore the collecting of plates is not a real option , she says .
it costs much .
it &apos;s easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; she is driving with a lover si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it is truly unique .
my last stop is a shop , which is said that a new generation of record lovers should have inspired by : urban Out@@ f@@ itters .
while I give to the An@@ no@@ ises the je@@ ans hot@@ p@@ ants to patterns , I observe a group of young teenagers that will be group@@ ed for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter are superior to buy a cros@@ ley record player .
on the left there is a stair@@ well , a wall full of records of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential sheets for an average collection .
nobody looks at her - maybe because they are only purely decorative , some as far above that it is impossible to write them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is pure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; record &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but considering that any attraction for these objects mean more money for the industry and to send some customers to the depths of So@@ hos for more , there is nothing to complain .
there is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , the one that is most suitable for luxury objects like plates .
even if my research studies took that the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote , let them , at least in record business in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors , who exist in reality , record business and online @-@ for@@ ks , un@@ considered .
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
they spend their Thursday morning with certainty with certainty with certainty by stores of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves by plates , while they fl@@ atter the view of an un@@ c@@ anny , 30 @-@ year false moder@@ ator , which rises over the shoulders of nothing wrong men middle ages .

French Court ref@@ uses an offer regarding demo@@ lition of shops in the jungle refugee camp
a French dish has rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais , do@@ zens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais , living in the thousands of refugees living .
in case of a court proceedings this week ar@@ gues that the state should be authorised to sell 72 provisional shops , where persons within the camp goods , sell , hair@@ dressing services offer or tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 P@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants sell .
the pre@@ fecture also argued that these places should be lower , because they would be a parallel economy which would not be paid out of which no taxes would be paid , and those a fire@@ - and san@@ al risk .
humanitarian groups shared with the Court that the shops and restaurants are important because the free meals that are offered by public supported union and other groups cannot provide sufficient food for the growing numbers in the camp .
they also led that provisional shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the issu@@ ance of people who operate the 72 provisional trading , but adm@@ its that the concerns of the pre@@ fecture of Calais is absolutely in@@ comprehensible . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the judge Jean @-@ François Mol@@ la said that food shops , cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than just feed people who live &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that the areas provide quiet meeting places between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places that was threatened by defe@@ ats , was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , which is gener@@ alized , and 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on Asyl@@ um for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0@@ ,000 people have signed the petition to protect the Kids &apos;s Café .
in a letter to the Guardian , it meant that closure &quot; for these children of a disaster would be of which the recent eight years are old . &quot;
the two aid organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants are estimated at Friday that the number of persons increased in the jungle of living in more than 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase in new@@ com@@ ers over the summer .

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
Germany &apos;s razor must adapt to the next generation of speed measurements : in different federal states , among other things in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash devices are tested , the tem@@ pos@@ ing of particularly effective over@@ run .
the futur@@ istic acting En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example on in@@ genu@@ ity where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on motorway building or to build bridges with temporary , there is often no necessary infrastructure to take care of there with a stationary car@@ vers for compliance with speed b@@ umps .
a lasting mobile building can be too dangerous or costly .
the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its battery stops five days , the case data is encrypted via a modem .
with laser measurement technology all vehicles can also be recorded simultaneously via several tracks simultaneously .
variable speed b@@ umps as well as through@@ put of the robot to time , strip @-@ strip and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in the highly @-@ driven state you can move the trailer to the manufacturer with each car with trailer hit@@ ch .
so that it is not easy to cl@@ aut , it is lo@@ wered to the measurement mode so that the wheels in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and by the way also disappear .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the car@@ vers from V@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 the trailer has been tested according to indications of Vit@@ ronic in different Länder since 2015 and now also used .

great Britain gets silver in the 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by , after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold takes place
the impressive performance of Britain at 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by came in the finals on Thursday evening to a ab@@ rupt stop at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is when they were be@@ aten with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the De@@ c stage here in Rio .
Fi@@ ji has shared a master class in handling , side @-@ Step@@ ping , post @-@ back , line @-@ up and rotating power to win gold - her first olymp@@ ic wa@@ ist of any colour .
the defeat was destroyed by the not too bad tro@@ st@@ prizes of the Silver medal - Great Britain &apos;s fourth day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they smote New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the distinct defeat of the Bo@@ cs , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ finals on the same day could return to them in the finals .
but irrespective of it , Fi@@ ji should have be@@ aten in this form a 15 @-@ man team .
it could be a con@@ sol@@ ation for GB - but will probably not - that at least a Br@@ ite tomorrow will hang a gold medal around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is boss Ben Ry@@ an , the former boss for England from Wimbledon .
GB had a difficult path behind him .
eight years ago , she lost at Ry@@ an every game at the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they lost only one .
this sle@@ eves will be we@@ ed , but the progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji started wonderful and caused the attacks GB@@ s off fun exhau@@ sts .
it felt for the captain Tom Mitch@@ ell and Co. in , as if one would run into driving buses . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 to the top , as the O@@ sea Col@@ in@@ is@@ au in the corner touching .
with four minutes of playing time , Jerry Tu@@ wai had another attack from the right corner which he turned into .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly has the ball .
a he@@ avier ra@@ ining of Mitch@@ ell stopped the mountain from Mann Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa to achieve a third gate , but Fi@@ ji has only stopped Fi@@ ji .
in the seventh minute , J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a has a touch@@ down in the right corner and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the re @-@ appearance and there was still a minute of play ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ p@@ ked by further weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB teams and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the transformation brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
it &apos;s been as if Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while I was still going to read .
this is how it is .
GB introduced fundamental changes to the half @-@ time and completed the fi@@ ji@@ c gap ... for whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half time until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova ran after a brilliant stop@@ play of Fi@@ ji .
Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for GB , made a touch@@ down in the left @-@ hand corner of a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game was running long in favor of the south @-@ selling isl@@ anders , whose fans sang , flags and d@@ anced on the ble@@ ach@@ ers .
it was not hard to admire the playful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the cake icing on the cake with another attempt in the last seconds .
the pad , the Fi@@ j@@ is im@@ pover@@ ished , and GB k@@ war@@ ns cr@@ ush@@ ingly be@@ aten in the lawn .
formerly on the day Fi@@ ji Japan had been defeated in the semi@@ finals with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain urged South Africa in a scar@@ ce semi @-@ final match from the race - Great Britain conversion of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ cs in the first half to the front , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke down the line with impressive work and achieved a gate under the post in the second half .
a brilliant late Tac@@ x of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ occasion teams , secured the gain - and therefore the silver medal .
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by battle with the Cancer of the trainer for rowing
there will be no em@@ ot@@ in@@ al@@ eres of gold than with these games and that wants to hot .
from the first stroke to last , 220 hard H@@ ieve , which enter into history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional significance in its golden moment at Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even if there were only those who were sitting at the show , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the Train@@ ers Robin Williams , was all@@ ure as she graduated from the second Olympi@@ ag@@ old in two without a tax lady , the first women in the history of British sports that laid on such a scale .
your domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all you have 3@@ 9.@@ ter un@@ trained usage , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled .
what we see are two brilliant Ath@@ let@@ inside which gli@@ de about the surface with the elegance of spon@@ ge , which reflects not the type of trim it too da@@ ze .
behind each gold in ruin there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of wild hero@@ ines which make the difference and there was no one assistant than the coach who would not know about 30 months ago , whether he would survive this day even when he was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said he was risky .
I had brass cancer , which is op@@ eri@@ ding and this did it .
if you do not do that , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been a rather narrow situation .
it changes a little bit of view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio were lucky that he could be at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , could begin what the break kept to a minimum , in case that under such circumstances is the correct term .
I needed money , so I needed to go better again soon .
it was an incentive .
I was in the hospital and ran on the station around - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet to a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice .
this is how it begins .
rowing in itself is a challenge , but this makes it an even bigger one .
in the in@@ fertility of victory , their first thoughts on Williams , which had a nerve @-@ rise in the morning a little more than usual to talk and tried to process his own fears .
St@@ anning that was as captain in the Royal Arti@@ ll@@ ery Reg@@ iment in a bet in Afghanistan , &quot; I was this week an emotional wre@@ ck . that &apos;s perhaps something extremely , but it means so much . &quot;
it repeated only how much I mean to how much I and Hel@@ en and also Robin worked .
it was three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
without Robin , we would have no one , therefore a massive thanks to him . he is the best trainer in the world .
I could not have a better person for exercising or a better coach .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have no race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents were unable to keep up with .
even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to start , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had a lot to reserve .
we were very at the moment tr@@ apped .
Hel@@ en called &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important to not be able to root out .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not looking out to make some Tol@@ les .
we didn &apos;t want fire@@ works today , we simply wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race which we did .
the couple will take a time for one year before making decisions about its future .
Glo@@ ver has to appear next week on a wedding , their own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that that was my last race .
that would have been too much pressure .
in London it took around six months to conc@@ eive that I am a Olympi@@ ans .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
that feels so much better , &quot; she said .
31 years professionally made for clarity
&quot; &quot; &quot; the managing director of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ eit@@ en@@ stein@@ gruppe &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; R@@ ett t G@@ öl@@ ler , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; goes to retirement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association is considered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bay@@ ern@@ fo@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a small fresh drinking water @-@ purpose association as a model for the great hydro@@ manufacturers .
thus it was some time ago in the origin@@ alt@@ on in a contribution of Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; little later , the water forum of the government of sub@@ fran@@ ken was announced the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ap@@ fran@@ ken &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bay@@ ern &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bay@@ ern@@ els &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was widely regarded as exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
behind all this stands Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler , which was 31 years in the ex@@ iting association , of which 28 years was as managing director .
he has now been reti@@ ring at the age of 65 .
the drinking water @-@ purpose association of the V@@ eit@@ en@@ stone @-@ association with its headquarters in K@@ ott@@ endorf , municipality of Breit@@ brunn , produces approximately 150@@ ,000 cu@@ bic meters of water and supplies 32 places and hamlets with about 5@@ 500 residents .
member communities are the churches of Volker , Breit@@ brunn , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the city of Baun@@ ah .
for further towns and municipalities there are water supply agreements .
the current chairman , Breit@@ brun@@ ns of Citizens in Ger@@ tru@@ d She@@ l ( F@@ W ) , reminded that Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler 1985 was set as a water in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Con@@ feder@@ ate Association in 1988 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they have been extended by water management and maintenance work on office and organisational activities , the budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency measures on weekends , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chairman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in outstanding events they called the start @-@ up and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , plots of purchase in the area of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation for farmers , the restructuring of the flood vessel ( 1999 ) , the re @-@ creation of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the participation of water pi@@ pel@@ ines .
there have been no st@@ agnation , and you have always added some new features because water lives and drinking water the most important food .
in her Lau@@ d@@ ati@@ o she praised her faithful , reliable and correct service over 31 years .
he was used with a lot of heart blu@@ ff@@ ing for his water @-@ purpose association , and he lived with the water @-@ purpose association , as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago , he as a real practitioner to present the success concept of the V@@ eit@@ en@@ stein@@ ach group to a nit@@ rate of nit@@ aries in front of the water forum of the district .
for this he received a lot of recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler was praised by Al@@ f@@ ons Sem@@ bel , who worked together with him for 28 years .
he is the best wat@@ ering and he was a faithful scar@@ ce .
together we were an unbeatable team .
as the highlights from his point of view , he described the Brun@@ nen@@ bau and the restructuring of the following purposes .
the biggest challenge and the hard@@ est bet were the tube end on the flood of ch@@ ur@@ ch@@ ur@@ ters on a 3rd January .
here , at minus 17 degrees had to work through the whole night so that the localities with water could be supplied .
also the supply of Neu@@ brunn , once again can only be maintained because one filled the skyscrapers of P@@ ett@@ stadt with sle@@ w .
the management of drinking water @-@ purpose association was handed over to Daniel storms from lou@@ der , who occurs the succession of Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler .

&quot; the man himself called with us and stated to have shot his li@@ festyles , &quot; said a polic@@ eman .

it is a couple of years old .
meanwhile the man is carrying a gl@@ ass@@ ze .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still carry the weapon with himself , so the police .
who sees S@@ ven S. is to call the 110 .

the relevant police in Lübeck initially wanted to make no information about the Ta@@ ther@@ ing or the relationship between perpetrators and victims , but confirmed that a human being had been killed .

steel - Licht@@ blick for German steel industry
the crises @-@ exploited and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed with additional costs in meg@@ acities .
financial bur@@ dens that thre@@ aten the industry from the green electricity promotion , are from the table .
it abi@@ des during the liberation of renewable energies in the so @-@ called self @-@ production facility in the German steel industry , the Federal Minister of Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Fre@@ ag@@ an ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am truly happy that we could finally reach negotiations after two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at first , the European Commission had initially planned to ask the steel manufacturer to request the gases from the ho@@ ok@@ fen to generate electricity for the own consumption .
the steel industry deri@@ ves additional costs of € 120 to 240 million per year according to the German industry network .
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , there is now a key certificate of agreement with the EU Commission to talks with Un@@ named Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only if the generators are replaced in the steel networks , all an EEG overthrow of 20 percent .
but also this will not be raised in the steel industry .
the IG Metall welcomed the agreement of Germany with the European Commission for self @-@ flow production .
in this way the status quo of the previous regulation will be largely determined .
special importance was the successful effort of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; steel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is this a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further needs to follow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even in the reform of the E@@ TS in climate and employment targets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated IG Metall @-@ CEO Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the financial crisis in Europe , the steel sector has suffered under over@@ capacity and a significant price of price .
last year , the situation further exac@@ erb@@ ated the situation as the world &apos;s largest producer in China in the face of the weak@@ ening of domestic demand mass@@ aging steel on the world market .
European manufacturers throw Chinese steel contra@@ sting pricing dump@@ ing .
in the course of this spring , the situation has somewhat relaxed .
for one show suspended entries on import steel effect , the economic prospects have emerged in China .
unclear is how sustainable the price is reco@@ vering .
the German industry pri@@ mus Thys@@ sen@@ K@@ rupp remained careful on Thursday .
finally , the prices would have been more stag@@ nating .
the sector is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Thys@@ sen@@ K@@ rupp did not even want to exclude the end of individual works as well .
in the German steel industry , at the end of 2015 around 8@@ 6000 people were busy .
in July , German steel manufacturers remain cau@@ tious despite increasing prices and growing orders .
they produced 3,@@ 4 million tons of good six percent less steel steel than in the same year of the same year as the economic cleaning of steel on Friday .
after a short increase in May , the set quantity went back to each other for the second month .
since the beginning of the year , production is about two percent below the prior @-@ year figure .
the association counts in the coming months thanks to improved order situation with a rising output .
community , spirit , health : sing sen@@ i@@ ores sen@@ i@@ ores
the singing has accompanied her whole life : as young girl she was in school choir , in the teacher studies , she took the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sang in a sen@@ iors .
&quot; singing is moving - emo@@ tionally and physically , &quot; describes it .
after a sample she feels balanced , cheerful and a total of living , she says .
quite by doing so , she does something good for her health and spirit .
because singing is equal from several perspectives a great hobby for sen@@ iors , says Erhard H@@ ac@@ kler by the German sen@@ iors .
most sen@@ i@@ ers sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
through regular co @-@ operation the sen@@ iors can establish and maintain social contacts .
because often social and family @-@ family structures at age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience also has made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in their choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speak and organize themselves on the others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in a positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
because the sen@@ iors exercise a deep and controlled breathing .
whoever asks his lungs regularly , but also in everyday life not so fast from the pupp@@ et .
even though it is about getting the sound of the voice in old age , S@@ ingen is an optimal hobby .
in older people , singing often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Federal Labour Association of the sen@@ iors .
in the older generations the joint struggle had a much higher place , it belonged to everyday life , both at school and in leisure time , explains them .
L@@ enz frequently observed that singing or listening of songs in older people ar@@ ouses many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth .
through Li@@ ed@@ tex@@ te and particularly melo@@ dies , even den@@ ying themselves hal@@ ted people in long lying events .
at S@@ ingen the head also requires a special achievement , explains L@@ enz .
focus at the same time on their own voice and a pre@@ determined rhythm and adapt themselves to the other singers - this is a huge cognitive challenge .
especially elderly who live alone so that not only concentrate on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition that one learns through the singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
even the self @-@ esteem grows through the singing in the choir .
to show yourself : if I do for a long time , I will be better and more vig@@ il@@ ant about me - this experience rein@@ forces .
good reasons to start with singing , so there is enough .
whoever wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he means to have little talent , betra@@ ying L@@ enz .
you &apos;re not alone - at 50 sin@@ ks people who sounds there when a sound goes next to it ?
looking for the right offer have sen@@ iors different possibilities , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
sings someone from the acquaint@@ ances in a sen@@ or@@ ench@@ or , you can just connect .
many cities also offer insights on choirs in the area .
who wants to sing in a ec@@ cl@@ esi@@ astic choir can turn directly to the church or the Church .
many sen@@ sel@@ enium choirs can also be found via the Internet .
anyone who has no access to the Internet can ask the family , friends or neighbors to help with the internet .
who desire has to sing should come to join a choir , m@@ illed H@@ ac@@ kler .
singing is doing the soul well and has something fre@@ eing - that applies to all ages .
cats react sensitive to as a cr@@ ater on the kittens of the young animals
bi@@ ologists have studied in Hanover , which effect the pack of cat@@ tery is on adult animals .
to her surprise the mi@@ xes also didn &apos;t let the males too cold - but they kept in the difference to the females always the same .
female cats can recognize the Er@@ reg@@ ain of kittens at the ch@@ ew of the little ones .
they react by ten percent faster to the foli@@ age of kittens that have been found in great need , such as scientists from the Veter@@ inary Medicine and Medical School of Hannover ( M@@ H@@ H ) .
K@@ ater also react to the herds of kittens - however always the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apparently the acoustic differences between the mi@@ ch@@ ew of less and strong ear@@ ths for the males are either not percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Bi@@ olog@@ in Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the M@@ H@@ H . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is an author@@ itarian in the study that was published on this Friday in the journal BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology . &quot;
in a previous investigation the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch @-@ height of the kittens is distinguished by the ur@@ gency of their help .
a total of nine adult K@@ ater and eight females were observed from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the M@@ H@@ H .
they were played for a model of little ones who were taken from the worm box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
for the others they were confronted with scre@@ aming of stronger kittens that were additionally elevated .
the researchers keep their results in spite of the low sample of the sample .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all females , even those who had no own offspring , re@@ acted to the hor@@ ie , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they turned up faster to the loud@@ speaker when this maturity of the very popular k@@ icks played .
this ability may be inn@@ ate or develop with the sexually mature .
&quot; one surprise was that the males at all have responded to , &quot; said the Bi@@ olog@@ in .
in the past , scientists have already examined several times in humans the reactions of women and men on bab@@ es .
some studies also showed that women were sensitive to inf@@ ants , whether they were already mothers or not , reported the Bi@@ olog@@ in Marina She@@ um@@ ann .
Po@@ dol@@ ski takes up with &quot; Gala &quot; to the Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ kiss@@ r is a football @-@ legend in Turkey .
in Turkey was issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ l@@ r .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time after the coup &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin takes place an important football game in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in front of the du@@ el of the arch@@ aic between visits Istanbul and Luke Po@@ dol@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul to the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya is the official line clear : &quot; business as &quot; is predicted .
even when it comes to the crash , after the overthrow of the crash , the government , the everyday life of norm@@ ality should not be affected .
but this does not apply to those who are susp@@ icious of the movement of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the put@@ ty trial .
thereby it is not done in front of the football .
against the earlier Star@@ k@@ icker Hak@@ an Sü@@ l@@ r , the prosecution issued an arrest warran@@ t .
according to the meantime , it is now accused in America to be a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ l@@ r is intended to be tra@@ ilers of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is held responsible by the President Rec@@ ep Tayy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan for the coup attempt .
although it is initially valid for 90 days , the most importantly , until October , in fact , it has on the life of most Turks , but as good as does not have any impact .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the closer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on public places throughout the country has declared Erdo@@ gan on Wednesday for finished . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - split in trailer and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
particularly fans of the workers &quot; club visits are traditionally not among the friends of the president .
but what &apos;s cru@@ de of the Turks , but in the face of the dramatic experiences in history , the stri@@ fe is rej@@ ecting military coup .
even so even the fans agree - no matter whether you strike your heart for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or sightseeing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will be especially coming back to Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his sporty value presented the Köl@@ ner in the exp@@ ired season : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions the 31 @-@ year @-@ old ended his first game as Top@@ scor@@ er of his association .
in the end game against Fen@@ er@@ bah@@ ce he achieved the 1 : 0 @-@ winner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; took him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he completed the season an excellent way and his team secured the cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the final season for the record had an irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the round @-@ round @-@ K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; also in the Europe League early .
in the South by Li@@ g it only flow@@ ed to rank six .
the season was not good .
the Po@@ kal was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we managed and that is the most important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master Co@@ kt@@ as , the game was better than the year .
above all thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who with 26 season accounts as an Sü@@ l@@ atex @-@ wind@@ shield the base for the 14th songs .
this is also the reason that the fans hope to return to the return of the 31 year old .
at the end of the AC Florence , the Gom@@ ez had announced only one bor@@ rowed Gom@@ ez according to the coup attempt , not to return due to the political situation in the country after its EM @-@ vacation .
&quot; if Mario still wants to come to us , he will only have to say it , &quot; commented the journal &quot; K@@ icker &quot; club manager Fi@@ Cre@@ t Or@@ man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the storms should be ready to reno@@ un@@ ce around a third of his to 7.5 million Euros valued . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his sal@@ ary in Florence can we not pay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite intelligence : these athletes still have medals @-@ chances at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin was already locked twice due to D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - Whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ owa must not start in Rio .
others over@@ led athle@@ tics s@@ inner can only laugh - they are fighting in Rio for medals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic doping still determines the head@@ lines for the Olympic Games in Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Russian s@@ wimm@@ ers in Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ ova , who had received its start right shortly before the games was stopped at her start ( 100 meters chest ) mer@@ ciful .
it offered itself a sk@@ ating scenario : with a set @-@ up smile she had stum@@ bled into the hall and had prov@@ oked with her appearance .
as a state that she won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke into a J@@ ub@@ el@@ storm .
but there are many more athletes , who in Rio Olympics are going to start at the Olympic Games in Rio .
here an overview :
Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in the athle@@ tics .
he was locked for two times because of D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
since his spell the Olympi@@ as of 2004 and ex @-@ world master works even faster than before , it is over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds the number one in the world and is considered to be the biggest challenge of Uz@@ ain Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / Jama@@ ica ) : the two @-@ time Olympics in 2010 to sit a six @-@ month lock after you have proved the intake of pain kill@@ ers by Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
after a surgery they had severe tooth@@ ache , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old had defended themselves .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Dis@@ cus / Croatia ) : in 2011 the Olympics of 2012 , World Championship in 2013 and European Championship in 2010 was positively tested on the forbidden stim@@ ul@@ ant instruments of meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ ane @-@ amin .
Per@@ kovic denied the wis@@ ely intake and was locked six months .
the four most common lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the large gold fav@@ ors .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ tre@@ k ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ season ) : the Beijing Olympics and two @-@ time world @-@ champion over 400 m , was positively tested and 21 months have been blocked .
a means of penis enlargement would have been responsible , beg@@ ged Mer@@ enters .
this year the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is over 200 and 400 m of the so far quick@@ est man in the world .
I@@ wan Ti@@ ch@@ on ( Hammer@@ ing , Belarus ) : probably hardly any ath@@ lete have been detected as many medals as well .
so , Ti@@ ch@@ on lost its world championship title from 2005 nine years later , after having noticed testosterone intelligence .
the now 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to give Olympics silver 2004 because of ster@@ oid D@@ op@@ ings and the EM @-@ titles 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
the Bronze Medal of the Olympic Games in 2008 was given back to a judgment of the International Sports Court of Justice .
with 80@@ ,@@ 04 m he is placed on rank two of the world @-@ tran@@ sect list .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km G@@ ehen , China ) : the World Teacher and Gold@@ fav@@ ori@@ tin was only positive in May , but may still start in Rio .
at the 29 year old world , references to the intake of a wast@@ ed dietary supplement was found , the spar@@ re of the world @-@ anti @-@ doping agency W@@ ada fell mi@@ de and ran on 13 July already .
Bom@@ b@@ enter@@ ror in Thailand - Ost@@ rei@@ cher@@ in in@@ ju@@ red - Mehr@@ ere T@@ ote
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand stands in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Ministry , Thomas L@@ ö@@ ll , Fre@@ etown early .
she suffered schn@@ it@@ tw@@ ard and be treated in the hospital , but have already left it again .
your home trip I planned for early September .
whether from other explo@@ sions on the holiday island of Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ om@@ on are also affected by the Austrian citizen , is still unclear .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stand in close contact with the local authorities , as quick@@ est .
at about 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , H@@ in were initially explo@@ ded on Thursday night in a footh@@ old of two bom@@ bs .
according to the police , the police were killed and about 20 people were wounded , including the Ost@@ rei@@ cher@@ in , three German , three Dutch and three Italians .
Friday morning went once again two spar@@ row rates , and according to the authorities , a further person was killed .
also by Ph@@ u@@ ket , a bom@@ b of bom@@ bs was reported in the morning .
at the Det@@ on@@ ation in the vicinity of the popular pebble beach Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver has been violated .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , at the southeast coast of the country , then there was another bom@@ b which killed an urban centre .
the explo@@ sives was according to the authorities in a flower be@@ et in front of the re@@ four of the coastal police in the air .
finally , there are no det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast , as well as in the ch@@ asing on the south @-@ east coast several times .
it is from a connection to the explo@@ sions in Hua H@@ in , it was called .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bom@@ b attacks carry the same manual , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said army of Dan@@ ai Cher@@ eth@@ av@@ ee Fri@@ ag@@ eing early to journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that it is a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is too early to express themselves at possible motives - probably it is about the actions of Muslim rebels . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Thai media also wanted to recognise a pattern in the attacks , which is typical for the bom@@ bing of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
on the other hand , the Thai police stated that the attacks are not related to the Islam@@ ist movement or with the international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ ot@@ age , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one assumes the bom@@ bs of opponents were laid by opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities would have been able to receive secrets of imp@@ ending attacks in the south of the country in the past few days - however , they have not been informed about the exact time and places . &quot; &quot; &quot;
don &apos;t let the group get behind the attacks .
the police took its officials throughout the country to enhance security around important government buildings as well as airports , stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and am@@ usement districts .
in Thailand there are always smaller bom@@ bing stops , but they are usually not directed against tourists .
in Hua H@@ in is a palace that was used over the years of Thailand , King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bo@@ l Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
after the wake @-@ up bom@@ b explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to adhere to the instructions of the Thai security authorities .
high safety risk ( security level 3 ) led for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ iw@@ ate , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah Vi@@ ews and its surroundings .
according to disputes between security forces and Muslim populations , there will be no necessary travel in these provinces .
increased safety risk ( security level 2 ) for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday were successful a few days after a controversial referendum on one of the military jun@@ ta negotiated constitution .
this allows the military to influence the military power in the coming years .
jun@@ ta boss and prime minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ Ch@@ a said that bom@@ bs were an attempt to sti@@ p@@ ate chaos , while the country moving towards stability , an improvement of economic situation and tourism .
the Mil@@ itä@@ ran@@ ta , which had taken power in 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest the power holds itself to have led the kingdom again to stability and order .
however , it did not succeed in the military to get a handle under the extreme south of the country for years in the extreme south of the country .
more than 6@@ 500 people have been killed in the conflict .
almost one year ago , in Bangkok there were a popular Hind@@ u @-@ shr@@ ine 20 people in Bangkok - most of them have foreign tourists .
it was the bloody attack of the younger history of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; improvis@@ ational movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the sight of the federal state for constitutional protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to several govern@@ ors , the Constitutional Court also made the league in the covenant the group under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; improvis@@ ational movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for aspirations against the free democratic principles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said constitutional manager Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate of the German press @-@ agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus the emig@@ rants of Islamic faith or the Middle East are diff@@ used in a extrem@@ ist manner .
that is why we are watching the movement well .
the &quot; I@@ den@@ thal movement &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it applies to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mul@@ tic@@ ult@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity by est@@ ran@@ gement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Con@@ vent in nine Bundes@@ länder - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thur@@ in@@ gia - observe the &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ els &quot; already .
Ma@@ ate said , his authority was closely aligned with the country &apos;s decision .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups such as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ den@@ unci@@ ars &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; try their target group , where it stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Constitutional Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
generally , they are trying to speak with you@@ just language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the identi@@ ties of Islam@@ ists just as right @-@ wing extremi@@ sts .
this is not extra advertising for one &apos;s own thing .
the propaganda should address the people emotional .
young people are sus@@ cep@@ tible here in a special way .
this is dangerous .
last but most recently , there were reports of contacts of the &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ els &quot; to Af@@ D @-@ politicians .
Ma@@ ate said , he did not have any knowledge .
for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this species occur only from a certain point .
it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain individuals , which are extrem@@ ist , its goal , and thus becomes extrem@@ ist extrem@@ ist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , if such individuals have control over the Party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not recognizable .
with a view to the marked increase of rights @-@ motivated crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee income , Ma@@ ate said he would not speak of new right terrorism in this context .
however , in recent years we have found that it can be right @-@ r@@ or@@ ist structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Fre@@ edi@@ an Group .
it may be quite that other right @-@ or@@ r@@ or@@ ist group@@ ings or small groups form the attacks against asylum seekers , against refugee centres or attack from other far @-@ right motives .
however , a nationwide or pan @-@ wide control of legitimacy is not recognizable .
the existing groups were ar@@ isen on the regional level or in social networks .
concerned , Ma@@ ate pointed out that lots of over@@ sight went to the account of people who previously did not appear in the right scene .
this is the worrying .
many of the Tat@@ susp@@ ects in asylum seekers were not known as crimin@@ als , politically motivated prosecution or supporters of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people have committed off@@ ences which were previously not at the guard previously with right @-@ wing extremi@@ sts , which were perhaps politically in@@ different , or for example , CD@@ U , SPD or left were elected radical by far @-@ wing extremis@@ m mo@@ ods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ its becomes an inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
the Olympi@@ ics or world records are not always determining the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the brave appearance of RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te during the summer playing in Rio de Janeiro .
in the Aqu@@ atics Center sw@@ am the slightly exagger@@ ated s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia is so slow that he was no longer seeing in the TV images temporarily .
it just disappeared - no matter how far the exp@@ ulsion was selected .
in social networks he became the viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old with a return of 48 seconds has its prec@@ inc@@ ision and defeated the 5@@ 9th place of 59 starter .
but it was rather his not a sporty figure , which attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still participates at the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ians got a special start from international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ presented countries more well @-@ known .
because in Ethiopia the most ath@@ lete run , he wanted to do something different .
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly the first nick@@ name did the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some media marked him as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; RO@@ BE@@ L &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; based on a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prosperity &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was funny with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time he struck at first with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters of Fre@@ est@@ l , it didn &apos;t play a role .
compare with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
at the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney , the run by Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i for medi@@ al attention .
memorable was the appearance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ atorial Guinea , when he had to take over 100 meters of fre@@ isti@@ l alone .
f@@ ren@@ e@@ tically was rep@@ uted by M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i at that time .
the 22 @-@ year old took only eight months before Olympia and had never seen such a long distance before the competition .

details wanted a corporate speaker on Friday not call .

in An@@ le@@ ger@@ te circles , it was on Friday , with shareholders &apos; last but last the disappointment about the continued success of the years introduced re@@ initiated .
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been at the Gf@@ K top since 2011 .

the 66 years old car from the bus company from Eisen@@ ach had to devi@@ ate according to its details according to a tick that is partly on the counter@@ way .
the bus got off right from the street and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch as a spokes@@ person in the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; due to the location of the bus , people could not leave the bus self @-@ permanently , &quot; she said .
the fire@@ men liber@@ ates the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and a general practitioner came to the accident on the provincial road 2 .
the un@@ last travelers were brought by a regular bus back to the Karp@@ ac@@ us@@ ner district P@@ ew@@ around .

the fees per cu@@ bic meters of wast@@ ew@@ ater will take place from 1 October 2016 for the area of se@@ wage gas station Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sh / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3,@@ 36 Euro ( so far 2.@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 euro ( so far 2.@@ 18 euros ) .
in the plant in Az@@ endorf the wast@@ ew@@ ater fee will then be increased once again if appropriate improvement measures will be necessary .
after a r@@ ack@@ et rate , the se@@ wage price in Az@@ endorf will then lie at 4.@@ 37 euro per cu@@ bic meters .
as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported that the approval of the household was determined by the Land@@ rat@@ ory Kul@@ mb@@ ach that runs for these se@@ wage systems .
the market Kas@@ endorf was obliged to operate the plant on the basis of a legal basis .
from 1 October 2016 , the citizens and the commercial and industrial companies from world stake , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Z@@ ult@@ enberg , have to take deep into the budgets .
the stir@@ ring increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
as Chairman of the Board of Directors Herbert Schmidt has shown the body , a re@@ calculation of fees for the se@@ wage systems of the market community was necessary .
in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 there are also over@@ - or sub @-@ covers from the preceding calcul@@ ating period .
the gra@@ vi@@ ating ag@@ it@@ ational ag@@ ni@@ ers founded Schmidt thus that it is possible with all three se@@ wage systems by relatively small facilities with a very low waste water tank , which fly between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cu@@ bic meters per year .
thus due to the low distribution of distribution , for example , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand Euros would have a grave impact .
in addition , the se@@ wage of water in all three plants is slightly declined .
furthermore , the calculation period is not least due to its age , not least because of its age and repair expenses in a significant circum@@ ference .
the plant in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the facilities for world stake , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Z@@ ult@@ enberg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p almost 20 years .
Schmidt denied that in the se@@ wage plant Al@@ endorf the mechanical ventilation system had to be exchanged due to a damage .
the p@@ umping Wel@@ ch machine had to over@@ hau@@ led the nearly 20 years old con@@ veying systems for almost 20 years and in the pond area of Lop@@ p , after nearly 20 years of operation the first se@@ wage ru@@ ff@@ led , det@@ oxi@@ fy and an additional v@@ ents can be installed in order to keep the water @-@ legal requirements even in future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these extraordinary expenses came to consider these extraordinary super@@ vis@@ ing and maintenance costs , which are to be taken into account according to the new sp@@ readsheet period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which in the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 were still clear under the current level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; stone houses made clear that after low waste water fall in the three systems put the expenses for operation and maintenance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , added Schmidt , the market community of great entertainment costs in se@@ wage systems in the past 20 years has remained spar@@ ed .
the situation for the mentioned plants will continue to be prec@@ arious according to stone houses in the long run , especially since they could not extend the supply area of the se@@ wage @-@ purpose Fri@@ esen@@ b@@ acht@@ al around these systems because it is the deficit facilities .

the annual average de@@ flation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured by the CP@@ I -@@ 0.@@ 8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.@@ 0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) amoun@@ ted to 0.3 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 amoun@@ ted to 0.3 % .

Sn@@ ap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect as Asian caric@@ ature critici@@ zed
Sn@@ ap@@ chat says that this filter is Ani@@ me @-@ inspired , but some observers say that it is impro@@ per cent to races .
with his filtering tool , it allows sn@@ ap@@ chat about 150 million daily users to change the reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that is already absurd .
you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure which might be from a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting .
the filters are un@@ bloo@@ ded , especi@@ al tools , which generate over 30 million improved sel@@ ectiv@@ es per day .
all mis@@ steps will reach the public .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat filters have drawn criticism in the past , in which they were accused , that the app has been shaped of Black@@ face or white skin as beauty ideal .
when this week some users proposed a filter that gave them s@@ ling , false teeth and troubled che@@ eks , there were some critics called a rac@@ ist caric@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; gels . &quot;
they asked yourself whether these repeti@@ tive controllers pointed to a larger problem that the company has with diversity .
the news and the indi@@ gn@@ ation were widely spread on Wednesday with reports from The Ver@@ ge and motherboard , one day after Sn@@ ap@@ chat , that it would have been disabled .
the company had an ap@@ ology : the filter was meant as hom@@ age to Ani@@ me @-@ characters and not as caric@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders that have experienced Rass@@ is@@ sm , reminded the filter at hur@@ t@@ ful Kl@@ is@@ che@@ es .
other reason@@ ed the anim@@ e @-@ comparison decided .
in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , an Korean @-@ American art student whose t@@ we@@ et over the photos were widely used that the filter was &quot; hur@@ t@@ ful and eas@@ ed . &quot;
she added that &quot; it was difficult to argue with the counter@@ position of a very conflic@@ ting Asian caric@@ ature and the filter effects .
it shows that the filter is not @-@ sigh@@ ted , but that the terrain was drawn up to the decreasing extremi@@ m .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses these cultural movements .
the American culture seems to be implic@@ ated in an endless seal and integration , from meeting rooms up to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand .
and Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats great audience of young people - who are in the matter of race as their older counter @-@ players - could be expected rather to expect sensitivity .
if one is created by Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats filtering a picture is so much more difficult , that such things remain un@@ noticed when it was the case , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday decided Z@@ hu , who works as a product manager and engineering in the medium to delete their Sn@@ ap@@ chat account and ordered others to do the same .
in an essay for medium and in a telephone interview she said they believe that rac@@ ist controversy is a lack of diversity among the employment practices at Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu critici@@ zed the big part white , only male leaders and ended up with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ ete@@ Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
&quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese me @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that are working there , but are not in locations where they feel safe or comfortable in order to say something about it . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint , the Sn@@ ap@@ chat mostly un@@ answered .
the company does not publish figures on the diversity of its employees and points to its status as a private company .
on Thursday , there was Sn@@ ap@@ chat to discuss the cultural backgrounds of his staff , but according to a spokes@@ person , the company recently focused on a personnel responsible for focused population groups and on internal integration efforts .
Z@@ hu said in turn her sn@@ ap@@ chat account will be closed and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that that is not OK . &quot;
military ab@@ fal@@ se@@ hood ISIS &apos; intelligence , represents the Committee of Congress
military @-@ related information about the United States Central Command , modified information to draw an optimum image of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , as it would have allowed the actual states on site , the congress committee in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of Republi@@ can members of the dispute , secret service of ees and the defensive budget , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction under Central Command intelligence services , who reported how superi@@ ors changed their estim@@ ations to the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , shortly C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in Tamp@@ a , Florida , which controls the American military per@@ mut@@ ations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; news of the information provided by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com Kom@@ man@@ de@@ es typically were a posi@@ ti@@ ver@@ ge picture of the American efforts against terrorism as it would have allowed the actual states on site and were typical positive as analyses of other news services , &quot; commented an article article .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what has happened at Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer , when poor analyses are presented our political leaders , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ken Cal@@ vert , republi@@ can Member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the man@@ ag@@ it@@ ches in the Cent@@ Com range up to the top top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report presents detailed instructions in recent years of 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the education of the Iraqi army .
although there is no direct evidence that Government spi@@ kes under Obama has given instructions to change the reports , it shows how an@@ alysts got exposed to the pressure from their superi@@ ors , an optimal image of the threat of the Islamic state , also known as ISIS or Isi@@ l .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half year 2015 , many Central Command press releases , opinions and statements before the Congress was clearly more positive than it corresponds to the facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concluded the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ Com An@@ no@@ ger was publicly known that a military re @-@ conquest mos@@ s can already be started in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ su@@ l , second largest city in Iraq remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigations , so much clearly said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pei , Republi@@ can Congress of Congress in K@@ ans@@ as , in an opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the peaks of Central Command had changed the official reports to play the danger of ISIS in Iraq .
the re@@ public@@ ans called the Task Force to life , after they played , an@@ alysts were worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic state .
the report published on Thursday will still be completed by detailed findings during investigations .
further investigations of Cent@@ Com reports are in progress by the General Secretary of Defence .
democratic Members of the Message Board , published on Thursday their own findings , which coinci@@ des with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com has created an over@@ hau@@ ly reserved process for the creation of retro@@ spective assessment of Isi@@ l and the Iraqi Security Services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave the highest priority democr@@ at in the compromise , member of the House of Represent@@ atives Adam B. ship , in an opinion known . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , so Mr. Shi@@ p , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed the publication of downstream reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; s@@ worn the morality under an@@ alysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave over little room for different opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Mr. Shi@@ p and Democrats have given no evidence to have found evidence on an intervention of the White House at the Cent@@ Com analy@@ st with respect to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; specific political opinion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigations were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported by investig@@ ating the General In@@ spec@@ tor of the Pentagon , which were taken after complaints from Cent@@ Com analy@@ st .
Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ d@@ r. Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pres@@ ent@@ pre@@ cher of the Pentagon , gave in an opinion that the Defence Ministry had no reports of Congress , while the investigation of the general practitioner is still under way .
but he also gave that &quot; experts sometimes quite diver@@ ting opinions concerning the interpretation of complex data and that the intelligence services and the Department of Defence will welcome a controversy on these important topics of national defence . &quot;
the investigations on the question of a successful a@@ ign campaign led by American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a claim that is made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) .
however , the accus@@ ations of last year have raised the question , how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest and military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism of the secret information on the Islamic State remin@@ is@@ cent of more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a writing about how the then government under George W. Bush against the recommendations of many an@@ alysts examine only a small occupation of occupation in Iraq and have little time to concentrate on the consequences of the invasion of 2003 .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the revol@@ t against the current coverage of the Islamic State .
last year , the team led by Mr. Hoo@@ ker to provide Mr. Hoo@@ ker to dis@@ regard the statements of the government attacks against those from the Islamic State and had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , since these tent@@ ative refinement had put into operation to sell oil on the black market .
however , this knowledge was not published , reported the Times in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ al Command holder , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legis@@ lat@@ ure for his over@@ ly positive assessment of the war situation during a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin was reti@@ ring in April and was replaced by the Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the United States wins fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey of women , a show@@ down with Great Britain .
one day after they had shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 winner over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates for the American Feld@@ ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the American players won with 3 @-@ 0 .
five gates in two games should actually represent a decent performance , but messenger ( 27 ) said they could not remember that have ever done .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their gates in memory .
however , that knows they : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are equal in their group with the Britain on the first place , after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will meet for the first round on Saturday in the last game .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ finals , the game will decide which of the two within their group will gain the first and second place in each group .
the first@@ plat@@ former will take a little longer from the path that the other group will lead .
as always the game may go on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising verteb@@ ra@@ e by their success story , four years after they landed in the past London games on the last of 12 places .
B@@ AM was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a ho@@ ckey game in hands ( their two older sisters played the sport at Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became a national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
they missed the Olympi@@ ad in 2008 , since they could not qualify for the cad@@ res .
then came the year 2012 in which for her and her team everything went wrong .
in the following year Craig Par@@ n@@ ham became an Engl@@ ish@@ man , trainer of the national team and thus began to contact things for better .
&quot; a cultural change , a mental transition and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am .
we did not have the working time in London , which we now have .
we have the rod completely ro@@ cking .
on Thursday evening , B@@ am the Tor@@ ri@@ gen opened in the first half of the game with a handle from the local area .
India was gone without victory in the tournament into the game , but the team showed itself surprisingly strong and kept the pitch from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter , until B@@ am the game took up into their hands .
she led a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left side f@@ lange , then moved to the middle and lu@@ te the ball into the gate around the Americ@@ an@@ ers to get a 2 @-@ 0 guidance .
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ zal@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the entire tournament for the Tor@@ ke@@ eper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs who had to advance a gate in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
just as well as B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday .
middle of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline
wherever you are , how late it is , it is the Olympic Games .
the events in Rio de Janeiro feel consistently and in@@ different , a rapid stag@@ gering to competition and aspir@@ ation .
it is , as if the olymp@@ ic tor@@ ch itself would be a burning stub@@ born from the w@@ rist@@ band to the swimming pool to the gymn@@ ast to the tri@@ ath@@ l@@ ahs .
you can not switch on TV to read a newspaper or listen to a conversation at the Coff@@ ee@@ pers in the Coff@@ ee@@ shop without hearing from Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ cher or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is also Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s warm with gr@@ ats , could quite be sent among these known names , built up to Prime Time , constru@@ cting through sponsors and charity , if he would be s@@ wimm@@ ers , tur@@ ner or even feet .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fighting in the olymp@@ ic trampoline for gold .
the olymp@@ ic flame does not illuminated any event in the same way .
further from the center , partly in the shade are the sports which are not generally accepted : air pist@@ ol shoot , ar@@ chery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ w@@ ondo .
we will always have the breast swim and may have dom@@ inion it for a long time .
but if I might make modest arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , then let me draw attention to the discreet char@@ me of the trampoline .
although the trampoline has been a Olympic event already since 2000 , a Olympic event had already seen as it had been in Sydney , it was the last 16 years so spar@@ se that many those , I had questioned did not know that there is a Olympi@@ ad of the Olympics .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the USA sent athletes to competition , there has never been a medal in the trampoline , and had had a ath@@ lete with up to 2012 .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and the Can@@ adi@@ ans to share for women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
the trampoline has a certain out@@ si@@ iter@@ ate char@@ me , partly because it sounds for the un@@ enligh@@ tened ear suitable for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ school than that sounds for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a sublime enthusi@@ ast .
it has humor@@ ous potential - cart@@ o@@ on@@ ous tre@@ mb@@ ling of his never to end clou@@ ding - but also the Grazie of turn@@ around and diving , the two sports that it essentially united .
the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means so much like &quot; spring@@ board . &quot;
emerging winner jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements ( rotating , pi@@ per and o@@ tos ) before they land on your feet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are evaluated according to official Olympi@@ ad after execution , difficulty and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flight time &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two @-@ rounded athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , are competing in Rio .
the most common Olympic V@@ ector is straight .
med@@ alli@@ sts need to go further in their quest for gold faster , upwards and beyond , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes back and back , upwards and down on the playground .
they not only hunt the finish line or the output wall , but also in television transmission : the world or the Olympi@@ ad of the Olympi@@ ans .
the pur@@ pos@@ e@@ ful endeavour is pos@@ h , admir@@ able , even fan@@ ati@@ cal - and it is enough to even sc@@ atter@@ ing a viewer to tears .
but it is also what I think even when looking at these games as something er@@ ti@@ res@@ ome .
of this , the trampoline offers a re@@ pri@@ eve .
the vector of the trampoline is the top .

&quot; a Generation protest &quot; in Ethiopia , Long An ally of the USA
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators , the political changes in Ethiopia are calling for violent resistance to the government .
witnesses say that sev@@ enty men were killed while the clash with the police were killed .
is Ethiopia just going to break together ?
in the last ten years it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid allies of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in recent months the protests against the government sha@@ ken the country and spread in ever more areas .
last week thousands of people rus@@ hed to streets and demanded political changes .
the answer of the government was un@@ mer@@ ciful to human rights organizations .
witnesses believe that polic@@ emen were shot in zig un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators and sle@@ w .
moving across the protests , which are probably from the last or beginning of this year , show how security people are young people with sticks , while these were forced to make a hand against a wall .
the head of the UN High Authority for Human Rights is now calling for an out@@ going investigation .
&quot; it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in future it becomes even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa the International Crisis Group , a research group .
Ethiopia is to Nigeria the most populated country of Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West .
American military and intelligence services work closely with Ethiop@@ ians to fight terrorism across the region , especially in Somalia . only few countries in Africa , if at all , they get much Western help .
Ethiop@@ ian economy expanded in a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new shift in the capital Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
the streets are generally quiet , safe and clean .
even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organizations have continued the oppression of the government - the opposition in the country has been limited , with dis@@ sid@@ ents were effectively brought to silence .
many were sent to exile or in prison , killed or put in the wilderness of the wilderness .
but that could change .
&quot; if you supp@@ ress people and do not have any other options except prot@@ es@@ ing it breaks off , &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in Central Ethiop@@ ian .
the entire youth protest .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous ail@@ ments that cover everything from the ground use up to the stran@@ gle@@ hold in terms of power of the ruling coalition .
after a further critici@@ zed election last year , the ruling party and its allies gained the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament .
at the same time , the tensions continue along the border to Eritrea ; a struggle for this jag@@ ged , controversial line called for June hundreds of lives .
analy@@ st fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the Oro@@ mo @-@ Liber@@ ation Front or the National Liber@@ ation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , which have been imposed more or less imposed over the past few years , they could ar@@ ming the turbul@@ ence .
several factors explain why feelings of the bit@@ ing after years of the wor@@ sen@@ ing under the surface now explo@@ de .
the first seems to be harmless : smartphones .
only in recent years a lot of Ethiopia have been able to communicate with social media because cheap smartphones have been more frequently and improved the internet services .
even if the government has access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do at regular intervals , especially when protests , doing , many people can still communicate about Internet pro@@ x@@ ies who conce@@ al where they are staying .
several young Ethiop@@ ians gave to that they were so called to protein .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ cities in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
for e@@ ons of prosp@@ ered the Am@@ har@@ as , which come from Ethiopia in the most Christian countries , in politics and economics , while she exploited the Oro@@ mos , many of which are Muslims and live in low@@ land areas .
but this is also changing .
&quot; we are here to coordinate under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos .
the biggest protests found in areas of the Am@@ hara and Oro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray , which accounts for around 6 percent of the population and which are dominant in the military , in commerce and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebellion of vine , was up to his death on a not sovereign disease in 2012 17 years of Ethiop@@ ian prime minister .
he was seen as tac@@ tical genius ; a man who could think of corners .
an@@ alysts say that he was particularly well vers@@ ed in order to use early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and to use special officers to deal with opponents and make them be harmful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime lacks it in this fundamental skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiop@@ ians new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen by relatively un@@ supervised reasons to take the position of Mr Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr Mel@@ es , who came out of the Tig@@ ray of Northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south .
an@@ alysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence that controlled by the Tig@@ ray controls .
many fear that the outcome will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time Ethiopia was a rebellion of such a tur@@ mo@@ il , after thousands of elections prot@@ ested , according to an@@ alysts , apparently , were seemingly fu@@ ged from the government and subsequently stolen .
during the following swe@@ eps many demonstr@@ ators were killed , even if it was less than in the past few months , and this time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly .
Ethiop@@ ian leaders Ethiop@@ ians leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , like the new pel@@ let move , as well as for its measurable progress in poverty reduction .
but obviously this does not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal mis@@ sal of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it adop@@ ts a dangerous ethnic form .
the last month of attacks in gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ an city , of Tig@@ ray , and the hatred of the Tig@@ ray , becomes more and more common in social media .
an@@ alysts are saying that the protests of the US and other Western allies bring together a peculi@@ ar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ gen @-@ flights over the neighboring Somalia , even if she met recently that she has closed this base .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he does not want his allies collap@@ sing in a already vol@@ ati@@ le area . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin ridge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp is explaining his claim Obama has established ISIS &apos; sar@@ cas@@ m &apos;
Donald J. Tru@@ mp was trying to dis@@ si@@ p@@ ate the last controversy on Friday that surrounds his campaign by introducing his multiple repeated asser@@ tion , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the Islamic State , not seriously meant .
these clari@@ fications put new questions on the communic@@ ability of the presidential data of the Republi@@ can to whether he is able to communicate clearly and understand with the American public .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it also brings his fellow @-@ off@@ ites who make efforts to take him during an event@@ ful phase in protection , to explain in the peculi@@ ar position , statements that he could not have meant at all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after having made the hint at a voting event on Wednesday night , Mr. Tru@@ mp was made regarding the claim on Thursday and consisted in interviews that he really did not intend to suggest the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS .
but in an early morning T@@ we@@ et on Friday said Mr. Tru@@ mp , he is just Sar@@ sar@@ cas@@ tically .
the T@@ we@@ et was contrary to the previous day when Mr. Tru@@ mp said in a number of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation totally seriously .
when the conservative radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tru@@ mp wanted to weak@@ en the statement a little weak@@ en it by reminded him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy it , the Republi@@ can presidential did@@ did@@ acy did not know anything about it .
the last storm of the cri@@ tique cr@@ ush@@ ed on Mr. Tru@@ mp , while he tries to direct the focus of his campaign because of falling transformations to the economic situation .
Mr. Tru@@ mp and Mrs. Clinton kept the speeches of the economic situation in Michigan in this week .
on Friday Mr. Tru@@ mp was trying to return to this topic again .
on Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clin@@ tons proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring .
Mr. Tru@@ mp has already earned sar@@ cas@@ m already to its defence .
at the end of July he said strong criticism of himself , when he said , the Russians should h@@ acking Mrs. Clin@@ tons E@@ emails , but he later said &quot; Natural I said the sar@@ cas@@ tic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tru@@ mp to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic boundaries in politics and then cut back as needed .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages are taken from his fans , as they arrive , and then appropriate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on how the reaction fails . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I also believe it is clever enough to keep his statements v@@ ague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways .
instead of making the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tru@@ mp has still assumed an estim@@ able sound , since its re@@ frac@@ tures would continue to go back .
a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist who was released on Friday showed a guided tour with a big advantage in the federal states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head @-@ race in Florida .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while Mr. Tru@@ mp is generally tried to apologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often accused his critics , his statements to dist@@ ort or his humor wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but while he is strengthened in the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s jo@@ kes have brought his loyal fellow @-@ arms into the un@@ comfortable situation , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative may also be his statements .
Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tru@@ mp@@ s prominent inter@@ c@@ essors , gave great effort to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview on Thursday .
&quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; Mr. Giuli@@ ani , he said to the correctness of Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s said statements , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State .
it is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown , small organisation , he called her backgrounds , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq .
most mainstre@@ am re@@ public@@ ans try to argue that the government served under Obama , in the Mrs. Clinton as a Foreign Minister , ISIS &apos; allowed to spread out to spread the situation in the Middle East more aggressi@@ vely .
before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp continued his attacks on the media and cast them off to ride on each of his words and be taken against it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he desp@@ ised the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , j@@ äm@@ mer@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; TV expert who try to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You Can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the Democrats sp@@ un about Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s ap@@ ology as a further proof that he is in@@ appropriate for the presidential system .
once more down the price of the market , Café in Green@@ point comes back
Ver@@ b Cafe was a s@@ worn coffee shop in Williamsburg , in which one could pay only cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi but for 15 years in good coffee .
of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue has been exp@@ elled .
the shop So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , the verb in the summer of 2014 was sold , sold soap in the form of C@@ up@@ cakes .
native to people than the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fied city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ ar wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I can still don &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB dead , the Chelsea Hotel , and Ver@@ b is now an soap store . &quot;
but when New York is changing then it is also new discovery .
a res@@ bel@@ ated Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same employees and a similar atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long @-@ time employee of the old cafes , the owner and managing director of the new café .
he began working in 2001 and remained there until the end .
when he offered a customer to provide money la@@ wing for a new out@@ post , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ guez , 36 , be@@ held much .
verb uses the same distributor for the Bag@@ els bought the same es@@ presso machine .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ guez told that he wanted to experiment with .
he led new ingredients .
on the menu is sand@@ wi@@ ches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are sh@@ ni@@ dation like cap@@ ers and sau@@ cep@@ ted oni@@ ons .
there are natural preser@@ ves .
the café serves no beer more , but there is fresh juice .
after nine months Rodri@@ guez said that he had noticed a steady stream of old master customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old customers were also pushed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; awards from Williamsburg &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently on a Sunday was Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira one such customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Williamsburg and visited the verb regularly .
even after they had moved to Green@@ point , they would take the way up .
after the verb had closed , she gave a while the coffee sink , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was clear that there was coffee and culture in the verb &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she has coffee again , even if they ordered a Bl@@ ended C@@ hai Tea , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a further long@@ time and loyal customer since the beginning of the verb .
he went there before the work and ordered un@@ pret@@ end always being the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket clock and they prepare my Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment and record new ingredients in the menu .
nowadays , Ros@@ enthal always gets his usual place , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ guez said that he had no gro@@ ll about that the soap @-@ business has taken the old business room .
in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , offered a special soap for verb with the cold @-@ cooked coffee of the café as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will go back to her offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ guez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional , Polish inhabitants Green@@ points have also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated the menu into the Polish and Rodri@@ guez said that he pres@@ umed to expose them soon , so that his new neighbors will feel welcome .
the site also has other advantages .
a local saf@@ ari venue wants to fill and sell coffee into wine bottles .
there is a chance that the café is expan@@ se on a dis@@ advant@@ aged building .
for many customers a new verb is enough to get their old favorites .
Joseph WIT@@ T was a master deed and said that he was destroyed on the ground , when the cafe closed .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ ose said that the praying of the local and the mind felt a new coff@@ ees as a home@@ coming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had to sm@@ elled this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; an abundant meal &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his climb to the President , Franklin Del@@ ano Roos@@ evelt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as a g@@ our@@ mets , President Roos@@ evelt had a F@@ ai@@ ble for refined delicacies of Fi@@ fth Avenue such as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie Col@@ as and Maryland Water@@ fall soup .
his menu on this day was something humble : filled eggs in tomato sauce , potato p@@ ree and as dessert a p@@ fl@@ au@@ men@@ p@@ ud@@ ding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man .
her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how to eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food histor@@ ian .
Co@@ es last book &quot; Cho@@ p Su@@ ey &quot; acted by the Chinese cuisine in the U.S. , while brick in her book &quot; 97 Orchard &quot; has been telling about living in a residential house at the Lower East Side of the food perspective .
their latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal &quot; which is published on Tuesday at the Har@@ per publisher , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
you showed culinary solidarity as they meet with a re@@ porter in the Eisen@@ berg &apos;s sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , schn@@ ör@@ k@@ ell@@ os@@ em Im@@ bis@@ s at the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which is already in the business since the IP@@ Y , 1929 .
brick , 54 , ordered a fresh water @-@ lined with olive @-@ piece , while Co@@ e , 57 , Tru@@ th@@ ahn with potato p@@ ei@@ ree and vegetables ate .
when the re@@ porter was ordered , this was the pair of a discussion about the food in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rich foods were very popular &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was pe@@ an@@ uss@@ bro@@ t , liver , and B@@ ohn@@ en@@ bro@@ t .
they were prepared by an ingredient and a little cheap , which is the ingredient .
imagine so many pe@@ an@@ uts to eat that they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ e gr@@ in@@ ste .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have laid down in the stomach like the lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression was the table in a American household , especially in rural areas , an All @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
cre@@ ws of women bo@@ iled for male field workers and it was served freshly baked past@@ ed for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the first World War . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A Square &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stands out the way in which the country turned out to be no more the lar@@ k @-@ weapon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when eating for the Americans was a central , tense theme , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gi@@ fted Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just as tense was the new budget : mysterious foods such as aves and cas@@ ser@@ ol@@ len have been revi@@ ved to stap@@ le food , the Kas@@ ser@@ ol@@ le as a &quot; wonderful way , eating places re @-@ confi@@ dently , because chefs were able to hide non @-@ appe@@ tizing ingredients under a cre@@ am@@ y sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap drying .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meat , which was for years the center of American cuisine has become a rare luxury . &quot; &quot; &quot;
peculi@@ ar compounds have been tried , because a high @-@ cal@@ orie and nour@@ ishing satisfaction had priority before taste or even healthy chef .
during her research for the book , which also includes recipes , brick a dish made of this era , baked oni@@ ons with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a popular addition to noon &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zi@@ egel@@ man continues its way : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked oni@@ ons do not fit to each other .
it was typical for many of the house@@ wives .
as never before or since then , harsh fiscal costs - including Louise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - the eating habits of the country such as such .
by showing recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; household leaders &quot; and the challenge to transform Pamp@@ e as cre@@ am@@ h@@ etti with car@@ rots in delicious meals to be justified .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a celebration of historic tit@@ bits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in particular , the reports of the answer of the government to the hungry citizen , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ cakes @-@ attitude .
while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa farm cuisine of his kitchen , he aff@@ i@@ est like the millions of millions of world from the world to which he has become .
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; said Co@@ e .
he ate in an almost g@@ ild@@ ed dining room and carried a smo@@ king .
he was delightful and foreign .
President Roos@@ evelt might have committed the same mistake if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or asked him to stat@@ ure his stomach with his stomach .
as described in the book , the recru@@ iting of a house@@ ke@@ eper with no interest in flavors by Mrs Roos@@ evelt led that the White House brought forth the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most ex@@ on@@ est possible . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression , deal with food , has been rejected as soon as the land came back to the legs .
the legacy lies on our continued focus on calories and food , said Zi@@ egel@@ man , as well as on how science was applied to foods .
the couple gave to the writing of the book to have understood the eating habits of Zi@@ egel@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law - for example how they could not throw foods away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had a real fear of the wast@@ ing of food , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man reminded me : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she really made people sick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the wind @-@ bag .
after the plates were vac@@ ated at Eisen@@ berg &apos;s , they moved and Co@@ e a dessert that they had prepared home : the pl@@ ums , the President Roos@@ evelt took lunch .
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man and added that it was a nasty trick , humble recipes .
there was no p@@ add@@ ling cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and c@@ innamon .
everyone is something rel@@ u@@ ct@@ antly a spo@@ on into the tough , brown gli@@ b@@ ber .
amazing , it does not tasted bad .
Co@@ e took three times a draw@@ back .

he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : K@@ hal@@ ed O@@ mar dedicated his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ed everything to save others life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old @-@ old has died in a single @-@ bom@@ b attack by the Assad regime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
O@@ mar was a member of the &quot; White Hel@@ mets , &quot; a civil protection group , which saved according to the image @-@ newspaper almost 6@@ 0.000 people so far .
2@@ 900 volunteers put their own life into play to draw people from bom@@ bed houses and to make first aid in the war area .
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the face of the group : a video of the civil prot@@ ector , which shows him at a 11 @-@ hour rescue of a cleansing from the ruins of a house , went in 2014 around the world .
it made the Syri@@ ans to the shining symbolic figure in the gr@@ it@@ ch of the war .
but as heroes he has never seen himself , said according to the picture : &quot; for me this is the real Ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I am dying to save lives I think that God sees a mart@@ yr in me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before O@@ mar himself fell victim to a victim , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ bing ra@@ ids in Syria .

Greenland : the oldest whir@@ l@@ tier is nearly 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland usually come only in winter to finish .
this shar@@ k was allowed to get an examination on board the ship S@@ anna into the sea .
it was born in 16@@ 24 and swi@@ ms with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to the present day .
Green@@ land@@ ha@@ ie has only been grown up with 150 years of offspring .
frigh@@ tened the Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ hai along the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour it comes to an average of just 1.@@ 220 feet .
only when it arrives , the five meters long animal speeds on sat@@ te 2,@@ 6 km / h - and this speed is half as fast as a seal .
this of long @-@ lasting lifestyle seems to be a pan@@ ac@@ ea for a high age .
Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal Science &quot; at least of a Greenland who could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; mad@@ ness , &quot; commented Alexander Sch@@ eu@@ experience at the Max @-@ Planck @-@ Institute for demo@@ graphic research in Rostock this life span that means for verteb@@ rates a world record .
ad@@ mitt@@ edly , the evolution of evolution already suspected that Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie will be st@@ ony .
only did the evidence .
Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie are hard to observe , eventually they live mainly in the ice @-@ sea front of the thin@@ ked coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and Spit@@ s@@ bergen .
because they prefer water temperature around the six degrees Celsius , they appear on the surface usually only in winter .
about the lifestyle of Greenland , researchers know very little .
your time @-@ lu@@ pent@@ ag@@ o measures it , as they run from Spit@@ s@@ bergen six animals with a transmitter .
loo@@ t make these shar@@ ks nevertheless : in the stomach of a beast , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had the j@@ aw@@ bone of a young ice @-@ bear .
possibly they chase sle@@ ep@@ y animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of ice cream and are searching for car@@ c@@ asses , which tor@@ ney from higher water layers to the bottom of tor@@ ps .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues therefore studied 28 Greenland , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in Greenland or Spit@@ s@@ bergen as a result of the depth of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cen@@ timet@@ res long , while the largest 5@@ 02 cen@@ timeter measured .
to determine the age of the animals , analy@@ zes them with the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ method the lin@@ sen@@ ator of shar@@ ks .
this centre of intra@@ oc@@ ular occurs before the birth of shar@@ ks , which the proteins contained in it will no longer be renewed .
the two smallest shar@@ ks had stri@@ k@@ ingly high carbon @-@ 14 in the l@@ ender .
therefore your birth should therefore be in the atmosphere after the early 1960s as nuclear weapons testing a large amounts of this radio@@ active carbon into the atmosphere .

all major atro@@ cities in their lens , on the other hand , are normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts , caused by cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ clock showed an age of 3@@ 35 years ago , while the record shar@@ k is likely to be 3@@ 92 years old while the record shar@@ k is likely to be 3@@ 92 years old .
that Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ hai female will only get offspring if they are more than four metres , was well @-@ known .
now , the researchers were able to assign the length of an age .
as one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimeters are probably at the threshold of the sexually mature and his age with 156 years was determined , Greenland with the multip@@ lication is obviously at least one and a half centuries .
also this is likely to be world @-@ record for fluid @-@ animals .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence .
also the previous record card , a 211 years old Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ wal , in whose bac@@ on at the neck was cut a 120 year old Har@@ po@@ en@@ tip , was caught in front of Alaska .
due to the low temperatures often the animals of the animals living there are on spar@@ se .
so they mature - and al@@ tern slower .
in order to keep in hot water in cold water , the animals are also often particularly large .
because the volume grows much faster than its surface , which includes the animal heat .
the heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much bigger than with an gram elephant .
another advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; a small animal lives therefore dangerous and should concentrate on getting as many offspring as early as possible , &quot; explains the evolution of evolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a very large animal should invest some resources more likely to invest in a long life . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ xit
the city on the Main has resulted in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg to attract the best opportunities , from London to reloc@@ ated jobs and companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from Bre@@ xit &apos;s vote &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ lands , head of the Competence Markets and Real Estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Bre@@ xit referendum , it is uncertain whether to run money from London from financial transactions across the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is up to date for the so @-@ called EU @-@ Pass to date for approval in Great Britain .
this is currently using large US banks .
multiple banks have already announced to shift jobs .
the lob@@ b@@ ying certificate &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; will be counting on 10000 new jobs on the Main B@@ uns for five years .
for Frankfurt , so the I@@ W , the headquarters of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , is uni@@ fies responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro area , as well as further important authorities such as the European insurance , EI@@ O@@ PA and the risk of ES@@ R@@ B .
in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the staff is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ ans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luxembourg is home to a major fund industry , but also equally like Dublin as the infrastructure is worse .
Frankfurt is clearly easier to reach thanks to the great airport .
furthermore , the city with easily available commercial properties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ lands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the Seine , the renting for first @-@ class commercial properties at 50 percent are higher than in the Main .
in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime .
in a ranking of corporate consultancy Merc@@ er , the city stands on square seven , Luxembourg on square 19 , Dublin in place 33 and Paris at 3@@ 7th point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even though quality of life is a question of preference , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a financial location for the European single market , Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; hon@@ ours the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but London will continue to remain the most important financial centre in Europe despite Bre@@ xit .
to do this , also the power relations : in London worked according to figures from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba end of 2015 around 14@@ 4,000 people in the banking sector , in Frankfurt it was 6@@ 2500 .

clinics earn 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % Federal control
Hill@@ ary Clinton published its tax return for 2015 , which revealed for the presidential election of Democrats and her husband : a income of USD 10,@@ 75 million and an effective Federal tax exemp@@ tion of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , the Clin@@ tons of USD 1 million ended for charitable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; the former president Bill Clinton had an income of USD 3 million from Verlag Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for their book on their term in the State Department .
Clin@@ ics candidate for the Vice @-@ Presidents , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton his tax statements of the last ten years .
they paid an effective Federal tax exemp@@ tion of 20,@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; which Clin@@ tons Kamp@@ agn@@ en@@ hero@@ in Jennifer Pal@@ mi@@ eri was known in an opinion .
in a stark contrast , Donald Tru@@ mp is hiding behind false interpre@@ tations and re@@ trac@@ tions with regard to his previous promises to publish their tax statements .
it is common for US presidential data to publish their tax statements , even though they are not obliged to do so .
Tru@@ mp , a New York business@@ man , and lawyers have stated as reason for his ref@@ usal a tax check by the tax authorities .
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; Clin@@ tons of electoral campa@@ ign@@ ing in Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , in relation to the publication of the presidential did@@ act of Democrats .
on Thursday , Michael C@@ oh@@ en , Tru@@ mp@@ s special advis@@ ors , to CN@@ N , that he would not allow Tru@@ mp to release something before the tax testing has not been completed .
Tru@@ mp@@ s critics , among other things also the Republi@@ can presidential did@@ did@@ acy of the year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already vo@@ iced that his ref@@ usal issues relating to assets , his donations for charitable organisations , his business@@ man and different other compounds , especially with Russia .
Clinton has already over@@ thrown on the issue and published on Friday a video on the Internet in which high @-@ ranking Re@@ public@@ ans Tru@@ mp are calling for its tax return .
on Thursday she spoke the topic also during a speech about the economy of Michigan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he refused to do what any other presidential did@@ did@@ acy has done in the last decades and to publish its tax statements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Poli@@ tico has reported that Tru@@ mp has not paid any or only very little taxes during the 1990s , and a Economic journalist of the New York Times cited on Friday a number of tax attor@@ neys and tax consultants who may still be the case .
Bundes@@ wehr have become an issue in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a provision that is named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and Investor War@@ ren buff@@ ets which would make sure people earn more than USD 1 million a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during a voting event for Hill@@ ary Clinton in the past week in Omaha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called Buff@@ quet , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate here has its seat , tru@@ mp to a meeting in order to exchange their tax statements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Buff@@ ett said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has under@@ gone through a tax examination of IR@@ S and Tru@@ mp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before voters and not before tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ ker &apos;s campaign launched tax return to date back to 2007 .
the Clin@@ ics which now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid an effective Federal tax exemp@@ tion from about 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax exemp@@ tion of about 4@@ 0.5 % .
the actu@@ ators of the Clin@@ ics by 2015 showed that this only USD 100 of its income compared to revenue compared to the majority of all Americans .

the method has proved to be effective and the Honey@@ guide Foundation , which had previously experienced the idea along with the U.S. nature conservation , having trained volunteers in villages in the north of Tanzania , a non@@ violent quad@@ rup@@ ed method to protect their homes and harvest without destroying animals .
previously , many spec@@ ere have used to defend itself .
Friday is a telephone call which is dedicated to animal protection .
&quot; since we have developed this ...

the first two steps include the illumin@@ ants of the elephant with a tor@@ ch and the bub@@ bles in one horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not sc@@ aled , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chi@@ li@@ clouds &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Claude Lan@@ z@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; left its anger in the Kemp@@ inski Hotel in Berlin by wrote an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay Lan@@ z@@ mann tried to find Israel on the coun@@ sel@@ ector list of the hotel .
however , the country has not been listed among the countries which can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room .
how is it in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel has been eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lan@@ z@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol offers an opportunity to choose Israel via its own call center .
after an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception .
the answer he received there , &quot; beautiful it , &quot; as Lan@@ z@@ mann wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel employees said that the measure was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obvious choice of management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind it was extingu@@ ishing in the director even more anger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election is deleted , &quot; the An@@ z@@ mann received &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was cited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Israeli ambass@@ ador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ die @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; great shame , &quot; reports the South German newspaper .
we were horri@@ fied and upset for this event .
it really is very sh@@ ame@@ ful .
the fact that this in Germany has worn in exactly this hotel chain , is even more dis@@ gr@@ ace@@ ful shame .
this requires no explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right conclusions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the ministers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident sol@@ dering a fairly large resonance on the internet where the people called the whole sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some subordin@@ ate to the Kemp@@ inski Hotel , that there would be the alleged &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arab guests &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ashamed of you &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it was noted in another post , in which the hotel is located at the class@@ y Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , near a Synago@@ gue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly pointed all alleg@@ ations of himself and called the incident a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; ap@@ olog@@ ised &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Lan@@ z@@ mann , reports The mirror . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct statement , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Israel did not enter into the quick@@ set list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cited the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung a spokes@@ man of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;

trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
according to the lifting of the sanctions , according to the Russian ambass@@ ador in Iran , Lev@@ in D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the Chamber of Commerce between Moscow and Teheran in the annual comparison were 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent .
since the international sanctions against Iran , the interest in Russian companies grew strongly in businesses in the country , shared the ambass@@ adors .
Russian companies have existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , further trade expansion is one of the biggest priorities for bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that trading division between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent in comparison with the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , the Russian imports in Iran rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent br@@ ushing and ru@@ ined $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
the commercial recovery has been reached by deliveries of machinery , land vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the ambass@@ adors .
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan goes off for this year by a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
last year Russian international representatives gave some 3@@ 5.000 Vis@@ as , primarily from Reis@@ ev@@ is@@ as , an Iranian citizen .
moreover , Iran reached the top 20 countries that affects the number of tourists in Russia .
one could say that the record @-@ time tourists in Russia will be broken down from the last year , &quot; he said .
at the same time , only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something from which the Ambassador hopes that it will change .
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting towns Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d we have received the monuments of the old Persian civilization in a good condition . &quot; he said .

the mini@@ stran@@ ts from the past@@ oral care unit E@@ y@@ acht@@ al @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were traveling on a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vill@@ ingen to Freiburg .
together four stages were accomplished .
in order to bridge the time up to the next Roman@@ tic tour of all Mini@@ ts in the next two years , the Ober@@ minist@@ erial round St. Anna is to prepare for the preparation and implementation of a multi @-@ day pilgrimage .
various Wall@@ papers was tested and we decided finally for the Bishop of Freiburg , where during this year the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy with the opening ceremony of the mercy on the Frei@@ burg Münster was offered a special pilgrimage destination .
16 Min@@ is from Bitt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , Gru@@ ol , Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch and Heiligen@@ zimmern rose on the way .
in the evening before , pastor Stor@@ ost the pilgrims in a small celebration at St. Anna , blessed the pilgrimage and divided the pilgrimage .
from Hor@@ b there was driven by train at the start point Vill@@ ingen , where also a Münster , beloved wife is standing and so the pilgri@@ m away from Münster .
the single day tours were framed in the morning and in the evening depending on a short impulse with various prayers , songs and texts .
but also on the road , the Min@@ is to Feld@@ sect , chap@@ els or churches are repeatedly called R@@ ast to sing a song from the pilgrims of pilgrims .
for the nights we were always at disposal of the local par@@ ishes .
at the Et@@ app@@ endi@@ x Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller for a tasty , as well as the local dinner and breakfast .
it continued on the second day via Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
tags at that one entered the stage to St. Peter , which was the exhau@@ sting trail , but had to desc@@ ended at pregnant heat at first around 500 metres in the heat , and then again be heard .
the earned reward was in the evening a common gri@@ lling on the bathroom .
after the morning of the dawn on the fourth pilgrimage of St. Peter there went to the final stage to Freiburg .
visi@@ bly facilitated and happily met the Min@@ is at the later afternoon at the Frei@@ burg Münster , and crossed the gate of Mer@@ cy .

Sch@@ otte Call@@ um Sk@@ inner doors at home as Br@@ ite gold for cycling .
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner @-@ fastest last evening in the male @-@ team Sprint in Rio for fame , as the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow assumed the role of his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y . the young woman made himself too proud , when he stor@@ med to home a victory from favorites New Zealand .
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory for four years ago while Ho@@ y took the fifth of six Olympi@@ ad medals .
they repeated the trick , after they took place in March at the railways Championships in London despite the return of Ho@@ ys , just a modest sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in good time as a result .
Ho@@ ys retirement generated a gap that Ki@@ an Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ ampton are trying to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man where they stayed when they saw the potential in the car@@ rots that un@@ folds now .
Hin@@ der , Kenn@@ y - which started four years ago with Ho@@ y and Sk@@ inner in the qualification round a Olympi@@ ad record , but in the standing @-@ round si@@ eves the New Zeal@@ ands in the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
then after his lap was almost back but Kenn@@ y brought the team to the front and Sk@@ inner took it .
a strategy change made a large part of the transformation from where it was in a higher course to slow it down and to allow Kenn@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y saw from his position as a BBC expert and fell Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der , when they went on the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am just here to do my best and make a name for me .
we have conquered a Olympi@@ ad of the Olympi@@ ad and defeated the world champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph of 2012 at the side of Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys there was evidence that after a weak start he fell off at the track .
he returned this statement later and there was no objection of England Riv@@ als .
with such a super@@ l@@ orious victory this time was not such a problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels with the whole GB flags on the ble@@ ach@@ ers like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together as a team in the last three months .
we are so badly cast with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympi@@ ad .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , the seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London were won .
if this is a bar@@ ometer for our progress over the last five months , we expect a successful five days at the bicycle @-@ market .
with the form of characteristic , it is in the realm of possible that he repeated Ho@@ ys victory of three olymp@@ ic gold medals in a competition .
that would be born for Kenn@@ y - the exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was born on March 23 ( a apparently sacred date for British sports ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster was born ) - a explo@@ iting of six gold medals and a silver medal .
the cheese that of Ho@@ y is the same .
Kenn@@ y takes next in the spr@@ int that starts today and will go over three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I enjoy this just for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels somewhat lonely , alone to win .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he wins two more gold medals , he should be be@@ aten to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only med@@ alli@@ sts of the day , but there were further good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly Wig@@ gri@@ dge , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified himself with the fastest performance in the Vi@@ erer @-@ four o@@ dom@@ eter race .
they came in 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 9@@ 42 at the destination .
the World Record , which won in London in 2012 was at 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition , at the Wig@@ gri@@ dge , with certainty .
he had taken himself yesterday with the pres@@ idents in front of the qualification , when function@@ aries to themselves to measure his body size .
as opposed to the women &apos;s competition , the tomorrow continues and ended , Jo@@ anna Row@@ t , Jo@@ anna Riv@@ sell S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie Archi@@ soon of Mil@@ n@@ gav@@ ie in World War period in 4 : 13.@@ 260 .
the GB team rel@@ ies on its strong train wheel team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to pick a t@@ ar on medals .
after a truly exceptional presentation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London were driving the expectations for Rio .
it also played drama in the background so the res@@ ign@@ ation of the technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April in the midst of sex@@ ism and bullying , as well as the retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria P@@ end@@ let@@ on .
however , when one sees the first evening of competition in the Vel@@ o@@ rom , it looks quite later than it could be the legendary call GB@@ s that reached its peak at the perfect moment .
future of the mel@@ ting of Port@@ land due to the lifting of the energy order
the future of the aluminium mel@@ ts of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ stations of workers - are standing on the game since the plant operators will cancel the energy supply contract and thus lift all delivery agreements , as the supplier &apos;s suppliers .
this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria early this year , no further subsidies to be assigned to the operation of the plant .
a sub @-@ payout for 20 years is scheduled for November .
up to 2000 jobs in the complex of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land are at stake .
no less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be je@@ op@@ ardis@@ ed during a closure .
in addition , it could come to domin@@ o@@ effects as the mel@@ ting around 10 percent of the total power generation Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as consum@@ es .
in 2014 Al@@ coa closed the Point Henry mel@@ ei , which led last year to a closure of the fro@@ es@@ ea power station .
the mel@@ ting of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risky a closure .
this step follows the long term of spec@@ ulation regarding the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and finally due to the electricity value for the plant .
AG@@ L , which supplied the big aluminum mel@@ ting with his Lo@@ y Yang A Kraft@@ werk in Lat@@ robe Valley distributed , that it eman@@ ates that three other owners are announ@@ cing its contracts .
the complex is in a holistic property of a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which Chinese company CI@@ TIC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Corp will hold smaller shares .
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the system will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity through the mel@@ ting means , divided the company with .
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L also said that the Treaties were so called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; backup business@@ s &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which would have to take effect from November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contracts have a 12 @-@ month notice period , so that they will end 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so AG@@ L assumes that contracts will contribute to revenues in the financial year 17 to revenue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the current supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impact on revenues on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong termin@@ ology for wholesale prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L shared with that it has already written the value of the signed contracts in the annual amount of $ 187 million in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anticip@@ ation of a cancellation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ability Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the mel@@ ting or supply the power supply to the mel@@ ting &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U.S. company said that in 2010 reached a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , which should have entered into effect from November this year , even though it is still a statement found guilty of why it came back to the contract .
an@@ alysts war@@ ns due to the poor economic relations of the industry before the possible closure of the port of Port@@ land in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant in the vicinity of Newcastle .
in reference to the statements of the an@@ alysts at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen , that Port@@ land spent about 600 me@@ ga@@ watts and Tom@@ ago about 900 me@@ ga@@ watts of electricity .
should both systems disappear from the market , this would mean considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
and for us as a generator , it would not be good , &quot; he said .
more than just one car@@ c@@ hi@@ an Reality TV Star , Kendall is available in the cover of the sep@@ tic edition of the Vo@@ gue
Kendall Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and the fourth daughter of the manager and mother of Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner C@@ ans Kr@@ is is on the cover of the cov@@ eted Sept@@ em@@ ber@@ on of the US Vo@@ gue .
Kendall , the brand ambass@@ ador of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der and went on the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on their inst@@ ag@@ ram account .
&quot; in a room full of people I love , brought me the sight of this Co@@ vers to tears , &quot; I wrote .
the unveil@@ ing of the Co@@ vers followed a bizarre ( or simple Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an &apos;s family ( ) , forget the entire carbonate ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ nes as well as in the presence of the most popular show@@ bi@@ z On@@ k@@ els and producers of Ke@@ eping Up Ry@@ an Se@@ ac@@ rest ) as they end the cover of their sister and which ends with a classic twist : they all have a surprise party .
this presents the cl@@ ums@@ y plot almost every birthday to a children &apos;s invitation ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; you did that we would have forgotten you ? &quot; with the honesty of a cartoon by 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kr@@ is had to leave their other girls somehow to this publicity .
with regard to the cart@@ on of the Vo@@ gue has certainly started a new era in the Car@@ th@@ hi@@ ans .
that &apos;s great sister Kim likes it , as for the Vo@@ gue cover , sm@@ itten , they and her husband Kan@@ ye West were to be seen in April 2014 , but the cover of the journal edition of the magazine is a league for itself .
the sep@@ tum is available for Vo@@ gue the most popular issue of the year .
with a circum@@ ference that resembles rather an image band as a fashion magazine , the output extends a large number of advertis@@ ers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ist@@ a were from the 8@@ 32 pages of the rolling unit 6@@ 15 pages advertisement ) .
the unveil@@ ing of his Co@@ ver@@ stars is awa@@ ited so visually , that in the last two years pictures of the magazine has been reviewed yet before the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda Evangel@@ ist@@ a and K@@ ate Mos@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; celeb@@ rities , the mod@@ alities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mod@@ els &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; on the cover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar @-@ lau@@ re@@ ate and Di@@ or brand ambass@@ ador Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
but even at the low chance that Ms. Jen@@ ner - that is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of its generation - under the earlier category , it is in good company .
these celeb@@ rities are not related to famous people or reality stars or adolescents from today , who know how to turn a good Sn@@ ap@@ chat video ( even if it matches everything on Jen@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who stand in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once appeared on the last cover , had the release of L@@ emon@@ ades one of the most successful years of her career .
of course J@@ enn@@ ers don &apos;t like success any .
with her reality @-@ TV history J@@ enn@@ ers was always something tense in the fashion world .
in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret model Steph@@ anie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i H@@ adi@@ d and called her &quot; the Mi@@ st@@ ony of the Eye . &quot;
these feelings bo@@ iled again , when the message with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers came out on the Vo@@ gue cover .
but on the ab@@ ap@@ ness , it seems to pass on the point .
Kendall Jen@@ ner is available on the cover of the sep@@ tic edition of the Vo@@ gue .
it is in the tru@@ est sense of the word a Super@@ model .
it runs for Marc Jacobs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer from E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
you and all their sisters sell you pictures from themselves on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sold from her made pictures of C@@ ind@@ y Craw@@ for@@ ds daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her spare time she is on the reality TV to see . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
community @-@ centres in 16@@ 0.000 people each year
more than 160@@ ,000 of the aid @-@ con@@ fig@@ ure@@ most of the country are held annually by the municipal law centres , while the industry focuses on the effects of further mid @-@ term transactions on already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Queensland , three of five people are already elected three of five people - mostly older people , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means of un@@ just Del@@ o@@ gi@@ erungen , and those who have no means of legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services of the community , which are already over@@ loaded , are ready for further cuts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from June next year it is fores@@ een that these legal centres will lose some 30 percent of their funds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the director of the Municip@@ al centres of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last survey of the National Federation of Community centres yiel@@ ded that already thousands of people are refused every year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Far@@ rell said that the situation would be even worse without lifting the decision of the Federal Government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; que@@ lands of community centres are chron@@ ically supported , which means that thousands of people from important services that you need , be rejected , &quot; he said .
people who leave violent relations , people with uns@@ man@@ age@@ able and pressing debt , families who were released by separation , workers , the un@@ just @-@ wise were released - all these people have problems of a legal way and this survey shows that they cannot obtain the help they need .
the federal government will cut the funding by 30 percent from June 2017 , which means that thousands of needy people will be forced from Queensland to cope with their legal problems without any help .
we call on the gener@@ und@@ es@@ lawyer and judicial Minister as well as Sen@@ ators from Queensland George Bran@@ dis to stand up these mi@@ tig@@ ations , so people can get the help they need in legal problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year the national government met its commitments to raise funds for guidance on the national level . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is now time to look at the needs of the municipal centres and their customer communities , as well as the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k inv@@ ests in this important work .
Donald Tru@@ mp &apos;s campaign was indi@@ cted after employee attracted a weapon
new York : Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s campaign was charged because of alleged in@@ action after you have been told that her campaign manager for North Carolina have directed a stake for North Carolina in February while in February in a je@@ ep .
the incident described in an indictment described on Wednesday in the National Court of Charlotte through Vincent Bord@@ ini , a former software programming for the campaign in this state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bord@@ ini predicted that the matter would be governed internally before he realized that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the campaign manager , Earl Philip , &quot; moved a pist@@ ol , placed his right po@@ tions on the de@@ duction , and r@@ amm@@ te the run into Vinc@@ ents Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; gave Bord@@ ini in his indictment .
after having placed himself in the local and regional campaign , on @-@ board , Bord@@ ini stated that already at least four other people had the same experience with Phillip , he gave in the indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons must not be det@@ ained to establish damage , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave Bord@@ ini . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the accus@@ ation occurs only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential election was a tur@@ mo@@ il when he had a crowd in North Carolina said that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment &quot; People &quot; - Sch@@ uss@@ ar@@ cher owner and ceas@@ e@@ worthy - action should take action in case his ri@@ val@@ in Hill@@ ary Clinton should be elected and judge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp@@ s campaign clearly stated that the media would have heard its words in the context and that he would not increase violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey before Länder : SPD and CD@@ U are losing
in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) , significant losses for the Government Party and CD@@ U are characterised by the government .
this takes representative surveys of the Inter@@ disciplinary Research Institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; Image &quot; -@@ Newspaper ( Friday ) .
while the red @-@ black Government sco@@ oter could continue in the north just below , this is not possible according to the revenues in Berlin .
in both federal states , the SPD would be the strongest party and therefore would have good opportunities to continue the government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD cut from 3@@ 5.2 per cent to 24 percent a five years ago .
the party therefore pol@@ led to a survey just under the CD@@ U which could come back to 23 percent .
the third place is controversial between the left and the Af@@ D .
the left margin on 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 per cent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the country .
the Gre@@ ens hes@@ it@@ ated despite slight losses with 6 percent ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) in the Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not represented by 3 per cent in the day of the country .
at the Berlin Sec@@ tor selection , the SPD conducted the survey conducted only to 23 percent ( election 2011 : 2@@ 8,@@ 3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U only reached 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
they are thus still behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) but before the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 per cent ) .
the Af@@ D would be represented by 14 per cent for the first time in the or@@ derly house .
with 5 percent the F@@ DP could hope to return , the pirates would miss the withdrawal in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in Tim@@ lu@@ pe : 20 years ago , the Nokia Communic@@ ator came to the market .
the successor today dominate the world today - his manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the device weigh@@ ed almost a half kilo@@ gram and was more than four times as hard as an iPhone 5 .
it was thicker and bigger , it was therefore not good in the hand .
on the contrary , it was rather kno@@ cked .
the built @-@ in memory was initially eight me@@ gab@@ ytes , that would suff@@ ice for about two of its people with high resolution .
an iPhone is now shipped with at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ yte .
the &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; came exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , into the business - and it was the first smartphone .
for a few Euro fans can buy the devices still on the internet , but they are somehow from the Stone Age of the intern@@ age .
20 years ago , the Communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at CeBIT CeBIT in Hannover as an &quot; office in the West Bank format . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent for then standards a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails were sent and received , also by fax was the Communic@@ ator .
even the access to web pages was possible via HTML @-@ browser , al@@ beit slowly .
a calculator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be folded similar to a laptop .
then we found a small keyboard and a black @-@ white screen .
the price was quite proud of the price : 2@@ 700 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 Euro .
the average sales prize of a smartphone in Germany was at 3@@ 92 euros .
nobody was able to guess in August 1996 that the Communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
the smart phones are a success story , if not for Nokia .
the fin@@ s of fin@@ s survived an unprecedented Des@@ aster , was finally sold and handled in Microsoft .
the market master the market today that came all a lot later than Nokia .
ever and everywhere you will be online today for very many people today .
in 2015 there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide .
sold about 1.4 billion devices , by Samsung and Apple , alone 5@@ 55 million copies .
global sales with the equipment is around 400 billion euros .
to this end , the well @-@ running trading of the countless app providers and the telecommunications traffic can come .
around the smartphone there has been a whole industry in the meantime .
the decisive breakthrough on the mass market was only at the beginning of 2007 , then Apple leader Steve Jobs on the Mac world announced the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones .
he promised three instruments in one : a music player , a telephone and an Internet @-@ communic@@ ator , easy to use all via touch screen .
the ascent from Apple began , still today the iPhone is the most important product of the group .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market , had to see .
they finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the sag@@ as now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course for 20 years after his invention .
the cut looks at each German today 88 times a day on his cell phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must all learn to put away the smartphone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ms Jan@@ ina ball , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Siemens Management Board for Human Resources . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent ground@@ ability is now regarded as a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must draw the Olympic spirit and extend pi@@ a@@ throw
He@@ a@@ throw is not only used in our local municipalities or in all of London , but throughout the country of renewal and prosperity .
for me that was the biggest attraction of He@@ a@@ thro@@ ws , just as it was in 2012 in London , when we run a great deal of effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benef@@ ited from the games .
the Olympi@@ ad brought great advantages for Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and they will achieve again by creating new opportunities for or@@ ts@@ ky and companies close to He@@ a@@ throw new possibilities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for our local communities we will already have 10,000 new apprentic@@ es@@ hips to create new jobs and prepare youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just as they were ahead in London 2012 , there will be such that the challenge of enlargement He@@ a@@ thro@@ ws is too great .
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be bl@@ amed on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters had w@@ ron@@ gly bl@@ amed and they are also wrong at He@@ a@@ throw .
there are always obstacles to disappear , but He@@ a@@ throw answers any question .
how the Olympic Games is He@@ a@@ throw for many and not for individual structural project .
enlargement is a way to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion in swe@@ ating growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment both to the airport and in the whole GB .
we have been a great team in He@@ a@@ throw , which has implemented a £ 11 billion infrastructure investment in time and budget , from T@@ 5 - the five years as a result of the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to T@@ 2 , which was built in the middle of the two frequencies of the world .
now they are ready to provide a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion to private investment .
the London games of 2012 were a great success for UK and I am confident that the enlargement of He@@ a@@ throw is also one .
it is time to ste@@ er this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ a@@ throw and create a legacy trade and create a legacy of skills and jobs , which can be proud of England .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; K@@ atz and Maus@@ er &quot; with regard to advertis@@ ment
for companies that earn money online are according to one of the software producer attempts , re@@ direc@@ ting the ad block , a &quot; lower and mouse game . &quot;
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block re@@ viewing on his desktop page , published Ad@@ block Plus a blo@@ g@@ mail in which it hur@@ ts that users could hold their filters in the program to block again advertisements in the social network .
on Tuesday shared Facebook with that his desktop page would change the co@@ ding on his advertisements , in order to detect it re@@ viewing the detection that is part of the site advertising to detect .
but , Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to deal with the new codes .
in a Blo@@ g@@ post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams , that &quot; this species H@@ in @-@ and @-@ H@@ er @-@ battle is underway since the invention of display lock@@ ers in progress , and that Facebook is coming soon with a new solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that the world &apos;s largest company for social media has left into battle is a strong indicator of how worrying advertis@@ ers have become for the industry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a study conducted by the last year of Pa@@ ti@@ air and Adobe about 200 million people in the view @-@ lock@@ ers ; almost four times as much 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion daily active users , which access on Facebook via its mobile devices makes g@@ y@@ wer@@ 3.@@ 84 percent of the advertis@@ ers fac@@ ebooks from .
the company has created it on display block lock on desktop PCs because mobile display controllers does not have an effect on fac@@ ebooks mobile app for social network and inst@@ ag@@ ram distributed a speaker .
advertising on Desktop PCs makes a sufficient large proportion of revenue , so Facebook appears to be the investment of such a step as a worthwhile .
on Tuesday shared Facebook with that it would be &quot; ad @-@ pre@@ fix &quot; to update the people more control over it .
on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ jun@@ k would be worrying new filters because they would also block content on the side which are not advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the users this does not represent a positive experience , we plan to address the problem , &quot; shared a spokes@@ man of Facebook in an e @-@ mail communication . &quot; &quot; &quot;
displays are a bl@@ unt means why we instead have concentrated on developing tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences , to put more control into the hands of people .
woman with suspected self @-@ murder on Swiss auto@@ bahn
the victim was in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police call witnesses to go after a woman in the early hours of the morning on Thursday at a suspected self @-@ murder of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d just after midnight .
a woman laid down in the dark &quot; in an act of despair &quot; on the road and were taken by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d .
it is obvious that a Swiss is at the age of 49 , which was run by several vehicles , including a truck , ru@@ ined to kill themselves .
she died still on the spot .
several drivers have already been heard , but some are still not identified , the police , who needs these as well as any witnesses of the incident to sign up .
it was an investig@@ ative proceedings , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , Gill@@ es Hof@@ st@@ etter , Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gene@@ ve with .
however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown .
was a clash avoidable ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something that the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers are not going to be held accountable .
in each of the two cases - when a person went on the highway on the highway - was decided that the mot@@ orists not assume that a pedestrian walk in the middle of the night runs on the highway as it was in the newspaper .
last year a polic@@ eman of the gross@@ est kill@@ ings released after having over@@ ride a man and killed , who stood in August 2014 of a night on the A1 near Pay@@ erne .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victims had drunk and has become unconscious on the street , took the court .
the court confirmed that the polic@@ eman had responded to a call , -- on a justified manner , and that the presence of a man on the road was a &quot; totally unusual and unfor@@ es@@ een situation , &quot; said the Ju@@ dge .
anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday near Morges , should register with the police on the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA Kli@@ m@@ amo@@ del : Venus was once inhabited
the Venus was according to the proj@@ ections of a new NASA Kli@@ m@@ amo@@ d@@ ells probably once habit@@ able .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms that resem@@ ble those of climate research .
the model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere once was imposed by similar conditions .
scientists have previously pointed out that the slow turn of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation points out that Venus could have a thin , very similar atmosphere and still turned slowly .
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably pointed more dry areas than the earth , but once had enough water and geographic vari@@ ability to accommodate life and protects life from dark .
the early Venus also benef@@ ited from a sun that was 30 percent Mat@@ ter .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS @-@ Modell@@ simulation expon@@ ents the slow rotation of Venus present its daily page of the Sun almost two months , &quot; explained G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release .
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds , which affects the surface of much of the sun war@@ ms .
the result are average temperatures , which are some degree cooler than the Earth today .
the model brought forth a history of Venus that resembles the evolution that was previously suspected by Plan@@ etary Research .
although it was once inhabited , Venus -- in the course of several billions years --@@ zu@@ bly heat and ultra @-@ violet light was suspended .
their oceans dar@@ ed and their water vap@@ or was burned down by the ul@@ tra@@ violet light .
as their hydro@@ gen un@@ ched , there remained only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus , which as we know it today .
the researchers share the results of their new Venus climate models in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .

Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as a trainer and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado and led to the team &apos;s right decision @-@ making process .
alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and notice that the association will immediately look for a new trainer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past three years I have met my duties as Chief Apostle and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of Colorado , passion and determination , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vo@@ iced the 50 @-@ year @-@ year Roy in an opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have long been thinking about how I could improve this team to give him more depth it needs and to bring it to a higher level .
to achieve this , the vision of the trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly matched to the organization .
it also has to have a right decision on making decisions that affect the performance of the team .
these conditions are not currently not fulfilled .
Sak@@ ic , who was cons@@ ulted by Roy on May 23 , 2013 , than@@ ked him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick has informed me today about this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we all appreciate what he did for our organisation and wish him the best for the future .
Roy was awarded the winner of the Jack Adams Awards during his debut season in 2013 @-@ 14 as the Best Trainer of the League .
he led the association to 112 points and first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was be@@ aten in the first round of the pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minnesota and missed the after@@ season in each of the last few years .
the Aval@@ an@@ ches featured in season 2015 @-@ 16 a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand and fell behind the Wild for a second game @-@ spot in the Western Conference around five points .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart Roy four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with the Montreal can@@ adian and the Aval@@ an@@ che .
standards workers back calls again to put strike from
the labour struggles for re@@ mun@@ er@@ ation for the North Sea re @-@ workers will be suspended , whereas all issues for a new round of talks are put at the table , they said negotiation leaders .
strike against the oil field service provider Wood Group were spor@@ adi@@ cally conducted on platforms in the North Sea , which are operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wood Group as well as the un@@ ites and r@@ uses trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to begin to restart the complicated process of current struggle , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in a common statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will hold some full @-@ day meetings in the next weeks to start the beginning of next year to tackle the problems again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the unions said that their last strike , who is the first in over 25 years , a protest against possible wage rates of up to 30 percent .
wood Group has shortened this year the rates on its contrasts in the North Sea by about 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the rating of the company follows a 10 @-@ percentage drop for on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts in the company gives the required space to get through the market down@@ turn .
Shell has released for its part thousands of people released and plans to give plans to present its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries as a result of its business activities as a result of his me@@ gat@@ ru@@ ction with the British energy company BG Group ration@@ alized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; energy companies are under pressure , a economic situation that had intensified due to the decision of the British in June , the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish Executive Board Dave Anderson met working leaders at the beginning of this week with workers &quot; leaders in order to discuss one of the biggest labour activities that have been conducted since a generation in the North Sea .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy which works for many and not only for a few , &quot; he said in a statement .
in 2016 , less than $ 1,4 billion will be expected for new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of about $ 7 billion in the past five years .
Ke@@ pler measures Rot@@ ary rate of stars in the star @-@ star of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with Ke@@ pler Space tel@@ esc@@ ope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates under the stars of the star gate of the Ple@@ j@@ ades .
the new data will help the astronom@@ ers to understand why stars in the star cluster to different rates and in which connection the rot@@ ational periods have been dealt with .
&quot; we hope that we experience the equ@@ ating of our results with other star , more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Luisa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the observ@@ atory of the Ple@@ j@@ adas is situated 4@@ 45 light@@ years from the earth .
many stars in this constellation that originated approximately 125 million years ago , now reaching adul@@ thood .
you are now turning at the fastest .
at peak rot@@ ational rates this po@@ ign@@ ant stars show large amounts of ast@@ er@@ winds .
since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a brake effect on the stars .
if a star is alter@@ t , its rot@@ ational rate starts to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rot@@ ational rate of each star by placing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star@@ ring -- like sun@@ spots .
the latest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates points out that mass@@ aging stars are slower than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with a dancer , with larger stars of slow Pi@@ rou@@ ettes to be smaller than smaller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ballet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Ple@@ j@@ adas we see that slow rot@@ ors will tend to be massive , while being faster rot@@ ors to be very bright stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the star @-@ str@@ aps of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; the star @-@ str@@ aps of the Ple@@ j@@ adas offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Re@@ ull .
there is still much ahead of us that we would like to learn more about how , W@@ ann and Why stars slow their rot@@ ational rates and say their &quot; dance gloves . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and their colleagues reported in three newspaper reports in detail about their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the Ple@@ j@@ adas , which will soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eball @-@ Star appears
the tears flies at Alex Rodri@@ guez faster than the US Bas@@ eball Star in best days from Base to base .
according to his emotional review date , the 41 years old professional begins on August 12 against the Tamp@@ a Bay R@@ ays a last time the jer@@ sey to its New York Yan@@ ke@@ es .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &apos; Goo@@ db@@ ye &apos; to both , stated the 14 @-@ time all @-@ star @-@ star @-@ participants of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) .
three times Rodri@@ guez was elected to the most valuable players of the League , in 2009 he won the Yan@@ ke@@ es World Series .
his signature under one of the year @-@ year deal has been occupied by 27 million US dollars annually since 2007 .
until the end of the Convention on 31 December 2017 , he will be in future as a consultant and youth coach - at full sal@@ ary .
as a player paying it Rodri@@ guez long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ us &quot; ) for the Seattle Nav@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es made some mil@@ estones .
with the Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame @-@ Members H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e M@@ ays assign only two more bas@@ eball players in the most important statistics similar values .
yet in the rest of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls the 41 @-@ year @-@ old may not be recorded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for as successful Rodri@@ guez - nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - was in the field , so controversial is his appearance beyond the place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; already in 2009 the super@@ star returned to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; between 2001 and 2003 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 it was closed due to a winding in so @-@ called bio@@ graphies @-@ sc@@ andal until the end of 2014 for 211 games .
Rodri@@ guez is regarded as main susp@@ icious , for years on an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida @-@ promoting resources .
after a dispute the lock was reduced to 162 encounters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the league could even have done a favor for the year 2014 , because I have played 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ guez then swe@@ at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even his f@@ arewell @-@ days did not go straight away .
while many bas@@ eball legends have got into their last games once again the big stage , Rodri@@ guez frequently had to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include a f@@ arewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job involves trying to win every game , &quot; ätz@@ te Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di .

Olympics 2016 : Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa and Adrian Tar@@ inski are first D@@ op@@ ing@@ cases
wi@@ pes : because of a positive D@@ op@@ ing@@ probe , wei@@ ch@@ the@@ ber Adrian Tar@@ inski from Poland did not start in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 are over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed by the first official D@@ op@@ ing@@ cases .
a du@@ sty ath@@ lete would have won nearly one medal .
in front of the seventh competition , the first official D@@ op@@ ing@@ cases became known as the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter obstacles in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa from Bulgaria and Polish wei@@ ch@@ the@@ v Adrian Tar@@ inski were positively tested and excluded in front of the beginning of the already cri@@ tically neglected athle@@ tics competition .
at Ch@@ en has been demonstrated the Di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ i@@ azi@@ de last Sunday , which is used as mas@@ onry resources for dop@@ amine sub@@ tract .
the International Sport@@ sman CA@@ S confirmed on Friday morning of the day to the exclusion of the Olympic Games .
on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old took the fourth place in the finals over 100 m Butter@@ fly , just around 0.@@ 09 seconds , they missed the bronze .
on Friday Ch@@ en would have to take part in the footh@@ ills of 50 m Fre@@ est@@ l .
Ch@@ en has requested the opening of the B sample at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association take the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very serious and demands of Ch@@ en &apos;s full cooperation with the investigations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cited X@@ in@@ hua from a Communication : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sport@@ sman CA@@ S and will accept the verdi@@ ct . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history is not the IO@@ C but the CA@@ S responsible for the refur@@ bish@@ ment of athletes and positive cases .
also during the night of Rio le@@ ak@@ ated the news about the positive sample at G@@ ek@@ ova , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went to the offensive .
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; this is &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; she said the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was inno@@ cent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the athle@@ tics level . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , it is expected to act on the forbidden substance for the blood @-@ offering AC@@ O .
Dan@@ ek@@ owa was provisional provisional , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample is supposed to have already been positive .
Bulg@@ arians Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ ov , immediately invited himself with criticism of the ath@@ lete .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why the ath@@ lete do not draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Bul@@ gar@@ en stand under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , for instance , all weights from the chron@@ ically dou@@ bling nation should not participate in Rio .
on Friday also the case &quot; Adrian Tar@@ inski &quot; became known , the London Olympics in Class up to 85 kg was tested positive on the an@@ abo@@ le Ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon .
both sto@@ cking the intake , however , both must not start in the class up to 94 kg .
before starting the athle@@ tics , the case of Dan@@ ek@@ owa is another serious blow to the reputation of the whole sport .
the World Association IA@@ AF had taken the complete Russian team up to an exception for systemic D@@ op@@ ings , even the L@@ aying Kenia in Rio produced a number of bad news .
in the swimming sport , the former champ@@ ions in China had taken care of fierce debates also between the athletes .
so the French@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t the Chinese Olympi@@ asi@@ an Sun Yang har@@ sch .
&quot; sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt purple . &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium over 200 m of Fre@@ est@@ l , I want to pass it , &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t on the French radio .
sun was also at the heart of an argument with the Austr@@ ali@@ er M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and respect for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intelligence &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was positive at the Chinese champion@@ ships positively to the stim@@ ul@@ ant Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but had to sit just a three @-@ month lock .
data c@@ ł@@ aw : so per@@ fi@@ de er@@ presses h@@ ackers their ran@@ som
programmers of Er@@ press@@ - Mal@@ ware currently take targeted companies - and are successful in this process .
according to a recent survey conducted by Mal@@ ware &apos;s specialists in Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes under 5@@ 40 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the surv@@ eyed companies have been at least once again in the past twelve months , partly several victims of a attack with re@@ pres@@ ser software .
in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies have already had the aim of a ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mailing .
40 percent of the victims paid by the offen@@ ders demanded to use the challenged systems and data again .
the offen@@ ders speci@@ alize their re@@ pres@@ ser software according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes to attack on attacks in corporate networks .
if they are successful there , the potential to re@@ pres@@ sive ran@@ som significantly higher than in private users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are currently watching a scary rapid evolution of harm software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes , Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2008 most mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs were still designed to send advertising .
then we discovered the perpetrators of press@@ oring software for itself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only abroad were the target , but the change to company att@@ acking occurred within the past few months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ran@@ som@@ ware works for a simple pattern : once on the computer of a sacrifice , it searches for un@@ long changed files such as Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files as well as archives of pictures and videos .
these files encryp@@ ts the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als .
then the software presents the demands of the presses .
in order to get the final deco@@ ding code to the files , the victims need to make money - mostly in the form of cryp@@ to@@ mal@@ nutrition .
however , where private users use the personal photo database at stake , it is about sensitive customer data or project databases without which the production is shut down .
accordingly higher the damage falls off when a ran@@ som@@ ware suggests .
22 percent of the affected German firms mel@@ ted sales loss by Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 per cent had even had to break the business operation completely , in one case people were in life @-@ danger .
in Germany , several hospitals were victims of attack , whose patients can be threatened by loss of sickness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say the victims always : pays not , you only promotes the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , 80 to 90 percent of companies pay , get their dates back .
for managers it is difficult to reject the demand of offen@@ ders in operation .
the h@@ ackers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , the security researchers of F @-@ secure the crops surfaces and the contact with the presses studied and come to the result : the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money .
you declare your cas@@ u@@ alties by chat , as they can pay by Bit@@ coin , establish free @-@ accessible support websites , or un@@ lock for example example files .
and will private merchants dis@@ solve payments of a few hundred Euros , companies have to pay partly tough and five @-@ digit sums in order to return their data in@@ secure .
given the potentially high and relatively risky profits from the ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mailing , the h@@ ackers are always professional and share the work , explains security expert Chester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from Anti@@ virus @-@ provider Sop@@ hos : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware about within one week . &quot;
more likely it is that it is about three or four people .
programmers sell their harm software then in the form of a software construction to the actual press .
the previous Mal@@ ware kits were created by the Mal@@ ware itself , advice and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; the package includes a adaptation tool , so that smaller configurations , appearance and bran@@ ding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
the presses are then looking for more h@@ ackers to spread the fresh purchased software under the cas@@ u@@ alties .
we live in a service industry .
so one logs in one of the forums in the underground , bu@@ ys the set of a criminal and commissioned another way to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
the payment is made per un@@ authorised computer .
&quot; usually , the crimin@@ als then over@@ s sp@@ ammer with the spread , &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
in the meantime , the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known for many companies that secure their data .
over 50 percent of companies @-@ IT @-@ makers in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey rely on it , Ran@@ som@@ ware to be v@@ ested with file @-@ back @-@ ups and sc@@ ann@@ er@@ software .
accordingly , the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the encryption of data alone is not sufficient threat to successful exhaus@@ tion , the perpetrators put forward with the release of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes of Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this makes damage potential , depending on the type of data still a multiple times higher than before .
in future , the perpetrators could be entirely new goals on the internet of things on the grain .
on the Hack@@ er@@ Conference Def@@ con demonstrating security researchers as they could get a thermo@@ stat on their control with the internet .
in the middle of winter , the activation of such a blocked heating could certainly be a ran@@ som .
if the perpetrators are then instead of heating into the future a whole production street in a factory , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a topic in industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and everyday @-@ proof
in the small HR @-@ V , Honda wants to pack everything : a little s@@ UV , a little cou@@ pe and also the versatility of a mini@@ v@@ ans .
sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was designed on the same new platform like the new jazz proves to be quite flexible in everyday life .
although the only 1,@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V rather small , passengers have plenty of space both in the front row and in the F@@ ond .
the materials of the interior are well finished and work comfortably , only the cock@@ pit @-@ upper side falls off .
versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V during storage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is not only a trunk of 4@@ 53 l on top @-@ up and 10@@ 26 l back @-@ out bac@@ kl@@ ed back , but there is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less magical , when it sounds : the seats of the back@@ bench can be polished like Kin@@ os@@ es@@ sel and offer storage space , which is high from the floor up to ceilings 1.@@ 24 metres .
the luggage space can be loaded well , however the lo@@ ader height with 650 mm is slightly higher than with the comparative Peugeot 2008 .
the engine tested 1,6 @-@ l @-@ diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp speeds the HR @-@ V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide range areas very powerful .
however , he is likely to judge his work somewhat more qui@@ eter .
encouraging is the everyday consumption of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km .
there is another motor@@ arization : a 1.5 @-@ l @-@ gasoline @-@ cylinder with 96 kW / 130 hp .
a wheel drive is not offered .
driving behaviour is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
but the steering is likely to be a little more direct .
the equipment can be opened in the tested top @-@ variant &quot; Executive &quot; no wishes .
among the safety systems belongs to the City @-@ Not@@ bra@@ king wizard ( works up to speed 32 ) , the col@@ l@@ isions @-@ system and the trace assistant .
the col@@ l@@ isions sometimes irrit@@ ates sometimes because it evalu@@ ates many obstacles in the ran@@ ge@@ aring of many obstacles as &quot; her@@ b@@ ying objects . &quot;
very reliable works by the tel@@ com assistant .
and the intelligent fi@@ dd@@ lers re@@ acts to the road detection and th@@ rot@@ ors in need the speed .
the full connectivity is available only for top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , Nav@@ i , App @-@ Integration and More .
two US@@ B@@ - and an HDMI socket are underneath the arm@@ rest and therefore are something aw@@ k@@ ward to achieve .
the approximately 30@@ 000 Euro for the well @-@ equipped top @-@ diesel are fine .
those who do not want to invest so much , get the gasoline starting from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel from 2@@ 3000 Euro .
the motors meet the Euro @-@ 6 exhau@@ st standard .
with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday driving car .
Airline is not liable : down@@ fall on passenger bridge
an Airline is not liable for the down@@ fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge .
because a liability is conceivable only by dangers that are typical of air traffic , argued the Higher Regional Court of Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had broken down with the fall of a knee br@@ ace .
however , the accident could have been happening all over - it is a general risk of life , so the court .
the airline had to pay no damage to the man .
disease cases : when paying the organizer
the vac@@ ation@@ ers get only money after their trip , if the cause of the illness is dou@@ bt@@ less free in the hotel .
however , this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests were proven to show the same symptoms .
in that case , a family was heavy on the second day of their tur@@ k@@ not@@ ary hard to diar@@ rho@@ ea and v@@ om@@ iting .
she spent almost the whole holiday in the room .
their disease led the vac@@ ation@@ ers to a def@@ ective Kl@@ ä@@ ran@@ ger that alle@@ ge@@ dly so@@ iled the se@@ a@@ water .
the family was the view , the journey was so faul@@ ty - and def@@ endant against the organis@@ er .
in court the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had no success .
though the se@@ wage system was in fact def@@ ective .
but the organizer was just before departure of the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff of it .
he had to assume that the sea water was fine .
he did not violate his information duties , so the judgment .
especially as in the samples of water no contam@@ in@@ ants have been found .
the illness of several hotel guests - wom@@ ens through infection between one another - belonging to the general risk of life .
of 6@@ 91 guests were only 38 dise@@ ased .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère said , after the powers used by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people would have concern about other attacks .
the state must be taken and determined at the same time respond to terror .
for sure , our country will not answer the perpetrators of hatred and separation .
we will not give the terrorists to this triumph .
if there would have had to rely on the country faster , but it also increases the safety and strength of the population for the refugee policy .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère wants to achieve a implementation of the proposals by the Bundestag in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced another personal strengthening of security forces , and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in medium @-@ sized order for several years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sympathy for terrorism must be under penalty .
video surveillance is to be improved , the weapon can be achieved so far , that mainly the purchase of weapons on the Internet is worthwhile .
the last much discussed silence for physicians should remain in accordance with de Mai@@ zi@@ ères words .
however , in dialogue with the poorest nations , he wants to search for solutions as the dangers of the citizens could be reduced , he said with regard to mental ch@@ ests .
to counter@@ act a radi@@ cal@@ isation of refugees , the minister keeps a better social care for necessary .
teachers would have to be better prepared for dealing with traum@@ atis@@ ed people .
the persecution of criminal crimes in special areas of the Internet ( Dar@@ k@@ net ) plans de Mai@@ zi@@ ère the use of co@@ vert investigations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD Chief Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to increasing security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that the internal Minister clearly spoke against action . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this was an ear@@ ring for the sni@@ per in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel said the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Medi@@ ation ( Friday ) .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had rejected Ru@@ fe from the Union to a Bur@@ ka ban and the abolition of double citizenship previously rejected .
a general prohibition of the enforcement shall be problematic for un@@ constitutional .
you cannot offer everything you re@@ jects , and I Leh@@ ne the wearing of the Bur@@ ka .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; talking about rules about road traffic or to witness against court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green boss in Simone Peter threw the Minister before , he wants to sim@@ ulate new anti @-@ terror packages and capacity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ wing line Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fleet sp@@ amm@@ ers and a shar@@ pen@@ ing of residence to the right bring people in this country no longer safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better transport in the motorway
it is regularly on the road @-@ road - here a picture of November .
but this should change : the rule of law is to be extended .
this is good news for all car drivers , who stand in traffic on the ambient road every night in the traffic jam , if you drive over the motorway from Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
the provincial road extends the next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between the hammer street and the descent Wes@@ eler road the right @-@ in track to 700 meters .
mot@@ orists can then direct directly from the Hammer street to the right .
the great advantage : the traffic also divi@@ des early on , thus improving the total process on the multi @-@ driven section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district of representation Münster @-@ West .
the driving force on the Zu@@ br@@ inger nervous the mot@@ orists above all between 17 and 19 AM .
on week@@ days the return day ranges from the rear to the bridge over the Alber@@ Sloven@@ her path and sometimes even beyond .
the needle is the needle on the B 51 shortly before the departure of Wes@@ tin Street .
from here the traffic is only sent to the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be trac@@ ed back several years ago .
the reason : static calculations have shown that the bridge no longer has the required effect , in order to take up especially the heavy duty @-@ traffic of bil@@ ing@@ ual .
how long this Eng@@ pass and the connected cl@@ utter will last , the responsible country can not say .
however , with years to reck@@ on , because the bridge has an official rest period up to 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the dispute of the dispute , the provincial company deliberately chosen the bu@@ g@@ able time in the school holidays because with disabilities is to be reck@@ oned .
the traffic will be guided on Tuesday and Wednesday in the construction site .

relaxing night : tips against sleeping disorders
in the evenings one is etern@@ ally around , at night you can awake even more hours in the morning , in the morning there is no more to think of sleep .
this is anything but relaxing .
after all , one has such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch @-@ Institute , about a quarter of adult sleeping disorders , and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently relaxing than not relaxing .
how can sleep problems or sleeping disorders ?
there are several forms of sleeping disorders , and there are many causes underlying them , empha@@ sizes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ iser , board member of the German Society for Sle@@ eping Research and Sle@@ eping .
what one understands it is , but the in@@ som@@ nie , therefore an entry and sle@@ ep@@ tive disorder .
especially that all often feel many people as uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , says Jens Bol@@ knecht , Board member of the German Haus@@ Medical Association with practice in Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Var@@ el .
what is behind sleeping disorders ?
the causes of sleeping disorders are complex .
behind it can organic , mental or behavi@@ oral factors , but also drugs are stuck .
not rarely is the dis@@ rup@@ ture expression of another disorder .
&quot; very early wake up is especially common during a depression , &quot; says We@@ er@@ .
and it may be that different factors are each other .
who , for example , has a belt pre@@ matur@@ ely , can be bad , guarded every two to three hours and starts bl@@ ur@@ ely , about everyday problems and -@@ worry , are We@@ ap@@ ed an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
from when should one be with sleeping disorders to the doctor ?
who over a period of one month in at least three nights per week does not sle@@ ep@@ y and on the day should be com@@ promised to go to the doctor .
the impair@@ ment can vary completely different : it is sm@@ itten , tired , un@@ exhausted , has difficulties with the attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mo@@ ods or physical discomfort such as stomach or head@@ aches .
in order to alle@@ vi@@ ate the sleep , it is important to find their causes .
as a treatment options , behavi@@ our@@ al changes occur , a cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or even medicines - classical dor@@ ms just in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ request .
low @-@ term sleep medical medi@@ cs are available in Germany , empha@@ sizes Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary medical center of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin .
therefore one should contact the doctor first in sleeping troubles .
he can clarify with examinations whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to the sleeping laboratory , and what happens there ?
for investig@@ ating in the sleeping laboratory , he is intended for example with snor@@ ing with respiratory diseases , at bed@@ time fatigue , or if one does not find the cause of a sle@@ ep@@ tive disorder , explained fi@@ etze .
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the investigation .
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; only please do not make a n@@ ap , &quot; says Fi@@ etze .
after em@@ bank@@ ment you go to bed at its normal time .
besides the electrodes on the body you can carry a no@@ zzles , a chest strap , and a ant@@ enn@@ ae on the finger .
it also features a camera on the ceiling to sleep .
how can people get the problem under control ?
there are quite a lot of positions that you can sleep for better sleep .
We@@ er@@ ania counts : regular sleeping @-@ time and elevator , not too long in bed , on the day do not sleep , do not watch TV to sleep , alcohol , and at night cannot look at the watch - then you start immediately to reck@@ on , and that &apos;s all and certainly not condu@@ ci@@ ve .
what the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming has to be
the former German float Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has expressed themselves by Facebook to dis@@ appoint the DS@@ V @-@ Team at the Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 he took gold at the Short World Championships for the first time in Doha and at the same time presented his first world record at the same time .
now the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ let Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has become more protected against his in criticism of the ex @-@ team members .
&quot; in a country where a olymp@@ ic winner receives 20,000 € rewards and a jungle @-@ kö@@ nig 150@@ ,000 € should not be talked about missing medals , &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old in the night to Friday on his fac@@ ebook page .
the conveyor system in swimming sport is bad , the D@@ op@@ ing@@ controls is very good .
with this we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not just see exactly what they do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not saying that the controls should be set here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said he continued . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , D@@ ei@@ bler had to be reported nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ Doping Agency in Germany ( NA@@ DA ) .
this is how you should keep it with countries .

airport : Ban@@ de Bag@@ di@@ eben arrested
professional Di@@ ebe at Düsseldorf Airport
the Düssel@@ dor@@ fer police succeeded on Thursday the arrest of two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 years .
the Tat@@ susp@@ ects had committed as Ban@@ de several pocket and baggage paraly@@ sis .
at 21.@@ 30 , civilian officials in the area of the Airport Düsseldorf became a banker back which was known to the polic@@ eman from the past th@@ theft .
the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences since the middle of July this year , and were largely professionally managed .
the specialists of the crimin@@ al@@ com@@ b@@ ari@@ ate 34 can warn the thi@@ eves for the exter@@ mination of criminal off@@ ences to Germany , four deeds .
they had a total of more than 15@@ ,000 Euros exploited .
Alt@@ constructions , a couple of Lin@@ den@@ ers , inter@@ woven by even a remainder : the Riga road in Berlin @-@ Fried@@ ri@@ chs@@ ha@@ in works at first sight not so , but the police are one of the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
one goes along the road from east to west , one is coming to playing places , a fresh@@ ing kinder@@ garten and a c@@ ol@@ ades .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the facade of a gray house someone has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ugly ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tested . &quot; &quot; &quot;
across from a Li@@ d@@ l , which is also soon demol@@ ished , will be built already : until 2017 there is a house with high windows and 133 new rentals .
article about this &quot; trendy neighborhood &quot; as the competent real estate company Fried@@ ri@@ chs@@ ha@@ in calls , however , are preferred in recent weeks with burning cars .
the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , now , the residents are occupied , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , H@@ enkel has been expressed several times for a tough action of the police against the project , the area as &quot; No @-@ Go @-@ Zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
after on 22nd June the rooms were vac@@ ated on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , with 300 police officers , had been pat@@ alled three weeks official statements , with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site , sper@@ med parts of the road and kept visitors to enter the house with the number 94 .
meanwhile , building workers on behalf of the in@@ famous home@@ owners the rooms .
on 13 July , a Berlin administration course decided that the clearance was illegal , and a day later , police and construction workers went down under the che@@ er of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents .
on this summer afternoon , the road works peaceful : parents are going to walk with children , people sitting on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others enter@@ tained .
in the immediate vicinity of the house projects there is a primary school and kinder@@ gartens .
left force is not the main character of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in the Kie@@ z since 1999 , and Jan@@ a * , which draws up three children here , are gener@@ alized from the police presence .
with the inhabitants of house@@ projects , they share the concern of rising cre@@ eks and v@@ entri@@ fication .
it does not sound after a pine forest , who wanted to bring about a majority of pol@@ ishing protection against v@@ and@@ ali@@ ent on the left .
the dit@@ ch , who of the Berlin @-@ sen@@ ator and the police between the household and their neighbours are apparently not exist .
Fried@@ ri@@ chs@@ ha@@ in in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional workers &quot; district , which today came to a lower average time compared to the rest of the city , and has a high degree of poverty .
household projects and the native living projects have already been part of the p@@ ines : in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , among which almost the entire main@@ zer street very close to the town of Riga .
while the Main@@ zer was evacu@@ ated under a big police battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the town of Riga and are still inhabited by people today who had occupied them 26 years ago .
at the same time , the district has become increasingly popular for the magnets for tourists and the elec@@ torate @-@ liner from all over the world : with them the inhabitants of the GDR @-@ Time and former home occupied their pine trees .
this also noticeable in the rental period , which has increased almost 60 per cent since 2009 .
many of the new@@ buildings in the town of Riga are attacked as symbols for this development : they recognize them con@@ ed sli@@ ces or freshly made fac@@ ades created with color @-@ exploited .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no other street was mentioned this year along with the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; linear violence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one reason why not all neighbours look at it as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes such as post@@ infringement are affecting statistics almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
the most part of the criminal off@@ ences make damage resulting from the re@@ builds of new buildings and newly renovated houses .
for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has worked for 17 years in a rental building next to the controversial 94 , there can be no talk of uncertainty .
as for violence , it is des@@ crip@@ tive ; the people in the 94 are their neighbours , which were certainly not .
also the famous burning cars had no longer exist in the town of Riga .
for the studied architect , her street is not a crime point , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has become aware of the Riga @-@ Straße and remained intact .
for this reason , it was also so important that the local residents got back their road : from the police , the politics and the media , which in July all suddenly claimed the interpretation of the district .
but in the eyes of inhabit@@ ant@@ as such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road will continue to be taken away : sigh@@ ted new@@ buildings in former buildings that impose the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are ultimately con@@ domini@@ um , which are not interesting for many of them - here are rather people who are not so well drunk , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence and destruction can I have absolutely no &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; healing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what should one do if someone is never listening to anyone ?
there is frustration on all sides , even with the police and the residents .
for adding more colours , Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the home@@ work projects and the left scene belonged to the p@@ ines .
who her@@ ed , should be aware of - just like anyone who runs in a pub , who can complain about noise there .
all persons provided with names have asked to be called by their correct name
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugees
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact for integration and organizer .
in addition , she is a social worker on the spot .
since July Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le the refugee commission@@ er for Ur@@ bach .
the Social Ped@@ gin supports the team of management by Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees itself as a contact person for all players : refugees , Arbeitsk@@ reis Refu@@ ge@@ ology , Administration , authorities and who else is still mis@@ led .
Reg@@ ine customer from the working circle indicates that the volunteers are more than thankful that Deu@@ el now is , the thri@@ ving Wol@@ l@@ mil@@ ch@@ sau , which primarily has an issue .
so some - less mo@@ cked than on the wide variety of you wish to pur@@ pos@@ e@@ ful - meant that the administration wanted to write the place .
searched for was an administrative force with a talent for languages and people , associated with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , just a thri@@ ving Wol@@ l@@ mil@@ ch@@ sau .
yet administrative work is not its central area , means Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
above all , it is about organisation , work with the people on the ground and also behind the scenes as well as network activity .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has a 50 @-@ percentage point on three years of extension .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le hon@@ ours and full @-@ time actors supported . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are large and minor problems , organizational , human and insur@@ g@@ ents .
soon there are new containers in the washing @-@ road
an enormous problem , it has been recognized for some time , apartments for connecting @-@ refugees who have been acknowledged .
the municipalities are responsible for the connection .
you must place the refugees in your own or rented sitting rooms .
the cost of the construction , the rent or restoration of these accommodations must carry out the municipalities themselves .
the responsibility changes from the Land@@ scape with the commune and job center .
problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer its apartment .
the search has been designed for some time as very difficult .
de facto the administration finds no private apartments .
so far it is not working so far , it is possible to rely on private apartments , so deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , gener@@ alized apartments need to be missed as it is so beautiful .
so soon new containers are placed in the washing @-@ road .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the key@@ word , are Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agreed .
in addition to a firm B@@ lei@@ be there are trainees , training places , school courses , one @-@ euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants that have to be found or set up .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; tells Reg@@ ine customer .
many work in the building yard or help households , carry out charitable work - and this motiv@@ ates and very or@@ derly , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reported .
she hopes that the work for the community to create a positive impact .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no employment therapy &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
activity , but not only work .
the day need a solid structure , say Deu@@ el and customer .
people need to develop a sense of commitment .
so there are promotions like sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses .
professional courses are ra@@ r .
so here also management and honorary posts also jump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome in Germany and welcome . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
you need to explain to the refugees that it just takes and they can take a sense of time , for example with language courses .
who eventually develop the feeling that he could not help in Ur@@ bach nobody to work and be useless , who will never integrate themselves .
the clear majority is motivated .
problem cases , there are also , says customer honestly , &quot; people , in which nothing goes . &quot; the work of deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others .
all this is already a &quot; mam@@ mot@@ h task . &quot;
a difficult question : have the two to fear of radi@@ cal@@ isation , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine client quite clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what would be nai@@ ve to call it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a rest risk could not and wants to close them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sensi@@ ti@@ zed the hel@@ pers are already .
these occur@@ ren@@ ces were also subject to the refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they would have the fear that the attacks come entirely in call . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer .
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so we need to keep major and honorary posts on the spot and in the region according to activities .
they have always in the background that a new impulse of refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a ceiling ?
this question clearly answer , do not shy away from politics .
actually , it is unfair to place her hel@@ pers on the spot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ur@@ bach we are not yet there where we want to go , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no new refugees that would be able to relax .
Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bacher are already illuminated , the existing people are reasonable .
these are currently around 100 people , mostly young men .
but when people are in need , they must help them , both women are united .
the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers .
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : bur@@ gl@@ ars were looking for helicopter
