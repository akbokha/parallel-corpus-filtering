<seg id="27">She wants to raise it on 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump does not want to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage has to rally, then he says he should not be changed.</seg>

<seg id="30">Who believe that as soon as they anchor in Germany, irre, says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="31">Even here all-standing women in refugee camps are often considered inferior and worst if abused.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "Alliance of External Side"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended up a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give the hands of the hands and to proclaim the official end of the eight months to the long lasting war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counter at the golden Hall of St. Petersburg's Palace, I cannot deny myself to the expression that Ankara wants to do this reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smiles real and he pointed barely warmth, even for his back-loving relationships.</seg>
<seg id="7">Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke repeatedly by his "dear friend" Putin - according to a report all five times.</seg>
<seg id="8">I could no longer count it.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to its old levels before the crisis, but can even be improved.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day describing a newspaper that Erdogan would have heard so would never happen anything.</seg>
<seg id="11">To me this enthusiasm seemed to imply the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's radiant, sustainable cooling showed that the state of Russia had nothing to forget.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather the cause of the crisis was the first what he mentioned in his introductory words: the shot of a Russian fighter plane to the Syrian border by Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was dropped.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin told him and accused Ankara to please Russia in the back.</seg>
<seg id="16">The promise was even bigger, as it was committed by a friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Vetraud can rebuild it becomes difficult, if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">Months long the state-controlled media resulted in a severe, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At once it seemed to be the Turks to blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">The accusations of senior officials, that Erdogan's own family had benefited from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria, which should be controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He has denied this vehement.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message showed that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting was only held because Putin received an excuse from President Erdogan who he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia was able to book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara the advantages of a cease-fire are obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan is primarily needed all the friends that he can get, after spending last month by a failed government at almost his office.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be facilitated when the flights are picked up again.</seg>
<seg id="33">You are counting on a bellow season of the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week prognostized the state-TV cheaper fruits and vegetables, once the Turkish agrarian imports will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="35">A report in Vedemosti formed it as follows: "tourists there long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry at the West because the reaction to the tried power of power was seen as a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">This continued trell about the snail of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the awakening to it from the cool mood and reduce the relationship between Turkey to the West.</seg>
<seg id="39">Russian State-head won in Ankara with certainty a bonus for having tried at the state of state aid for elected government organs.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "this is well-evident in Moscow that has a self-confidence which has changed even a deeper fear of regime." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "the summit meeting in this beautiful palace on the sea made it possible Russia and Turkey, one how it used to me an analytic," "" "alliance of outsiders" "" ": two countries that have gone out from the West and have now fully resolved." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two countries.</seg>
<seg id="43">The greatest differentiation is Syria, where Moscow recently gave the role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support contradictory pages.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "" "" "it could be significant that after nearly three hours of first talks both Presidents met at the press conference, that they didn't even grasp the subject." ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey refused to answer a question about their differences, while Putin decided to stress this.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster, when the NATO member of Turkey broke the Russian combat jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State had at least talk to each other again.</seg>

<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed for special officer for environmental and transport affairs.</seg>
<seg id="5">In an opinion of Kremlin it is that Putin without giving reasons "the dismissal Ivanov ordered of his duties as chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration."</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who has been appointed Ivanov since 2012 was appointed to his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">1972 was born in the Estonian capital city of Tallinn, he made his graduation at the renowned State of Moscow for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the Kremlin website it is (in Russian) that he later became a director and leader of the government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "he said about his appointment he said to Putin," "" "thank you for your confidence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as a state of state aid and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin told Russian TV Channels on Friday with that Ivanov asked to leave his post and Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convince the most ridiculous faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was a long time of one of the closest trustworthy Vladimir Putin and works like him for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As a staff, he was one of the most powerful men of the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin that was broadcasted on television, both men said that the staff can withdraw his own wish.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smiles for the cameras, here are few of them convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So here is the result of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">This is currently no one knows.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "but the official claim - that a man who was once challenged as a potential president, would like to direct the Russian environmental policy - came across great scepticism." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">In his comments on Putin who quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said, "It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - you could almost say - complaining about four years long ago.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">He previously was Deputy Minister and Defence Minister.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin former member of State Security Service KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin appointed Chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin addressed the power he called Ivanov as one of five people he most trusted.</seg>
<seg id="29">It once was assumed that Ivanov could be president of Russia as a third presidential term Putin would violate the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another, approaching ally Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became prime minister, before he became president three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="10">We are all witnesses of a engineers at a truly epic size in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel, which were used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a tricky activity which require extremely precise tolerances for the fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">Overall, almost 79% of the whole bridge at its place and the last section of the Decks gets today in Rosyth a Betongation for the deck, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place.</seg>

<seg id="15">After installing the last tram section and its connection with the North Tower deck, we had to close the still existing gap on the north or country side.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was reached by dragging of the northern feeder bridge 700 millimetres south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very sensitive activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massively, since the viaduct is 222 meters long, about 6,000 tons, and at an incline of about 3% had to be drawn up.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness, worth it</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to watch how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teenage boys and child will no longer go outside but rather prefer to spend their leisure time on screens, has been lammed over the last decade of many.</seg>
<seg id="4">On Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa to get more active and more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then on video games and finally on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Therefore it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="7">I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that is based on the characters which were initially created for the video games in the 1990s (later, resulting from a cartoon, game cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">Like many phenomena of the population, the interest in the publication of the game sank in the US, Australia and New Zealand in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was postponed by massive demand that overload the server.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and nearly as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, the players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pokémons that are tracked with a GPS and once they were found, "photographed" (via a screenshot on the phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was still younger, joined the Wahn and sprang out for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the United States, the game led to a considerable increase in steps that puts the "average" person every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, the 35.000 users repersecuted, the Washington Post recently concluded that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of persecuted people who jumped every day 30 minutes, from 45 percent to 53 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company doesn't know who plays Pokémon Go - it only looks the raw data for an increase.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "many public awareness campaigns to health that people want to take" "" "take 30 minutes of time," "" "walk from the sofa" "" "and" "" "everyday at deaf ears, because many public messages are boring to health and come from people that look forward." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sport can not be evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Anyone who drives regularly sport, reduces its chances to protest to cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus, three pillars of health covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even join the hunt even new friendships.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always, there are also mexpediatric toys, who must always complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could walk against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What should it be?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has become a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit already were able to trace our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to do sport as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its charm and use it with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because of Pokemons's success, however, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activist in the real world and help many people in the hunt to be active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I present to me under the Women's Women's World War, and that is more than a reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First, I have been at every summer Olympics, and the USA had never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly: this team has three turbines, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren, "Laurie" Hernandez, inspired for many young girls of other skin colour.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jüdin is and Madison Kocian, which is catholic, round, makes every proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has paved the black and hispanic female presence at the head of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years the number one among the female gymnast was an Afro-American.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the last Olympic Games we visited Gabby Douglas a surprising Olympics and America.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now, the world was able to be witness to the incredible performance of the triple world in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they were unexpected, but masterful Gymatic routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American, who won gold at an individual multi-fight event for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Manning member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We are experiencing the top of this sport, but we do not see turnaround in the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie smote all the same way as Aly and Madison, to create it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the "Lem Five" because the next Olympics are just four turers in the team. besides, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality looks so that Turves are a more expensive sports and gymnasts primarily can be maintained in private sectors which are maintained by parents, which are for training, furniture, travel and hotel costs (for the trainers and their turbines and families). the list can be set to any number.</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of this gym lie in a prosperous suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these associations, the Turner receive their overall training and that is a long-term commitment to the families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer by Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, Trainers from Laurie Hernandez, trained both their athletes, since they started with the turf.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to be inspired by the municipalities of innumerable, young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, a service-barth and easier to access turntraining.</seg>
<seg id="23">I was founded my turnaround 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="24">We offer a free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban young people (mainly black and hispanic) and trained national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer the youth high-quality gymnastics who earn the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Turs develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and identification for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It's the inspiration of this team who want to bring thousands of young girls to be interested in the gymnastics and that is great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sport, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is a so exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thanks to Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real presentation of "Girl power" by the Holen of the Olympic team. thanks, Fass you are motivated as many young girls with different backgrounds to begin their way, healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="2">The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video of Dailymail.com could make it a bit safer for you.</seg>
<seg id="3">We talked with Rhon Mizrachi, a Grandmaster of the Krav Maga Verbandes in New York to find out how to move with armed robbers on the distance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Regardless of whether you're approaching from the front or from the back, this video will show you how you can turn your thief for your thief.</seg>
<seg id="5">When you turn to you from the back then you should turn to yourself as a first, so you can see your attacker and "go out of the walnut," says Mizrachi.</seg>
<seg id="6">Grab the weapon then between your front arm and your shoulder before you hit it with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">Sow him sothen with the knee into the body and twisted, while the attacker brakes up pain, the weapon from his hands. hit it with the run into the face and move backwards while they set the weapon up on it.</seg>
<seg id="8">At attackers that approach from the front, the technique is similar - move your body from the buzzling, grab the gun and turn it, so that the attacker can not shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">Grab the weight on the gun simultaneously and beat the attacker to the chest, then turn the gun out of his handle before moving backwards and align the weapon up on it.</seg>

<seg id="8">In addition, practical problems come: in the holidays are helpers that distribute the posters, balloons, flyers, and end up voices, only tiresected.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until 4 September 2016, the election and the last year of the Feria Day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to leave even an election campaign against the people over themselves.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it is also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD / CDU coalition, must be afraid of his office.</seg>

<seg id="33">Also in the customer interest, it is important to avoid any other damage that does not have anything to do with the scandal that comes to an uncertainty with regard to possible warranties as it was.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination plates: who does not buy sound plates?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men middle age love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you apply to the comment ropes, to replicate it under the pseudonym non-allabmen-mediums with smoother insults, this statement is derived from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the diverse redevelopment of sound plates is not attributable to a boom in millennials that would like to greet the re-accuracy of physical objects but due to Midlife-nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have recently bought a record are all foresight at the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most likely Killing group.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not hordes by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older turntables retain their feelings more for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it alone time to spend their time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">When this blog would be a news report on TV, I would follow the camera as I consider in the midst of a busy road in Soho, a modest dazzle trage and wild, before I steal, keep my hands and a certain determinative say, "so, let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So let us take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even if the heart Sohos slowly gets to its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent sellers were based - there are still a handful of fantastic record stores.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to turn the camera to the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to cherish their age and minds.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I followed by Sister Ray (data number: eight young women, three men middle age) into the Recumbent Records (data number: eight men middle aged men, a woman, probably about the 20) is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector that I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "I already appreciate" "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records, above mentioned (he sent me the snapshots by e-mail, I am not followed at home), dress the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he possesses such a considerable number of albums and singles, the result of his available income: he is now able to buy plates that he could not afford to buy them and again buy items which he sold, when he was young and bankrupt.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy, are from the late 60s, early 70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I have probably been young to buy them," says he.</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy plates, rather introverted and like to spend alone time, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink very much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my Laster.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets on the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">But he also noticed a new wave of people who have been influenced by the media, people who have heard about the comeback and set itself again to buy their old records.</seg>
<seg id="24">Of the conversations that I have led, people usually have been drained in the same way around 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers that once sold their records to buy CDs, now sell their CDs to buy again their records, "says he.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom of trailers of a particular age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional importance of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It only takes a few seconds in a store like Phonica, to realize that record stores a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older customers participated in the contactless payments system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to withdraw to the stability of familiar noise grips, of objects, the happient Jugenderers.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think, sometimes it can be the colt of a void or of the possession of material owner than a kind of consolation," says WEZ.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is my collectors as a collectors so I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to mentally employ mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "Fleet a staff from a plate-pile." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey of ICM in April uncovered that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month, they have not heard yet.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey took place also that 41% of a record player possess that they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record, no record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the message I would probably be very concerned, while I was blurred by a stack of Bossa Nova Compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works in sounds of the Universe (data number: three men middle ages) has noticed a "trophy" of the Revivals.</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone came only recently here and said," I do not have a record player, but I would like to buy a radioher record, so that I can put them into the shelf. "</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage but it definitely happened.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive, less music-cled.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "we have people who say:" "" "I have no record player." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older, who only slowly get purported.</seg>
<seg id="44">Mop, which has dedicated the sound plates almost a whole floor, has a bundered audience when I cleanse.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make pictures, teenager and women middle age.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the aforementioned shops - Wild Beast New Year's synthesizer- and sexcunning Pop instead of experimental jazz, reconciled from the loudspeakers - it is good to see such diversity among customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks somerous but nader psychological traumata are difficult to determine if one stands next to someone 30 seconds long.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, runs for a few minutes in the business and looked upon the variation of the plates available for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It makes more an immortal mortal as a large one.</seg>
<seg id="50">It does not deserve much, therefore the collecting of plates is not a real option, she says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs much.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way, but the beauty of records is... "she is driving with a lover sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it is truly unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a shop, which is said that a new generation of record lovers should have inspired by: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I give to the Annoises the jeans hotpants to patterns, I observe a group of young teenagers that will be grouped for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter are superior to buy a crosley record player.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left there is a stairwell, a wall full of records of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential sheets for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">Nobody looks at her - maybe because they are only purely decorative, some as far above that it is impossible to write them.</seg>
<seg id="58">"" "it is pure" "" "record" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that any attraction for these objects mean more money for the industry and to send some customers to the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain.</seg>
<seg id="60">There is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, the one that is most suitable for luxury objects like plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even if my research studies took that the results of YouGov vote, let them, at least in record business in Soho, the large number of female collectors, who exist in reality, record business and online-forks, unconsidered.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday morning with certainty with certainty with certainty by stores of Berwick Street and the leaves by plates, while they flatter the view of an uncanny, 30-year false moderator, which rises over the shoulders of nothing wrong men middle ages.</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Britain at 7-er Rugby came in the finals on Thursday evening to a abrupt stop at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis when they were beaten with a result of 43-7 at the Dec stage here in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji has shared a master class in handling, side-Stepping, post-back, line-up and rotating power to win gold - her first olympic waist of any colour.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was destroyed by the not too bad trostprizes of the Silver medal - Great Britain's fourth day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they smote New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The distinct defeat of the Bocs, 7-5 in the semifinals on the same day could return to them in the finals.</seg>
<seg id="6">But irrespective of it, Fiji should have beaten in this form a 15-man team.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a consolation for GB - but will probably not - that at least a Brite tomorrow will hang a gold medal around his neck: Fijis boss Ben Ryan, the former boss for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path behind him.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, she lost at Ryan every game at the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This sleeves will be weed, but the progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji started wonderful and caused the attacks GBs off fun exhausts.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. in, as if one would run into driving buses. the World Series winners went 5-0 to the top, as the Osea Colinisau in the corner touching.</seg>
<seg id="14">With four minutes of playing time, Jerry Tuwai had another attack from the right corner which he turned into.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly has the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A heavier raining of Mitchell stopped the mountain from Mann Leone Nakarawa to achieve a third gate, but Fiji has only stopped Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua has a touchdown in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new since the re-appearance and there was still a minute of play... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou prespked by further weak tacklings of the GB teams and stormed up to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The transformation brought a 29-0 to the break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It's been as if Fiji was born to play the 7, while I was still going to read.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB introduced fundamental changes to the half-time and completed the fijic gap... for whole four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half time until Joshua Tuisova ran after a brilliant stopplay of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left-hand corner of a 36-7, but the game was running long in favor of the south-selling islanders, whose fans sang, flags and danced on the bleachers.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not hard to admire the playful approach Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame put the cake icing on the cake with another attempt in the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The pad, the Fijis impoverished, and GB kwarns crushingly beaten in the lawn.</seg>
<seg id="28">Formerly on the day Fiji Japan had been defeated in the semifinals with 20-5 and Britain urged South Africa in a scarce semi-final match from the race - Great Britain conversion of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the Bocs in the first half to the front, but Dan Norton broke down the line with impressive work and achieved a gate under the post in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late Tacx of Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-occasion teams, secured the gain - and therefore the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="4">Even if there were only those who were sitting at the show, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the Trainers Robin Williams, was allure as she graduated from the second Olympiagold in two without a tax lady, the first women in the history of British sports that laid on such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Your dominance was absolutely, after all you have 39.ter untrained usage, which is also unparalleled.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant Athletinside which glide about the surface with the elegance of sponge, which reflects not the type of trim it too daze.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind each gold in ruin there is a battalion of wild heroines which make the difference and there was no one assistant than the coach who would not know about 30 months ago, whether he would survive this day even when he was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said he was risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had brass cancer, which is operiding and this did it.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not do that, it spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a rather narrow situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little bit of view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio were lucky that he could be at the beginning of 2014, out of season, could begin what the break kept to a minimum, in case that under such circumstances is the correct term.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I needed to go better again soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in the hospital and ran on the station around - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet to a time when they said that some steps would suffice.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rowing in itself is a challenge, but this makes it an even bigger one.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the infertility of victory, their first thoughts on Williams, which had a nerve-rise in the morning a little more than usual to talk and tried to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">Stanning that was as captain in the Royal Artillery Regiment in a bet in Afghanistan, "I was this week an emotional wreck. that's perhaps something extremely, but it means so much."</seg>
<seg id="22">It repeated only how much I mean to how much I and Helen and also Robin worked.</seg>
<seg id="23">It was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin, we would have no one, therefore a massive thanks to him. he is the best trainer in the world.</seg>

<seg id="2">The singing has accompanied her whole life: as young girl she was in school choir, in the teacher studies, she took the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sang in a seniors.</seg>

<seg id="6">Because singing is equal from several perspectives a great hobby for seniors, says Erhard Hackler by the German seniors.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most seniers sing in the choir and share with like-minded the joy of music, describes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through regular co-operation the seniors can establish and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because often social and family-family structures at age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this experience also has made Ursel Kipp in their choir:" "" "speak and organize themselves on the others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be exhausting in a positive sense, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">Because the seniors exercise a deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Whoever asks his lungs regularly, but also in everyday life not so fast from the puppet.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even though it is about getting the sound of the voice in old age, Singen is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">In older people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Labour Association of the seniors.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations the joint struggle had a much higher place, it belonged to everyday life, both at school and in leisure time, explains them.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz frequently observed that singing or listening of songs in older people arouses many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">Through Liedtexte and particularly melodies, even denying themselves halted people in long lying events.</seg>
<seg id="19">At Singen the head also requires a special achievement, explains Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="20">Focus at the same time on their own voice and a predetermined rhythm and adapt themselves to the other singers - this is a huge cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Especially elderly who live alone so that not only concentrate on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that one learns through the singing in the choir, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Even the self-esteem grows through the singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show yourself: if I do for a long time, I will be better and more vigilant about me - this experience reinforces.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start with singing, so there is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Whoever wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he means to have little talent, betraying Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="28">You're not alone - at 50 sinks people who sounds there when a sound goes next to it?</seg>
<seg id="29">Looking for the right offer have seniors different possibilities, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">Sings someone from the acquaintances in a senorenchor, you can just connect.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer insights on choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Who wants to sing in a ecclesiastic choir can turn directly to the church or the Church.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senselenium choirs can also be found via the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Anyone who has no access to the Internet can ask the family, friends or neighbors to help with the internet.</seg>
<seg id="35">Who desire has to sing should come to join a choir, milled Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing is doing the soul well and has something freeing - that applies to all ages.</seg>

<seg id="2">Snapchat says that this filter is Anime-inspired, but some observers say that it is improper cent to races.</seg>
<seg id="3">With his filtering tool, it allows snapchat about 150 million daily users to change the reality and play with identities in such a way that is already absurd.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure which might be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are unblooded, especial tools, which generate over 30 million improved selectives per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All missteps will reach the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapchat filters have drawn criticism in the past, in which they were accused, that the app has been shaped of Blackface or white skin as beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">When this week some users proposed a filter that gave them sling, false teeth and troubled cheeks, there were some critics called a racist caricature of Asians - "gels."</seg>
<seg id="9">They asked yourself whether these repetitive controllers pointed to a larger problem that the company has with diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and the indignation were widely spread on Wednesday with reports from The Verge and motherboard, one day after Snapchat, that it would have been disabled.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company had an apology: the filter was meant as homage to Anime-characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders that have experienced Rassissm, reminded the filter at hurtful Klischees.</seg>
<seg id="13">Other reasoned the anime-comparison decided.</seg>
<seg id="14">In an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, an Korean-American art student whose tweet over the photos were widely used that the filter was "hurtful and eased."</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it was difficult to argue with the counterposition of a very conflicting Asian caricature and the filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not-sighted, but that the terrain was drawn up to the decreasing extremim.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses these cultural movements.</seg>
<seg id="18">The American culture seems to be implicated in an endless seal and integration, from meeting rooms up to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats great audience of young people - who are in the matter of race as their older counter-players - could be expected rather to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">If one is created by Snapchats filtering a picture is so much more difficult, that such things remain unnoticed when it was the case, "said the 25-year Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday decided Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineering in the medium to delete their Snapchat account and ordered others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an essay for medium and in a telephone interview she said they believe that racist controversy is a lack of diversity among the employment practices at Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu criticized the big part white, only male leaders and ended up with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce, so that they can make such decisions," said the Chinese me-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors that are working there, but are not in locations where they feel safe or comfortable in order to say something about it."</seg>
<seg id="25">Others share their opinion, a complaint, the Snapchat mostly unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its employees and points to its status as a private company.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Thursday, there was Snapchat to discuss the cultural backgrounds of his staff, but according to a spokesperson, the company recently focused on a personnel responsible for focused population groups and on internal integration efforts.</seg>
<seg id="28">Zhu said in turn her snapchat account will be closed and added, "I wonder if they need more users like us to say that that is not OK."</seg>

<seg id="4">The Central Command, shortly Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls the American military permutations in the Middle East and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"news of the information provided by high-level CentCom Kommandees typically were a positiverge picture of the American efforts against terrorism as it would have allowed the actual states on site and were typical positive as analyses of other news services," commented an article article.</seg>

<seg id="9">Although there is no direct evidence that Government spikes under Obama has given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts got exposed to the pressure from their superiors, an optimal image of the threat of the Islamic state, also known as ISIS or Isil.</seg>

<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the investigations were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported by investigating the General Inspector of the Pentagon, which were taken after complaints from CentCom analyst.</seg>
<seg id="24">Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Presentprecher of the Pentagon, gave in an opinion that the Defence Ministry had no reports of Congress, while the investigation of the general practitioner is still under way.</seg>
<seg id="25">But he also gave that "experts sometimes quite diverting opinions concerning the interpretation of complex data and that the intelligence services and the Department of Defence will welcome a controversy on these important topics of national defence."</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations on the question of a successful aign campaign led by American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim that is made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence).</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the accusations of last year have raised the question, how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest and military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism of the secret information on the Islamic State reminiscent of more than ten years ago, as a CentCom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a writing about how the then government under George W. Bush against the recommendations of many analysts examine only a small occupation of occupation in Iraq and have little time to concentrate on the consequences of the invasion of 2003.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the revolt against the current coverage of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, the team led by Mr. Hooker to provide Mr. Hooker to disregard the statements of the government attacks against those from the Islamic State and had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, since these tentative refinement had put into operation to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">However, this knowledge was not published, reported the Times in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">Centcoms damalal Command holder, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the legislature for his overly positive assessment of the war situation during a hearing before the Senate.</seg>

<seg id="1">The United States wins fourth match in the field hockey of women, a showdown with Great Britain.</seg>
<seg id="2">One day after they had shot three gates during a 6-1 winner over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two gates for the American Feldhockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the American players won with 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five gates in two games should actually represent a decent performance, but messenger (27) said they could not remember that have ever done.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no idea." she said.</seg>
<seg id="5">I don't belong to the people who keep their gates in memory.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, that knows they: the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are equal in their group with the Britain on the first place, after their 2-0 victory against Japan.</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet for the first round on Saturday in the last game.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals, the game will decide which of the two within their group will gain the first and second place in each group.</seg>
<seg id="9">The firstplatformer will take a little longer from the path that the other group will lead.</seg>
<seg id="10">As always the game may go on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising vertebrae by their success story, four years after they landed in the past London games on the last of 12 places.</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years a hockey game in hands (their two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), with 16 years she became a national player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team.</seg>
<seg id="13">They missed the Olympiad in 2008, since they could not qualify for the cadres.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012 in which for her and her team everything went wrong.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the following year Craig Parnham became an Englishman, trainer of the national team and thus began to contact things for better.</seg>
<seg id="16">"a cultural change, a mental transition and a physical change," said Bam.</seg>
<seg id="17">We did not have the working time in London, which we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have the rod completely rocking.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening, Bam the Torrigen opened in the first half of the game with a handle from the local area.</seg>
<seg id="20">India was gone without victory in the tournament into the game, but the team showed itself surprisingly strong and kept the pitch from 1-0 to the third quarter, until Bam the game took up into their hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">She led a sprint with the flat ball over the left side flange, then moved to the middle and lute the ball into the gate around the Americaners to get a 2-0 guidance.</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Shutout was the first of the entire tournament for the Torkeeper of the USA, Jackie Briggs who had to advance a gate in each of the previous games.</seg>
<seg id="24">It has a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">Just as well as Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"we are in a good position," said Parnham, but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday.</seg>

<seg id="1">Middle of the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, how late it is, it is the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro feel consistently and indifferent, a rapid staggering to competition and aspiration.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is, as if the olympic torch itself would be a burning stubborn from the wristband to the swimming pool to the gymnast to the triathlahs.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can not switch on TV to read a newspaper or listen to a conversation at the Coffeepers in the Coffeeshop without hearing from Simone Biles, Katie Lecher or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is also Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women's warm with grats, could quite be sent among these known names, built up to Prime Time, constructing through sponsors and charity, if he would be swimmers, turner or even feet.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fighting in the olympic trampoline for gold.</seg>
<seg id="9">The olympic flame does not illuminated any event in the same way.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, partly in the shade are the sports which are not generally accepted: air pistol shoot, archery, badminton, Taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast swim and may have dominion it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I might make modest arguments for my particular darling, then let me draw attention to the discreet charme of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline has been a Olympic event already since 2000, a Olympic event had already seen as it had been in Sydney, it was the last 16 years so sparse that many those, I had questioned did not know that there is a Olympiad of the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes to competition, there has never been a medal in the trampoline, and had had a athlete with up to 2012.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians to share for women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline has a certain outsiiterate charme, partly because it sounds for the unenlightened ear suitable for a clownsschool than that sounds for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a sublime enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorous potential - cartoonous trembling of his never to end clouding - but also the Grazie of turnaround and diving, the two sports that it essentially united.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means so much like "springboard."</seg>
<seg id="22">Emerging winner jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements (rotating, piper and otos) before they land on your feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "they are evaluated according to official Olympiad after execution, difficulty and" "" "flight time" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Two-rounded athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, are competing in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic Vector is straight.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists need to go further in their quest for gold faster, upwards and beyond, sometimes up to the finish, sometimes back and back, upwards and down on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They not only hunt the finish line or the output wall, but also in television transmission: the world or the Olympiad of the Olympians.</seg>
<seg id="28">The purposeful endeavour is posh, admirable, even fanatical - and it is enough to even scattering a viewer to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I think even when looking at these games as something ertiresome.</seg>
<seg id="30">Of this, the trampoline offers a reprieve.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is the top.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she blazes, seemingly heel like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back to top.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is a competition, of course not without difficulty but during exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no vaults into the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and sword.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and end of the women are held on Friday afternoon, in the streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also around 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the Endrunden as part of a afternoon at both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of Olympia Manie they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that will probably be overlooked at the general tumor.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase of awareness can only be achieved through the ointment and the lens of male athletes, according to The Wall Street Journal recently proposed - then Mr Dooley anticipates his new heel, new fancommunity.</seg>

<seg id="1">"a Generation protest" in Ethiopia, Long An ally of the USA</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators, the political changes in Ethiopia are calling for violent resistance to the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that seventy men were killed while the clash with the police were killed.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just going to break together?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the last ten years it was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid allies of the West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months the protests against the government shaken the country and spread in ever more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people rushed to streets and demanded political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The answer of the government was unmerciful to human rights organizations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses believe that policemen were shot in zig unarmed demonstrators and slew.</seg>
<seg id="11">Moving across the protests, which are probably from the last or beginning of this year, show how security people are young people with sticks, while these were forced to make a hand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN High Authority for Human Rights is now calling for an outgoing investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in future it becomes even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa the International Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is to Nigeria the most populated country of Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence services work closely with Ethiopians to fight terrorism across the region, especially in Somalia. only few countries in Africa, if at all, they get much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopian economy expanded in a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new shift in the capital Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">The streets are generally quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organizations have continued the oppression of the government - the opposition in the country has been limited, with dissidents were effectively brought to silence.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent to exile or in prison, killed or put in the wilderness of the wilderness.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you suppress people and do not have any other options except protesing it breaks off," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopian.</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protest.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous ailments that cover everything from the ground use up to the stranglehold in terms of power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a further criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies gained the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, the tensions continue along the border to Eritrea; a struggle for this jagged, controversial line called for June hundreds of lives.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analyst fear that separatists such as the Oromo-Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which have been imposed more or less imposed over the past few years, they could arming the turbulence.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of the biting after years of the worsening under the surface now explode.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems to be harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years a lot of Ethiopia have been able to communicate with social media because cheap smartphones have been more frequently and improved the internet services.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government has access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do at regular intervals, especially when protests, doing, many people can still communicate about Internet proxies who conceal where they are staying.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians gave to that they were so called to protein.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For eons of prospered the Amharas, which come from Ethiopia in the most Christian countries, in politics and economics, while she exploited the Oromos, many of which are Muslims and live in lowland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this is also changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are here to coordinate under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests found in areas of the Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, which accounts for around 6 percent of the population and which are dominant in the military, in commerce and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebellion of vine, was up to his death on a not sovereign disease in 2012 17 years of Ethiopian prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was seen as tactical genius; a man who could think of corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly well versed in order to use early signs of dissatisfaction and to use special officers to deal with opponents and make them be harmful.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime lacks it in this fundamental skill," "" "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analysis." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopians new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen by relatively unsupervised reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr Meles, who came out of the Tigray of Northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence that controlled by the Tigray controls.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the outcome will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time Ethiopia was a rebellion of such a turmoil, after thousands of elections protested, according to analysts, apparently, were seemingly fuged from the government and subsequently stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the following sweeps many demonstrators were killed, even if it was less than in the past few months, and this time of unrest went relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Ethiopian leaders Ethiopians leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, like the new pellet move, as well as for its measurable progress in poverty reduction.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this does not prevent the intensification of the internal missal of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it adopts a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">The last month of attacks in gondar, an amharan city, of Tigray, and the hatred of the Tigray, becomes more and more common in social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts are saying that the protests of the US and other Western allies bring together a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Drongen-flights over the neighboring Somalia, even if she met recently that she has closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">"" "" "" "while the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his allies collapsing in a already volatile area." ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump is explaining his claim Obama has established ISIS 'sarcasm'</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump was trying to dissipate the last controversy on Friday that surrounds his campaign by introducing his multiple repeated assertion, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the "founder" of the Islamic State, not seriously meant.</seg>
<seg id="3">These clarifications put new questions on the communicability of the presidential data of the Republican to whether he is able to communicate clearly and understand with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "it also brings his fellow-offites who make efforts to take him during an eventful phase in protection, to explain in the peculiar position, statements that he could not have meant at all." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">After having made the hint at a voting event on Wednesday night, Mr. Trump was made regarding the claim on Thursday and consisted in interviews that he really did not intend to suggest the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning Tweet on Friday said Mr. Trump, he is just Sarsarcastically.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Tweet was contrary to the previous day when Mr. Trump said in a number of interviews, he said the accusation totally seriously.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative radiomorator Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump wanted to weaken the statement a little weaken it by reminded him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy it, the Republican presidential diddidacy did not know anything about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of the critique crushed on Mr. Trump, while he tries to direct the focus of his campaign because of falling transformations to the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton kept the speeches of the economic situation in Michigan in this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump was trying to return to this topic again.</seg>
<seg id="12">On Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clintons proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already earned sarcasm already to its defence.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he said strong criticism of himself, when he said, the Russians should hacking Mrs. Clintons Eemails, but he later said "Natural I said the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic boundaries in politics and then cut back as needed.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are taken from his fans, as they arrive, and then appropriate," "" "depending on how the reaction fails." "" "said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">But I also believe it is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of making the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has still assumed an estimable sound, since its refractures would continue to go back.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey of NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist who was released on Friday showed a guided tour with a big advantage in the federal states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head-race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "while Mr. Trump is generally tried to apologize for his provocative statements, he often accused his critics, his statements to distort or his humor wrong." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he is strengthened in the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps jokes have brought his loyal fellow-arms into the uncomfortable situation, regardless of how provocative may also be his statements.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trumps prominent intercessors, gave great effort to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," Mr. Giuliani, he said to the correctness of Mr. Trumps said statements, whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organisation, he called her backgrounds, completely wrong and therefore it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most mainstream republicans try to argue that the government served under Obama, in the Mrs. Clinton as a Foreign Minister, ISIS 'allowed to spread out to spread the situation in the Middle East more aggressively.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and cast them off to ride on each of his words and be taken against it.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he despised the" "" "poor, jämmery" "" "TV expert who try to understand him and said," "" "You Can't!" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2">In March 1933, shortly after his climb to the President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.</seg>
<seg id="3">As a gourmets, President Roosevelt had a Faible for refined delicacies of Fifth Avenue such as Pâte de foie Colas and Maryland Waterfall soup.</seg>
<seg id="4">His menu on this day was something humble: filled eggs in tomato sauce, potato pree and as dessert a pflaumenpudding.</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman.</seg>
<seg id="6">Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to the Americans how to eat."</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historian.</seg>
<seg id="8">Coes last book "Chop Suey" acted by the Chinese cuisine in the U.S., while brick in her book "97 Orchard" has been telling about living in a residential house at the Lower East Side of the food perspective.</seg>
<seg id="9">Their latest collaboration, "A decent meal" which is published on Tuesday at the Harper publisher, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="10">You showed culinary solidarity as they meet with a reporter in the Eisenberg's sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, schnörkellosem Imbiss at the Flatiron District, which is already in the business since the IPY, 1929.</seg>

<seg id="19">In the years before the Great Depression was the table in a American household, especially in rural areas, an All-You-Can-Eat buffet.</seg>

<seg id="38">He ate in an almost gilded dining room and carried a smoking.</seg>
<seg id="39">He was delightful and foreign.</seg>
<seg id="40">President Roosevelt might have committed the same mistake if not his wife Eleanor asked him to stature his stomach with his stomach.</seg>
<seg id="41">As described in the book, the recruiting of a housekeeper with no interest in flavors by Mrs Roosevelt led that the White House brought forth the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most exonest possible. "</seg>
<seg id="42">Many of the species from the era of Great Depression, deal with food, has been rejected as soon as the land came back to the legs.</seg>
<seg id="43">The legacy lies on our continued focus on calories and food, said Ziegelman, as well as on how science was applied to foods.</seg>
<seg id="44">The couple gave to the writing of the book to have understood the eating habits of Ziegelman's mother-in-law - for example how they could not throw foods away.</seg>

<seg id="50">There was no paddling cream, only plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the oldest whirltier is nearly 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland usually come only in winter to finish.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to get an examination on board the ship Sanna into the sea.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was born in 1624 and swims with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to the present day.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenlandhaie has only been grown up with 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">Frightened the Grönlandhai along the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it comes to an average of just 1.220 feet.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it arrives, the five meters long animal speeds on satte 2,6 km / h - and this speed is half as fast as a seal.</seg>
<seg id="9">This of long-lasting lifestyle seems to be a panacea for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal Science "at least of a Greenland who could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," commented Alexander Scheuexperience at the Max-Planck-Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life span that means for vertebrates a world record.</seg>
<seg id="12">Admittedly, the evolution of evolution already suspected that Grönlandhaie will be stony.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only did the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">Grönlandhaie are hard to observe, eventually they live mainly in the ice-sea front of the thinked coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperature around the six degrees Celsius, they appear on the surface usually only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">About the lifestyle of Greenland, researchers know very little.</seg>
<seg id="17">Your time-lupentago measures it, as they run from Spitsbergen six animals with a transmitter.</seg>
<seg id="18">Loot make these sharks nevertheless: in the stomach of a beast, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had the jawbone of a young ice-bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly they chase sleepy animals or patrol at the bottom of ice cream and are searching for carcasses, which torney from higher water layers to the bottom of torps.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues therefore studied 28 Greenland, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in Greenland or Spitsbergen as a result of the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimetres long, while the largest 502 centimeter measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of the animals, analyzes them with the carbon-14-method the linsenator of sharks.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of intraocular occurs before the birth of sharks, which the proteins contained in it will no longer be renewed.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had strikingly high carbon-14 in the lender.</seg>
<seg id="25">Therefore your birth should therefore be in the atmosphere after the early 1960s as nuclear weapons testing a large amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the length of 220 cm lenght length of the smallest animal by the lens, there is a low overshot of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons, it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All major atrocities in their lens, on the other hand, are normal carbon-14 amounts, caused by cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14-clock showed an age of 335 years ago, while the record shark is likely to be 392 years old while the record shark is likely to be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Grönlandhai female will only get offspring if they are more than four metres, was well-known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now, the researchers were able to assign the length of an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">As one of the animals with 392 centimeters are probably at the threshold of the sexually mature and his age with 156 years was determined, Greenland with the multiplication is obviously at least one and a half centuries.</seg>
<seg id="32">Also this is likely to be world-record for fluid-animals.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusaleme live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also the previous record card, a 211 years old Grönlandwal, in whose bacon at the neck was cut a 120 year old Harpoentip, was caught in front of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures often the animals of the animals living there are on sparse.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature - and altern slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep in hot water in cold water, the animals are also often particularly large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, which includes the animal heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much bigger than with an gram elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a small animal lives therefore dangerous and should concentrate on getting as many offspring as early as possible," explains the evolution of evolution.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "" "" "a very large animal should invest some resources more likely to invest in a long life." ""</seg>

<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or adolescents from today, who know how to turn a good Snapchat video (even if it matches everything on Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who stand in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce appeared on the last cover, had the release of Lemonades one of the most successful years of her career.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (4 September) and Berlin (18 September), significant losses for the Government Party and CDU are characterised by the government.</seg>
<seg id="3">This takes representative surveys of the Interdisciplinary Research Institute INSA for the "Image" -Newspaper (Friday).</seg>
<seg id="4">While the red-black Government scooter could continue in the north just below, this is not possible according to the revenues in Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="5">In both federal states, the SPD would be the strongest party and therefore would have good opportunities to continue the government.</seg>
<seg id="6">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD cut from 35.2 per cent to 24 percent a five years ago.</seg>
<seg id="7">The party therefore polled to a survey just under the CDU which could come back to 23 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">The third place is controversial between the left and the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="9">The left margin on 19 percent (previously 18.4 per cent), the AfD would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the country.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Greens hesitated despite slight losses with 6 percent (previously 8.7 percent) in the Schwerin Landtag.</seg>

<seg id="13">The CDU only reached 18 percent after 23.4 percent.</seg>

<seg id="2">E-Mail and Internet in Timlupe: 20 years ago, the Nokia Communicator came to the market.</seg>
<seg id="3">The successor today dominate the world today - his manufacturer experienced a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="4">The device weighed almost a half kilogram and was more than four times as hard as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was thicker and bigger, it was therefore not good in the hand.</seg>

<seg id="10">For a few Euro fans can buy the devices still on the internet, but they are somehow from the Stone Age of the internage.</seg>
<seg id="11">20 years ago, the Communicator was a sensation.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at CeBIT CeBIT in Hannover as an "office in the West Bank format."</seg>
<seg id="13">In fact, the new mobile phone could be sent for then standards a lot: SMS and e-mails were sent and received, also by fax was the Communicator.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even the access to web pages was possible via HTML-browser, albeit slowly.</seg>
<seg id="15">A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna, and the mobile phone could be folded similar to a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then we found a small keyboard and a black-white screen.</seg>
<seg id="18">The price was quite proud of the price: 2700 D-Mark, i.e. about 1400 Euro.</seg>
<seg id="19">The average sales prize of a smartphone in Germany was at 392 euros.</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody was able to guess in August 1996 that the Communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.</seg>
<seg id="21">Since then everything is different.</seg>
<seg id="22">The smart phones are a success story, if not for Nokia.</seg>

<seg id="33">The ascent from Apple began, still today the iPhone is the most important product of the group.</seg>
<seg id="34">Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, who ruled the market, had to see.</seg>

<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate research.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere once was imposed by similar conditions.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously pointed out that the slow turn of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation points out that Venus could have a thin, very similar atmosphere and still turned slowly.</seg>

<seg id="8">The planet probably pointed more dry areas than the earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to accommodate life and protects life from dark.</seg>

<seg id="12">The result are average temperatures, which are some degree cooler than the Earth today.</seg>

<seg id="1">Data cław: so perfide erpresses hackers their ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of Erpress- Malware currently take targeted companies - and are successful in this process.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey conducted by Malware's specialists in Malwarebytes under 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies have been at least once again in the past twelve months, partly several victims of a attack with represser software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies have already had the aim of a ransomware blackmailing.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims paid by the offenders demanded to use the challenged systems and data again.</seg>
<seg id="6">The offenders specialize their represser software according to the observations of Malwarebytes to attack on attacks in corporate networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potential to repressive ransom significantly higher than in private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "we are currently watching a scary rapid evolution of harm software," "" "explains Malwarebytes, Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the" "" "World." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008 most malwareprograms were still designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then we discovered the perpetrators of pressoring software for itself.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "only abroad were the target, but the change to company attacking occurred within the past few months." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works for a simple pattern: once on the computer of a sacrifice, it searches for unlong changed files such as Word-, Excel- or database files as well as archives of pictures and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypts the ransomware and deletes the originals.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then the software presents the demands of the presses.</seg>
<seg id="15">In order to get the final decoding code to the files, the victims need to make money - mostly in the form of cryptomalnutrition.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, where private users use the personal photo database at stake, it is about sensitive customer data or project databases without which the production is shut down.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly higher the damage falls off when a ransomware suggests.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of the affected German firms melted sales loss by Ransomware, 13 per cent had even had to break the business operation completely, in one case people were in life-danger.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, several hospitals were victims of attack, whose patients can be threatened by loss of sickness.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we say the victims always: pays not, you only promotes the problem," "" "explains Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">However, 80 to 90 percent of companies pay, get their dates back.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers it is difficult to reject the demand of offenders in operation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the security researchers of F-secure the crops surfaces and the contact with the presses studied and come to the result: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">You declare your casualties by chat, as they can pay by Bitcoin, establish free-accessible support websites, or unlock for example example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And will private merchants dissolve payments of a few hundred Euros, companies have to pay partly tough and five-digit sums in order to return their data insecure.</seg>
<seg id="27">Given the potentially high and relatively risky profits from the ransomware blackmailing, the hackers are always professional and share the work, explains security expert Chester Wisniewski from Antivirus-provider Sophos: "a single person can write a ransomware about within one week."</seg>
<seg id="28">More likely it is that it is about three or four people.</seg>
<seg id="29">Programmers sell their harm software then in the form of a software construction to the actual press.</seg>
<seg id="30">The previous Malware kits were created by the Malware itself, advice and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"the package includes a adaptation tool, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The presses are then looking for more hackers to spread the fresh purchased software under the casualties.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service industry.</seg>
<seg id="34">So one logs in one of the forums in the underground, buys the set of a criminal and commissioned another way to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">The payment is made per unauthorised computer.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually, the criminals then overs spammer with the spread," explains Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="37">In the meantime, the risk of Ransomware is now known for many companies that secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of companies-IT-makers in the Malwarebytes survey rely on it, Ransomware to be vested with file-back-ups and scannersoftware.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if the encryption of data alone is not sufficient threat to successful exhaustion, the perpetrators put forward with the release of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing," "" "explains Malwarebytes of Marcin Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">This makes damage potential, depending on the type of data still a multiple times higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">In future, the perpetrators could be entirely new goals on the internet of things on the grain.</seg>
<seg id="43">On the HackerConference Defcon demonstrating security researchers as they could get a thermostat on their control with the internet.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter, the activation of such a blocked heating could certainly be a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators are then instead of heating into the future a whole production street in a factory, Ransomware could also be a topic in industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the evenings one is eternally around, at night you can awake even more hours in the morning, in the morning there is no more to think of sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one has such problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch-Institute, about a quarter of adult sleeping disorders, and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently relaxing than not relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How can sleep problems or sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleeping disorders, and there are many causes underlying them, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weiser, board member of the German Society for Sleeping Research and Sleeping.</seg>
<seg id="7">What one understands it is, but the insomnie, therefore an entry and sleeptive disorder.</seg>
<seg id="8">Especially that all often feel many people as unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Bolknecht, Board member of the German HausMedical Association with practice in Anglo-Saxon Varel.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleeping disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind it can organic, mental or behavioral factors, but also drugs are stuck.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not rarely is the disrupture expression of another disorder.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early wake up is especially common during a depression," says Weer.</seg>
<seg id="14">And it may be that different factors are each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">Who, for example, has a belt prematurely, can be bad, guarded every two to three hours and starts blurely, about everyday problems and -worry, are Weaped an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">From when should one be with sleeping disorders to the doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">Who over a period of one month in at least three nights per week does not sleepy and on the day should be compromised to go to the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can vary completely different: it is smitten, tired, unexhausted, has difficulties with the attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has moods or physical discomfort such as stomach or headaches.</seg>
<seg id="20">In order to alleviate the sleep, it is important to find their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">As a treatment options, behavioural changes occur, a cognitive behavioural therapy or even medicines - classical dorms just in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - inrequest.</seg>
<seg id="22">Low-term sleep medical medics are available in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary medical center of the Charité University Medicine Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore one should contact the doctor first in sleeping troubles.</seg>
<seg id="24">He can clarify with examinations whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to the sleeping laboratory, and what happens there?</seg>
<seg id="26">For investigating in the sleeping laboratory, he is intended for example with snoring with respiratory diseases, at bedtime fatigue, or if one does not find the cause of a sleeptive disorder, explained fietze.</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only please do not make a nap," says Fietze.</seg>
<seg id="30">After embankment you go to bed at its normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Besides the electrodes on the body you can carry a nozzles, a chest strap, and a antennae on the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">It also features a camera on the ceiling to sleep.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can people get the problem under control?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of positions that you can sleep for better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Weerania counts: regular sleeping-time and elevator, not too long in bed, on the day do not sleep, do not watch TV to sleep, alcohol, and at night cannot look at the watch - then you start immediately to reckon, and that's all and certainly not conducive.</seg>

<seg id="1">Altconstructions, a couple of Lindeners, interwoven by even a remainder: the Riga road in Berlin-Friedrichshain works at first sight not so, but the police are one of the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">One goes along the road from east to west, one is coming to playing places, a freshing kindergarten and a colades.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "in the facade of a gray house someone has" "" "ugly!" "" "tested." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">Across from a Lidl, which is also soon demolished, will be built already: until 2017 there is a house with high windows and 133 new rentals.</seg>
<seg id="5">Article about this "trendy neighborhood" as the competent real estate company Friedrichshain calls, however, are preferred in recent weeks with burning cars.</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, now, the residents are occupied, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, Henkel has been expressed several times for a tough action of the police against the project, the area as "No-Go-Zone" for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">After on 22nd June the rooms were vacated on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officers, had been patalled three weeks official statements, with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site, spermed parts of the road and kept visitors to enter the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, building workers on behalf of the infamous homeowners the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin administration course decided that the clearance was illegal, and a day later, police and construction workers went down under the cheer of sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon, the road works peaceful: parents are going to walk with children, people sitting on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others entertained.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house projects there is a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left force is not the main character of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in the Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, which draws up three children here, are generalized from the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of houseprojects, they share the concern of rising creeks and ventrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not sound after a pine forest, who wanted to bring about a majority of polishing protection against vandalient on the left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ditch, who of the Berlin-senator and the police between the household and their neighbours are apparently not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional workers "district, which today came to a lower average time compared to the rest of the city, and has a high degree of poverty.</seg>
<seg id="18">Household projects and the native living projects have already been part of the pines: in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, among which almost the entire mainzer street very close to the town of Riga.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer was evacuated under a big police battle, many of the projects were legalized in the town of Riga and are still inhabited by people today who had occupied them 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the district has become increasingly popular for the magnets for tourists and the electorate-liner from all over the world: with them the inhabitants of the GDR-Time and former home occupied their pine trees.</seg>
<seg id="21">This also noticeable in the rental period, which has increased almost 60 per cent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the newbuildings in the town of Riga are attacked as symbols for this development: they recognize them coned slices or freshly made facades created with color-exploited.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "no other street was mentioned this year along with the words" "" "linear violence" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason why not all neighbours look at it as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes such as postinfringement are affecting statistics almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most part of the criminal offences make damage resulting from the rebuilds of new buildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has worked for 17 years in a rental building next to the controversial 94, there can be no talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">As for violence, it is descriptive; the people in the 94 are their neighbours, which were certainly not.</seg>
<seg id="28">Also the famous burning cars had no longer exist in the town of Riga.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the studied architect, her street is not a crime point, on the contrary: "here one helps one another, lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer has become aware of the Riga-Straße and remained intact.</seg>
<seg id="31">For this reason, it was also so important that the local residents got back their road: from the police, the politics and the media, which in July all suddenly claimed the interpretation of the district.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of inhabitantas such as Neugebauer, the road will continue to be taken away: sighted newbuildings in former buildings that impose the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "these are ultimately condominium, which are not interesting for many of them - here are rather people who are not so well drunk," "" "says it." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "violence and destruction can I have absolutely no" "" "healing" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should one do if someone is never listening to anyone?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration on all sides, even with the police and the residents.</seg>
<seg id="37">For adding more colours, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the homework projects and the left scene belonged to the pines.</seg>
<seg id="38">Who hered, should be aware of - just like anyone who runs in a pub, who can complain about noise there.</seg>
<seg id="39">All persons provided with names have asked to be called by their correct name</seg>

<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact for integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">In addition, she is a social worker on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July Annika Deuschle the refugee commissioner for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Social Pedgin supports the team of management by Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees itself as a contact person for all players: refugees, Arbeitskreis Refugeology, Administration, authorities and who else is still misled.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine customer from the working circle indicates that the volunteers are more than thankful that Deuel now is, the thriving Wollmilchsau, which primarily has an issue.</seg>
<seg id="8">So some - less mocked than on the wide variety of you wish to purposeful - meant that the administration wanted to write the place.</seg>
<seg id="9">Searched for was an administrative force with a talent for languages and people, associated with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, just a thriving Wollmilchsau.</seg>
<seg id="10">Yet administrative work is not its central area, means Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organisation, work with the people on the ground and also behind the scenes as well as network activity.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50-percentage point on three years of extension.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "it was high time," "" "says Regine customer, that Annika Deuschle honours and full-time actors supported." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are large and minor problems, organizational, human and insurgents.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon there are new containers in the washing-road</seg>
<seg id="17">An enormous problem, it has been recognized for some time, apartments for connecting-refugees who have been acknowledged.</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">You must place the refugees in your own or rented sitting rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The cost of the construction, the rent or restoration of these accommodations must carry out the municipalities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the Landscape with the commune and job center.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer its apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been designed for some time as very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto the administration finds no private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">So far it is not working so far, it is possible to rely on private apartments, so deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, generalized apartments need to be missed as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers are placed in the washing-road.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, are Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agreed.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a firm Bleibe there are trainees, training places, school courses, one-euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants that have to be found or set up.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," tells Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help households, carry out charitable work - and this motivates and very orderly, as Annika Deuschle reported.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community to create a positive impact.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "this is" "" "no employment therapy" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">Activity, but not only work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day need a solid structure, say Deuel and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People need to develop a sense of commitment.</seg>
<seg id="38">So there are promotions like sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rar.</seg>
<seg id="40">So here also management and honorary posts also jump.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "it is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome in Germany and welcome." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">You need to explain to the refugees that it just takes and they can take a sense of time, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Who eventually develop the feeling that he could not help in Urbach nobody to work and be useless, who will never integrate themselves.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">Problem cases, there are also, says customer honestly, "people, in which nothing goes." the work of deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: have the two to fear of radicalisation, even in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "says Regine client quite clearly," "" "what would be naive to call it." "" "a rest risk could not and wants to close them." ""</seg>
<seg id="50">Sensitized the helpers are already.</seg>
<seg id="51">These occurrences were also subject to the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">"" "" "" "they would have the fear that the attacks come entirely in call." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So we need to keep major and honorary posts on the spot and in the region according to activities.</seg>
<seg id="56">They have always in the background that a new impulse of refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a ceiling?</seg>
<seg id="58">This question clearly answer, do not shy away from politics.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually, it is unfair to place her helpers on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="60">"" "" "" "in Urbach we are not yet there where we want to go," "" "says Annika Deuschle." ""</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees that would be able to relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbacher are already illuminated, the existing people are reasonable.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 people, mostly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in need, they must help them, both women are united.</seg>
