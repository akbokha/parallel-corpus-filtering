the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not very friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as to oppose Teheran &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing activities in the Middle East .
but it is also intended to deal with the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two @-@ state solution .
for many years the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been tense .
Washington acknow@@ le@@ dges the ongoing sett@@ ling of Israel and raises a lack of lack in the peace process .
by the Obama &apos;s Obama &apos;s deal with the Iranian nuclear programme the relationship of the two has deteri@@ or@@ ated .
at the invitation of the Republi@@ can Congress held a controversial statement at the invitation of the Republi@@ can Congress , which was considered a controversial statement to the U.S. Congress which was also interpreted as an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech had not spoken to Obama , a meeting had rejected this response to the election of the election in Israel .
in a call call Professor to have shot his girlfriend
in a not@@ ary , Professor Sh@@ annon joined the police with a somewhat dark voice of the police , that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his home .
it &apos;s important to stress that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; is still alive and probably excited , and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found in the mobile .
inside the house did the officials of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a handful of note , which was ra@@ ined on a white block : &quot; I didn &apos;t do it , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this stood by details of the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that he who travelled in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland , Mississippi , signed , already 300 miles to the school grounds , where he had been killed and killed at the door of the police , E@@ than Schmidt .
Delta State University of Mr. Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that the staff members have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that he has made the f@@ ateful indication sometime afterwards .
until the end of the day there was another death : he took the life when the police picked him up .
a day after the s@@ late in the university , the students and lec@@ tur@@ ers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get an impression of what is motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at the two ends of the state , as well as that , what students and employees who knew him saying , helped a picture by a talented , but possibly difficult teachers to paint .
students said that they were happy on his lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier where pr@@ enti@@ ss died , &quot; he has no history of violence or a criminal pre @-@ history .
Schmidt himself mentioned a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people , &quot; with whom he shared his ac@@ adem@@ ical life .
both taught at the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose teacher has 17 members , and many students visited courses by both .
at the same time there were some incl@@ inations to be problematic .
a student , Bran@@ don Be@@ a@@ vers , who told he said , he seemed too little excited and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him he had at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 with stress .
Lamb left the del@@ ta State University for a lou@@ der for health reasons and said that he had some health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the employment policy of the University signi@@ fied that the promotion , for which he had worked so hard for him , would represent no guarantee of an automatic way to a Assistant Professor .
University president William La@@ For@@ ge said he did not know anything about a conflict between himself and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs launch . &quot;
there are questions that can no longer be able to answer .
after flight from the campus the police took a Lam@@ bs track when he was again in Mississippi from Ark@@ ans@@ as import .
before he could be arrested , he killed herself with one .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner meth@@ el Johnson .
his car was still running in the dri@@ v@@ eway .
it was not immediately clear why lam@@ b went to this house , but Johnson said that he knew he knew the people who lived there .
he grew up in the area .
he joined the university in 2009 , the 3.@@ 500 students in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedago@@ gy .

Carla H@@ air@@ ston said : it was 15 and lam@@ b was 20 when they met through joint friends .
she and her friends were at high school , and he was the cool elder guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar playing .
he was then the woman of women .
all the girls are mol@@ ten when he was there , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson city center of Bran@@ don .
Lamb and pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously a couple of time together .
in the not@@ ary , &quot; I said my wife , &quot; but there was no judgment of a marriage .
they had a dog called Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house , which is adjacent to a ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Or@@ en , said they were left out 15 years ago , but friends have stayed and a daughter who now was 19 years old .
&quot; it was totally wre@@ cked on the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Or@@ en about his daughter .
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
o &apos;@@ ste@@ en said he never met , but due to his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that he was interested in music and blues playing .
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail did both appear on a summer @-@ year market three years ago .

8 survey data that will show that Donald Tru@@ mp is serious to take .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have made it off as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
but no matter how some Re@@ public@@ ans try to drag Donald Tru@@ mp from the upper ranks among surveys down , it has ( yet ) does not work .
ten of the last eleven national surveys revealed Donald Tru@@ mp in the two @-@ digit region and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of real estate &apos;s real estate .
of course , it is still too early in the election period .
neither claims that Tru@@ mp will probably win the republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts said that at this time , Rick Per@@ la &apos;s leadership was handed over to the rising Herman C@@ ain , none of them won &apos;t win a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he could fight in a general election .
but external side groups like J@@ eb Bush &apos;s super PAC and the conservative industry group for Growth are now realizing tru@@ mp &apos;s stamina and begin to let their dollar flow to fall .
here are some current survey data , which suggests that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
Tru@@ mp@@ s expos@@ ures have turned around 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tru@@ mp announced its candidates in mid @-@ June , a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University showed that only two of ten re@@ public@@ ans looked favourable to real estate @-@ Mo@@ gu@@ l .
by the middle of July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August there were 52 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , six out of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
about three of ten say they have a negative opinion .
these figures keep themselves in early States .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa last week noted that 60 percent of the Republi@@ can have a good opinion of Tru@@ mp .
two thirds of the GO@@ P voters GO@@ P would be happy with Tru@@ mp as candidates .
in a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the re@@ public@@ ans , they were either &quot; thrilled &quot; or &quot; satisfied , &quot; if Tru@@ mp would be nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two out of 10 say they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; upset , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he would be the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Ben Car@@ son will tell about the same enthusiasm like Tru@@ mp ( 43 per cent , they would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vs. 40 percent who tell the same about Tru@@ mp ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next in enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio at only 21 percent .
on the other hand 47 percent of the Republi@@ can voters say that they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the Est@@ abl@@ ishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of the re@@ public@@ ans looks like Tru@@ mp@@ s temper@@ ament not as problem .
while Donald Tru@@ mp is widely critici@@ zed for his bom@@ bas@@ tic and offensive statements , 52 per cent of those to the re@@ public@@ ans ten@@ di@@ fying Irish voters that the real Estate Mo@@ gu@@ l have the right temper@@ ament for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number applies in the nation state of the nation , the federal state I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Republi@@ can think that he has the personality for a rest @-@ in @-@ rest , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 per cent , that he did not have the personality to perform effectively his office , and almost six of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament was not in the White House , so ABC / Post .
republi@@ can elec@@ tors get used to the idea .
if they expose their nest , Republi@@ can voters hold ini@@ mp for real .
if they are asked , who won the GO@@ P nom@@ ination after a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week four by ten that Tru@@ mp is the best bet .
this is a change since the time when four out of ten end of July took their money to J@@ eb Bush .
full disclosure : GO@@ P elec@@ tors in the past had not had the clear@@ est crystal ball .
at this point in the last cycle , four out of ten re@@ public@@ ans , that Rick Perry would gain the nom@@ ination towards just 28 % for the final candidate Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless it shows that a large number of GO@@ P voters are shown as plau@@ sible campaign .
even when the re@@ public@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tru@@ mp is going to beat almost everyone .
some experts suggest that the spl@@ itter field is probably contributing to Tru@@ mp@@ s leadership during the anti @-@ trust support to more than a dozen different candidates .
but a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ at @-@ head @-@ race between the chest and most other re@@ public@@ s candidates , Tru@@ mp are re@@ harv@@ ested .
he has lead before Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points , before Walker Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before edge Paul , John Ka@@ der@@ and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
a head @-@ to @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who strikes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ at @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tru@@ mp @-@ fans says they have made their minds .
a new survey by CB@@ S / NY@@ T on Tuesday showed that only a little more than half of the voters want to support the mp , that they have awarded their voices firmly .
of course , much can happen to change this , and no one can truly say , never change the opinion .
46 percent said that they leave the door open for switching to other candidates .
nevertheless , Tru@@ mp@@ s is strongest competition at the moment of the other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon and Ben Car@@ son , but voters that they have made their mind are twice as common for Tru@@ mp .
six of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans say that they are coinci@@ de with Tru@@ mp during the issue of immigration .
since then , Donald Tru@@ mp in his election campaign launched two months ago immigrants from Mexico &quot; rap@@ ist &quot; was the immigration and ful@@ crum point of public discourse in 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some are concerned that the bom@@ bas@@ tic out@@ Pres@@ sion of Tru@@ mp are crucial H@@ isp@@ ano @-@ Americans from the Republi@@ can party , and will damage the new @-@ orient@@ e@@ ement efforts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but , after the new ABC / Post survey , 6 of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans , that they must coinci@@ de with Tru@@ mp for questions of immigration .
as long as immigration remains in the spot@@ light , it will seem to do Donald Tru@@ mp too .
the frustration of the government climb@@ s on new top @-@ levels .
at Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son now strikes about half the support of Republi@@ can voters , especially through their out@@ si@@ ders status .
six of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans say in the new Monday @-@ survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ si@@ der as someone with government experience .
and they are also angry with Washington .
a survey of Des Mo@@ ines Register / Bloomberg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa Re@@ public@@ ans were frustr@@ ated by the Republi@@ can in Congress , with 54 per cent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; hell@@ ish . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential objects in Germany
here in the hobby track there is the most expensive residential complex - overlooking the North Sea .
in the street it cost a square meter mark of an indoor roof in the cut 7@@ 3.@@ 300 Euro .
&quot; on Sy@@ lt the offer of objects is very limited , &quot; says it in the study - therefore the high price .
a new study reveals in which specific layers will cost one square meter most .
of course , 18,@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top towns , one does not expect the price as a pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider angels &amp; Völ@@ kers has released a list of the most exclusive German home sites - with square praise in fluctu@@ ating high places .
there are several ten thousand Euros per square - per square @-@ meter , well @-@ marked .
but good , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not at the top here .

Müller received at his 28 hit in the Champions League for the Bayern @-@ Leadership Award of Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ go@@ alie Roberto , who allowed one as f@@ langes made by the mayor of the world .
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate her , &quot; with Bayern @-@ Kap@@ itä@@ n Philipp Lah@@ m in front of the game at Kar@@ a@@ is@@ k@@ akis @-@ Stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ blo@@ om fans - and the Mün@@ chner was the word .
they showed a concentrated and dedicated concept , without shine .
Piraeus had won his recent six games in the Royal Class , including well @-@ known clubs like Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
2011 I stum@@ bled at Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
but the Bavaria , in seven European ac@@ up spots were defeated with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they went mu@@ st@@ un , with her un@@ compromising efforts , but often to play at work .
the attacks were initiated to many @-@ shift on left @-@ left Douglas Costa initiated , which rarely came through the former Braunschweig declaration of O@@ mar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller from the right more luck , while his f@@ lange is attacked from the right half @-@ board in the left upper p@@ eck .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first , when Olympics @-@ Stür@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown struck the head of the Poles from the line ( 26 ) .
then by director , the go@@ alie Roberto with the knee par@@ ched ( 3@@ 5th ) .
although the Bayern basically lived up their usual game , Pir@@ ate could put forth hi@@ sto@@ cr@@ atic con@@ i@@ fer@@ ous .
on door@@ ke@@ eper Manuel Neu@@ er , he was reli@@ ance .
so approximately , when he had a shot of ide@@ ye on the lat@@ te forces ( 5@@ 6th ) .
in front of Neu@@ er Gu@@ ardi@@ ola left a four @-@ stars with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng who made it well .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero was first given after the final training , &quot; said Sport@@ vor@@ y Matthias Sam@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he who wants to make something else of it , this is already mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even at the first change Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him , when he rendered to King@@ ley Com@@ an for the Anglo @-@ sh@@ re@@ ed Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) .
Go@@ ose came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( 7@@ 6th ) and it made 13 minutes later all clear , by El@@ f@@ meter , Müller still placed one dr@@ one .
in front of the game he had come in the stadium to Kra@@ w@@ alle .
after a smaller group of partly mur@@ dered in Bavaria &apos;s fans in their viewers @-@ cluster , apparently , the supporters of hosts Piraeus with words and gest@@ ures had prov@@ oked them , ass@@ aults by security forces and went out with pen@@ ises against the Munich adher@@ ents .

who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk to lose teeth
who smo@@ kes , not only does the lungs , but also the teeth - that lays to an Potsdam long @-@ term study .
the good news : when fails to drop the risk fast .
smo@@ kers have a significantly increased risk to lose their teeth early .
this is derived from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute of Nutrition research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smo@@ kers , smoking is the risk to lose their teeth pre@@ matur@@ ely in order to fold up the 2,@@ 5@@ - to 3,@@ 6 times higher .
the scientists were observed more than 23@@ 300 participants .
root causes of t@@ apping be c@@ aries and inflammation of the tooth decay , stresses the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis smoking is a risk factor , stress the authors .
the connection between smoking and dental loss must therefore be trac@@ ed on most frequent d@@ g@@ ums among spac@@ ers .
not clear whether smoking is also increasing the risk of dental c@@ aries .
people who listened to smoking , could reduce their risk within a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
but it could last more than ten years to the threat again to the level of non @-@ smo@@ kers , first author , Thomas Dietrich , reported by the English university of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need to convince people that they are to be non @-@ smoking , explained research manager H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking is shortened the life time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
smoking is good for lungs and vessels and leads to our findings also to good dental health up to the high age .
over 20 percent of the population in Germany are affected by tooth @-@ sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness over 20 per cent of the population , divided the DI@@ f@@ E with .
earlier investigations have already pointed out that smoking &apos;s risk for early retirement accounts .
the new long @-@ term study for@@ w@@ alled the findings .

EU Commission to strike a new court in dispute
the EU Commission &apos;s proposal on the planned trans@@ atlantic Trade Agreement ( TTIP ) has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbitration system .
the controversial private arbitration institutions for dispute between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a transparent system , which corresponds significantly more traditional dishes in its operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to establish a system that citizens rely on &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; stated the relevant EU Commissioner Cecilia Malm@@ ström in her imagination . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sh@@ wed@@ der &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has recently concluded the proposal as a European negotiating positions in the EU &apos;s free @-@ trade agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced support .
the TTIP is to create the largest free @-@ trade area of the world with 800 million people .
plans to reform the current arbitration proceedings specifically show that the EU States and the US will jointly choose independent judges for a new investment court .
they are supposed to come from the EU , the US , and from third countries .
it is for the first time also a second instance .
it would allow it to raise an objection to judgment .
until now , the procedures involved lie at each other at the arbitr@@ ators , a obj@@ ections to their judgments , did not give it .
in the discussions of recent months , it has become clear that citizens have no familiar with the old IS@@ DS system in matters of fairness and justice .
over the long term , it wants to work according to its own information on an international business court .
there could be also disputes between Chinese companies and EU states , for example .
the arbitration grants above all are regarded as one of the main reasons for the big resistance in Europe against TTIP .
the traditional arbitration courts are critici@@ zed by oppos@@ ites as a kind of parallel , that the company costs damage to tax pay@@ ers , national laws or reduction of consumer and environmental standards .
in the first sub@@ missions anti @-@ TTIP organisations such as Camp@@ act , the proposals of the European Commission were insufficient .
this was critici@@ zed above all that they should not apply to the negotiated trade agreement with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) .
the German economic secretary of Matthias sei@@ zur@@ es ( SPD ) signed the plans in contrast to great progress .
the Commission considered important points to reform significant points , the Federal Minister , Sig@@ mar Gabriel held out in the spring with other EU trade ministers .
the old system of private arbitration is available from the table .

commemor@@ ative Folk from Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens sit on the stage at the Köl@@ ner Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to it there is a fli@@ p@@ chart that has recorded the shy and paste of the picturesque U.S. state of Michigan with Fil@@ z@@ sti@@ ft .
the entire audience , about 40 persons , is almost seized by Mr. Stev@@ ens .
he tells the stories of various places that he always records on the map and tell what his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ously and delicate songs report .
where they came into being and how it looks there , in his homeland .
since then Stev@@ ens proves to be a wonderfully creative irrit@@ ating .
with the 2003 published and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State , &quot; clever compos@@ ites songs , who seem to be in harmony very close to American Folk of the late six@@ ties but can always dri@@ fting into great op@@ ul@@ ent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it creates the rum@@ ors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michigan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be the first part of a tran@@ we@@ ed series : each of the 50 US federal states should be cons@@ ulted into a row . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but already in 2004 and within the Rhine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has already been published and a positive number of expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Super@@ inten@@ dence of ideas and styl@@ istic fin@@ esse .
the album is entered into the US Bill@@ board charts and is missing in no annual list of the influential music media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after exce@@ ed@@ ingly productive experiments , Stev@@ ens then serves to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive and product pieces . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sixth studio album is still widely orchest@@ rated , but is still supported by programmed sequences or Be@@ ats and plays with all kinds of effect and hall .

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns debut in the fra@@ gment of the Prime Minister
since his election Mr Cor@@ by@@ n debut is expected at the fra@@ gment of the Prime Minister with tension
the new Labour Chair of Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n is supposed to give his debut on the fra@@ gment of the Prime Minister , and to create it for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise up in order to face the first of its six pre@@ determined questions shortly after noon , while exercising his performance by the media is likely to be audi@@ ted by the media .
he called &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he would be able to skip some sessions to leave her colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary trial for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns , because after his appointment it comes to a member of the shadow of shadow and after his appointment at the Tu@@ c Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the decision of the Labour @-@ Chairman , on Tuesday during the singing of the national anth@@ rac@@ ers in silence res@@ igned for the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , and stands at the center of several title @-@ stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ bi@@ ns decision , not to sing the national anth@@ ems , has drawn attention to himself
a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he would have been &quot; in respectful silence &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; Hel@@ dent@@ um of the Royal Air Force in the air battle around England . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ bi@@ ns Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ un@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News @-@ Programme , he got to sing the Labour @-@ chairman , the national anth@@ ems , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished .
almost a dozen of shade @-@ mini@@ stration have refused to serve with Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns leaders , and they were called on differences in business , defense and foreign policy , while less than one of the sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary Party originally supported him as leaders .
the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also st@@ acked within the Labour Party and by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n comments on the European Union &apos;s position and the limit of powers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the Tu@@ c conference giving Labour changes to the whole idea of a total limit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hours later Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ Labour and pensions Ministers said that the Party is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that it was only opposing government plans to lower the limit of 26.@@ 000 £ to 23@@ ,000 £ . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth league president , which David Cameron , since he has been a T@@ ory boss , over the last decade from the E@@ W @-@ Box in the Parliament .
the Labour leader , who promised a different political approach , says that he has made &quot; Cro@@ w@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30.000 ideas .
the Is@@ lington North MP said that the Fre@@ el@@ unde of the Prime Minister has clari@@ fied , and that he is signed with &quot; impact &quot; and the struggle with resistance , and instead , has to focus on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , who is represented in him the shadow of the host country , if he is not participating - for example , if Mr Cameron is on the way abroad .
he also got the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally took the word , and he said John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the Lower House , addressed the issue to discuss the problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he was leaders in 2005 , Mr Cameron told that he wants to move himself from politics in style of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le @-@ theater &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is often linked to the fra@@ gment of the Prime Minister . but a few years later he was living in it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since she was first sent on TV in 1990 , the questionn@@ aires was considered to be the most important bar@@ ometer of a leader and his leadership in the House of Commons and his position under his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although Kri@@ sts argued that she has become a cartoon and attentive reforms .

between May and July the results grew without bonuses in the United Kingdom by 2.9 % compared to the same period of the previous year .
this percentage was the fastest and experienced in @-@ depth assessment at the time of interest rates .
the pound rose by more than 1 % compared to the dollar on $ 1,@@ 55@@ 05 and was climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the euro on 1.@@ 37@@ 30 € .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index was concluded with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 22@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump off 20 % after taking over the ri@@ vals of Riv@@ ne AB In@@ Be@@ v .
a transaction would combine the two largest brewer@@ ies of the world and brands like Bud@@ wis@@ er , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ wing .
Bur@@ berry stocks were after up@@ loading news from the competition Group for lux@@ uries &apos;s chemical products 0,@@ 9 % higher .
Ri@@ chem@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures hit all expectations and also showed that the sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reg@@ im@@ ed growth .
shares of Gl@@ enc@@ ore rose by 5 % after the mining harvest said that it took 2.5 billion US $ by a share of equity as part of its strategy of debt reduction .
the shares of the packaging and paper group@@ ing MO@@ N@@ DI were the largest los@@ ers on the index , and this with a decrease of 4.3 % , after gold was put to sell its rating for the company rating on &quot; sell . &quot;

the chef of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages may end@@ anger the expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher wages for UK workers could mean more buying power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that these merchants be the higher labour costs at his company , he says .
the costs could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that might mean that there are fewer extra jobs .

when Jus@@ tin Bie@@ ber a coffee drinks , you will notice at the wind@@ shield .

some say the h@@ ype up too far .
others say , bending is ultimately just in the U.S. and the United Kingdom with its new single &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; at No. 1 .
Bie@@ ber himself , his fourth album in November will follow , interested in the many zer@@ os .
at least he does so .
PE@@ G@@ ID@@ A @-@ poster brings the Leban@@ ese on potato
potatoes or d@@ ön@@ er ?
it is both - and indeed in the potato @-@ Greenland , who developed the Ol@@ den@@ burger Im@@ b@@ iss@@ owner Han@@ i Al@@ h@@ ay .
inspired by the Sp@@ ru@@ ch &quot; potato instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; on a poster the PE@@ G@@ ID@@ A movement took Al@@ h@@ ay potato and meat together on a sp@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea introduced him to be a poster with a PE@@ G@@ ID@@ A demonstration with the wording of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; potatoes &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which he had noticed on television . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , in his store , there is a barbecue which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; this is Mul@@ tic@@ ult@@ i for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ h@@ ay .
the idea of the Leban@@ ese can now be registered at the German Patent Office in Munich .
in this case , according to the authority , she has recently been protected as a utility model .
as much meat and how much potatoes in the sk@@ ewer , al@@ h@@ ay does not want to reveal .
only so much : &quot; it tasted together even better , &quot; he finds .
also at his customers the culinary international understanding comes well .
Met@@ Cash starts ground @-@ based campaign to combat alarm
Met@@ Cash tries to protect the Ig@@ A @-@ Fili@@ ppo in front of an Al@@ di @-@ Proc@@ ession in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ al@@ ers Met@@ Cash has started an traction @-@ speed campaign to defend the market share of Ig@@ A retailer in South Australia and Western Australia in advance to a 700 million US $ Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di opened the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia in the beginning of next year , Met@@ Cash and Ig@@ A offers their relationships with local food suppliers and expand the brand Ig@@ A through mainstre@@ am marketing and marketing on social media , as well as events like Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show .
Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board with brands like I@@ manufacturers S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distributed in Ig@@ A shops and shop@@ ke@@ e@@ pers , the f@@ illi@@ ed tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ alli@@ c will publish further details of his defence strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ al@@ ers lead out for food , alcohol and devices to its annual investors strategy .
there is much at stake , as South Australia and Western Australia almost 30 percent of Met@@ cas@@ hs Ig@@ A @-@ charging managers and higher pay@@ lines as a Met@@ cas@@ ts@@ Ig@@ A @-@ network will generate in the East states .
purchases in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ or@@ ically provincial and Ig@@ A @-@ retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia in comparison to around 14 percent in Western Australia .
however , analy@@ st , such as Morgan Stan@@ ley , that Al@@ di twelve months after opening its first markets around five percent of the food market in these two countries is pur@@ ged and will take away all existing players , but mainly independent retailers .
a report published in this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath by Morgan Stan@@ ley , that Ig@@ A @-@ retailer 360 million euros per year and met@@ cash will lose 250 million US $ by the end of 2016 .
that progn@@ osis is based on the assumption that Al@@ di is inaugurated in the next year 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA , and generates sales of 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and food business and in the amounts to Met@@ cas@@ hs &apos;s high fixed costs , meta @-@ cash would cost roughly $ 13 million before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ Cash Market shares in the East states , mainly of Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recently managed survey of Roy Morgan found that Ig@@ A @-@ Le@@ ad are the most faithful .
Morgan Stan@@ ley participates , that Met@@ cas@@ hs revenues in foodstuffs and grocery business will drop 3.@@ 8 percent in 2017 and 2.0 per cent in 2018 , reducing the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent to 2020 .
last week , the leading Fon@@ ds@@ manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , at a business eating in Melbourne , that Met@@ alli@@ c will likely disappear within a decade . Met@@ Cash will disappear .
Met@@ Cash rejected it to respond publicly to the comments of Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a member of a member of met@@ cash with Mr Dou@@ glass last week contacts .
IG@@ As market share has declined from 18 percent to 14 percent , and income from Met@@ cas@@ hs dietary and grocery stores , which is about 1,@@ 200 Ig@@ A retailer , which has declined by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting the operating debt reduction in sales and margins .
however , the wholes@@ aler has dri@@ fts and inv@@ ests more than 150 million US $ , selling prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ms for hundreds of products every week , and Ig@@ A retailers in improving their stores with rapidly growing fresh food and deliver a better choice of private label foods .
Met@@ cas@@ hs &apos;s main business leader Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and loading programs to get started and hopes that the wholes@@ al@@ ers will return in 2017 for the first time in four years back to a lot@@ tery growth .
Than@@ x Kok@@ kin@@ akis is supported by President of the Australian tennis court Steve He@@ aly
Than@@ asi Co@@ kin@@ akis deserves more praise than criticism for its behavior .
Than@@ asi Co@@ dd@@ akis was one of the &quot; Kol@@ lateral damages &quot; in the recent storm all around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gios and deserves to be a president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly rather praise as criticism for his own behaviour .
Kok@@ kin@@ akis , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , which is always referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; by the in@@ famous confrontation of Kyr@@ gios with St@@ an Wa@@ er@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters in the spot@@ light .
in a fi@@ ery qualify match in Cinc@@ inn@@ ati soon after that , Kok@@ kin@@ akis and his opponent Ry@@ an Har@@ rison had to be separated twice through the arbitr@@ ators , whereas Har@@ rison had to sh@@ attered by the arbitr@@ ator , and I should hit the child . &quot;
while he was last seen , as he sm@@ ashed a tennis r@@ ack@@ et after a cr@@ unch , a potential US Open victory from Richard Gas@@ quet , was defended in Kok@@ kin@@ akis of He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , in the competition with Sam Gra@@ oth for the second place in an individual behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup finals at Great Britain .
&quot; one thing that I vali@@ ant myself is the fact that in my view Than@@ x moved a little into the battle , &quot; said He@@ aly .
he has broken a r@@ ack@@ et when he lost because of a cr@@ ack@@ et in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken up a bat from Fr@@ ust with himself , and I know Than@@ asi to know good enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the pretty pro@@ voc@@ ative conditions with Har@@ rison and so on and I think he deserved a lot of appreciation .
he has a great team around you , he has a great family around you , and I believe he was treated a little too rigor@@ ously .
he is a very mature 19 year old , he works very hard and he fits in the team and so on , he is never respected a problem with the other players , he is well in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I believe he deserves to be judged for his own merits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to take account of Kyr@@ gios on the major issue of decision , which begins on Friday and he describes the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; common decision &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the right one for everyone , but he ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term fix@@ ture on the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; first , we wish that the team is fully focused on the competition and did not see all of the controversy around &#91; Kyr@@ gios &#93; , &quot; He@@ aly .
and I think that Nick made very fast the rise to what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray took him . he asc@@ ends into the eyes of the public , but we try to support him , we try to think him the consequences of his actions . some time outside the ram@@ p , in which he can only think about it , I consider it appropriate and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary explains Not@@ with@@ standing , closes the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary declares the state and fought the border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all the who tried to come to the country illeg@@ ally . everything with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed the border , as hundreds of migrants gathered in a Lower Saxony and Serbian officials with indi@@ gn@@ ation .
the people who were ch@@ ased before violence , hid for an unknown period in a stri@@ pe on the street between the two control points of the countries and built tents , and they settled down there .
but frustration rose .
as a police helicopter above them , the migrants &quot; Open &quot; Open the border ! &quot; and smells of ins@@ ults against the Hungarian polic@@ eman .
some prot@@ ru@@ ded in protest food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants would be returned from Hungary while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a collision .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have to take in talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence at the Hungarian @-@ Ser@@ b border came one day after the 28 @-@ Nations @-@ bloc meeting in Brussels in a strict meeting in Brussels could make no common immigration policy .
the ministers agreed , however , to share the responsibility for 4@@ 50,000 people who were looking for refuge in the covered Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that after the next month or until the end of the year - an agreement would be agreed that the EU states would include more 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some of Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria demanded a Special Summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however Hungary he did not put his hopes for a direct promotion of Brussels or his neighbors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the emergency , rested in two southern regions , the authorities gave more powers to cope with the crisis so that they were able to block the streets and accelerate asylum procedure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country is also planning to build a bar@@ bed dra@@ in along its border with Romania , to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after having finished a fence at the Serbian border .
CB@@ S News @-@ correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even pr@@ el@@ ins@@ assen in the race , to create the bar@@ bed @-@ wire fence , used between Hungary and Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent months Hungary has grown for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East to a significant bott@@ len@@ eck and entry point into the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban has however insi@@ sted that most of the upcoming economic migrants are looking for a better life , and not war @-@ refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that strongly contradi@@ cted to other EU states , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws passed around midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) tall Za@@ it@@ us who was built up the government along the southern border with Serbia , to a crime . these laws also place higher insur@@ ers for condemned human tra@@ der .
&quot; due to the situation created by the mass immigration , the Hungarian Government explains the state of state , &quot; said Govern@@ ors Zol@@ tan Kov@@ ac re@@ por@@ ters in the southern city of Sz@@ eged .
we say it to be very clear : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must still be able to approve the use of the military , which is expected for next week , but re@@ por@@ ters from Associ@@ ated Press have already seen the hard @-@ armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on Sunday already .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country @-@ safety consultant for Or@@ ban , said that authorities were 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others have already penet@@ rated even deeper into the country .
they come over by sh@@ ame@@ ful the fence , they are now in police sense and are accused of receiving criminal off@@ ences according to new laws .
authorities are to rep@@ airing the fence quickly .
Hungarian officials joined the Tuesday morning also two of the seven border crossing with Serbia , after a rail wag@@ gon with bar@@ bed wire , in order to close the borders .
chaos conver@@ ts the main border crossing close to Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , as the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and thrust a crowd to get over there .
about 20 managed to arrive , but thousands left outside .
another group of migrants blocked the most important motorway connection from Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they travel to Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s lead to Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in the national survey
the former US Secretary of State Hill@@ ary Clinton continues to hold a two @-@ digit growth in the democratic race at the national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders will increase its opposite to the ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections ( 58 percent earlier ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent increase ( rising by 17 percent ) .
Vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not proclaimed the President of the Russian Federation , receives support for 15 percent of the democratic voters of the presidential elections .
more than five months before the beginning of the pre @-@ elections , most democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion stands to which candidates will support them .
but Clin@@ ton &apos;s supporters are more resistant in their choice than those of other candidates .
since the CB@@ S News survey , Clinton has lost over a number of demo@@ graphic groups while S@@ anders obtained some gains .
Clinton maintains a big advantage over women and co@@ war@@ es , but these proj@@ ections have dimin@@ ished .
their support among the men is significantly lower , and S@@ anders is only back with 5 points .
Clin@@ ton &apos;s advantage of democratic di@@ aries under 50 years has become more vol@@ uted , and they are now at equal height .
but Clinton has a big advantage with the older voters .
last month Clinton had been with two double @-@ long lead in the liber@@ als , but it has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group .
about half of the democratic voters of the pre @-@ elections pro@@ found@@ ly say they would support talks with enthusiasm Clinton if they would be nominated by the Party .
a quarter would support them with some rulers and another 15 percent would only support them because they are the nom@@ inee director .
six per cent would not support them .
maybe not surprising that Clin@@ tons are current supporters mainly of her .
the views are more mixed with those who currently support Clinton - just about a quarter would support them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while 48 percent of democratic voters want to say , they can support Clinton with enthusiasm , say less Republi@@ can voters go about their peak @-@ channel data Donald Tru@@ mp ( 35 per cent ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Clin@@ ton &apos;s supporters can be asked in an open question why they want it is the most common response that it has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman has become President ( 13 per cent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 per cent ) .
of the Clinton Sup@@ por@@ ters also their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 per cent ) was also mentioned .
consent to the handling of problems and the constitu@@ encies are also cited .
&quot; &quot; &quot; being the Vice President reaffir@@ ms the potential for the presidential system in the scales , 57 percent of democratic voters want to see him in the race - although a third thinks he should not do it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if democratic voters are asked by the elections , who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top .
at Clin@@ ton &apos;s followers , more than half , that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far before S@@ anders .
decide to start the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , not for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , the Hill@@ ary Clinton gained rise from S@@ anders , from 20 points with Bi@@ den in competitions to 30 points without him in the race .
fifty @-@ five percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as candidate with the best chances to win the election . however , this number of 78 per cent in the last month has declined .
Bi@@ den is by far the second in this measurement , but the percentage that acqu@@ ires him as the &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; has increased .
yet , the question of what is more important with a Candi@@ date , call Democratic voters to questions about voters .
similar to that in the last month no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for this vot@@ er elections were considered in@@ ad@@ missible .
the Democratic candidate or potential applicants can perform good results in some key characteristics of voters in the elections of their party .
at Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and with strong leadership .
for the three candidates in the best place of honesty , while Clin@@ tons strength is the leader .
thirty per cent of democratic voters do not believe Clinton honestly and trust@@ worthy is twice as many say about S@@ anders ( 15 per cent ) , but 27 percent do not have any opinion on it .
democratic voters of the previous elections also see Clinton , S@@ anders and bent in accordance with their views .
with all these measurements , about a quarter of democratic voters no opinion has changed .
since questions regarding Hill@@ ary Clinton , use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server for the term as a foreign mini@@ ster@@ or , most of the Democratic voters of the former elections are pleased with their statement of the matter and say that their opinion has not been affected .
but it is a different story in the American public .
half of the Americans is now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about a third is satisfied .
the public opinion about this was in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy did not have an effect on their overall opinion of Clinton , although 36 per cent said that their opinion was still deteri@@ or@@ ated .
it is mainly Republi@@ can , more than six of 10 that say that their views have become worse from Clinton .
although Clinton is regarded as honest and trust@@ worthy of the voters of their party in a total : only 32 percent do they see it being honest and trust@@ worthy , eight per cent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of those entitled to vote do not hold them for honest and trusted person .
at the same time , 55 percent of the eligible voters can also see tru@@ mp than not honest and not trust@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tru@@ mp however receive good notes on guidance .
of the six tested candidates , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush are best driven by honesty .
a majority are quite different from being honest , but like Car@@ son , many don &apos;t think of it .
the error ratio for the sample test of 3@@ 51 Democratic constitu@@ ents at the pre @-@ elections is 6 pp .
Ben Car@@ son shifts near Donald Tru@@ mp
Ben Car@@ son is one of the latest survey of CB@@ S News / New York Times den@@ sely behind Donald Tru@@ mp
in the meantime , on the two candidates , half of the support of the voters appeared in the new pol@@ l , and others lose dramatically .
Republi@@ can elec@@ tors support land@@ mines in large numbers . the support grows by 23 % in the last CB@@ S survey , which was conducted before Fox News debate last month , by 27 % in survey on Tuesday .
but Car@@ son fell by 6 % in the same period from 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son at demo@@ graphic groups arrives well in demo@@ graphic groups and trust in@@ mp under republi@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ der , is be@@ aten with Wis@@ cons@@ ins Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , which is best enjoyed by 10 % support in the last month .
the former Florida Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush , the former Gover@@ nor of Ark@@ ans@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio are located 6 % on the third place .
the error @-@ based in the sample of 3@@ 76 people from Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C pol@@ l , which was published last week shows that Car@@ son enters into the Surv@@ eys - he land at 19 % supporting the re@@ public@@ ans , behind the chest with 32 % support .
the recent survey of ABC News / Washington Post was also clear from Car@@ son .
with a view of one in the last week of rising Car@@ son , Tru@@ mp found some side stra@@ in@@ ers for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ olog@@ ised to question Tru@@ mp@@ s faith in question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said In@@ mp on Saturday last Saturday during a term show in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean sea is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even if peak values are measured only in the distance , for bathing , a trip to the Mediterranean sea , in order to still find warm water .
a bath in north or Baltic sea is likely to be a rather short pleasure with a maximum of 17 degrees .
some of them goes no more into the sea : 18 degrees , the water in the north and Baltic Sea of this week , does not share the German weather service ( D@@ W@@ D ) .
on the other hand , bad@@ ges continues to offer the Mediterranean : to the east it is even down to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic sea there are in the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood led by the death of a Bar@@ uch College @-@ P@@ rel@@ ing
almost two years after a student during a lay@@ ered ritual in a student contact in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , mines filed against five people .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ PSI fr@@ at@@ ross : Michael &quot; Den@@ g during a introductory ritual in September 2013 brutal and completed its transport to the hospital , leading to his death , shared the police with .
officials said that he had been bur@@ dened with connected eyes with a 30 @-@ pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly attacks , while he tried to go over a frozen field in a destination .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about head@@ ache , then he fell in mind .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ PSI fr@@ at@@ ernity did not cry out the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g power@@ less and waited an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
but they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , his symptoms were goo@@ gling and Andy Men@@ g , to contact the national president of the Brotherhood , to seek advice , Mr. Michael Wagner said at a press conference .
&quot; at this point the members , U@@ ten@@ utensils began to hide and put the welfare of the Brotherhood , basically by Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Mr. Chief Wagner .
he could not revi@@ ve again , and he died in the next morning to his wounds .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy , Den@@ g repeatedly added with bl@@ unt force of injury to head , trunk and th@@ igh@@ s .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the Shi@@ ps of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies since 1970 each year to the Shi@@ ps , &quot; Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer , who represents the D@@ eng@@ s family , in an explanation .
bro@@ ther@@ hoods and its members must be held accountable , and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended an accus@@ ation because of the murder of the third Gra@@ des for the first five members .
two @-@ thirty members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are charged also on forced attack and de@@ crimin@@ als of a criminal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we not only want to make the involved people responsible but if there is an organization that - officially or in@@ official - this has been perf@@ ected , so we will also hold this to account , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bar@@ uch College has forbidden the Brotherhood , and the National Brotherhood has rev@@ oked its affili@@ ation to the local group .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
a sign @-@ mining is coming , and the land@@ se goes in re@@ plen@@ ish , ren@@ amed for bonds will rise , and the economy is gli@@ ding into a recession .
we know this .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will take and how long it will stop .
particularly the history of the economy provides only little guidance to the procedure .
a recession came within only 11 months after the first savings rate and lasted all 86 months .
the aggression of the Federal Reserve at the lifting of interest rates is often , though not always , a factor in how the economy and the financial investments react .
therefore , representatives of the US bank has so much stressed that investors should not concentrate on when they start raising interest rates , but rather on the period that is needed for norm@@ alization .
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end , the market participants could determine that the whole excitement could possibly be exagger@@ ated because of a provision .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cheap Money &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast we expect not the gradual return of U.S. interest to normal high@@ s but still at low level , in order to se@@ ism@@ an shock , which many seem to fear .
however , this does not mean that there will be no effect .
here is a set of historical trends based look on how some areas of the economy could respond :
as the market has seen in the last month , the anticip@@ ation of cre@@ do things can make things for a while vol@@ ati@@ le .
once the increase occurs , the influence is not so dramatically .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is apparently a tendency that assets deri@@ ves from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank an@@ alysts in a recent study on what is happening after landing of the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more specifically , the market has been more intense over the past 35 years - roughly 14 per cent - on the way to the sign @-@ landing , fairly flat in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a current analysis , the Bob Dol@@ l , chef system @-@ Str@@ ate@@ ge with Nu@@ je@@ Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
Deutsche Bank said that the effect on stock tend to occur later in the increases cycle and the return will start to decrease .
attempts are a fact of economic life , but fr@@ ing@@ ero@@ on promote them often .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions which did not exist before and that could speed up a recession .
extremely remarkable is that the gross domestic product is near his lowest point in a ten@@ dering of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank stood at 118 percent since 1950 only twice the nominal GDP of 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 was at 3.4 per cent , just a few expect that this will last but expecting the third quarter according to Atlanta F@@ ed only 1.5 percent .
in such an un@@ question@@ able economic setting , we could be risky and throw the question , &quot; if it is different this time , &quot; the Deutsche Bank said .
market participants took root the whole year on a sign @-@ up of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in that week which ends on Thursday .
while many Str@@ ate@@ urs and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could boost an increase in this meeting , the f@@ ut@@ ures trading gives only an probability of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study all the increases cycles from 1950 to today in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP has taken place and before rec@@ itation of recovery began very quickly after the beginning of recovery &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest that the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and these were 74 months until now .
the fixed income was also vol@@ ati@@ le , since the market taking advantage of a provision , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect in bonds faster is faster than with stocks .
when bonds , the ren@@ ders appear to change the direction as soon as the first increase / lowering is carried out in the cycle .
at the conclusion of the increases cycle , the bond dates drop immediately , the Deutsche Bank said .
the strateg@@ ist of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase in the interest rates will lead to the fact that the gap between longer and shorter bonds will bring closer together and lead to a fl@@ ashing of the curve .
high @-@ precision bonds often bring better earnings in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come analy@@ st at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis .
what &apos;s interesting , Jones doesn &apos;t mean that the markets have already been adapted to F@@ ed Strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation there are some indications that the market has adapted to more stringent monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
short term interest has risen , the income statement is increased , cre@@ dit@@ ch have increased and the vol@@ ati@@ lity has risen , all the characteristics of the market , when the F@@ ed has exac@@ erb@@ ated its strategy .
companies will benefit in large and international companies that benefit most of their business operations in the US , benefit from interest rates and make local products more attractive .
multi @-@ multination@@ als with high debt will be worse , as a rising dollar will make their products on the global market more expensive and so the financing of their debts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares to react exce@@ ed@@ ingly positive after three months , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Gold man Sach@@ s in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet have exceeded the company balance sheet after each of the audit authorities in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 at the average by 5 percent .
companies with high capital ren@@ ders as well as low vol@@ ati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their counterparts with low quality for an average of 4 ( percent@@ ages ) and 3 ( percent@@ ages ) .
debt will become a big problem .
companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will lose the most , he said gold .
consumers can also profit from rising dollars outside of pure share price .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sav@@ ings could see profits by higher yields , even if experts of different opinions are how quickly this will take place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says Board member Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the conserv@@ atives member of the Parliament critici@@ zed the transmitter because of its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cur@@ v@@ ature &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly distingu@@ ish@@ able from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also zi@@ ed on the BBC Music Awards and said that she was just The Br@@ its im@@ i@@ cked
parliament @-@ colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins handle the shipment of The Voice and said that this is not very original .
BBC Radio 3 &quot; turns itself &quot; to Classic FM , claims a leader of parliam@@ ent@@ arians and ex@@ changing new pressure on the transm@@ itters to prove that he does something what the private sender doesn &apos;t do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the conserv@@ atives MP Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC @-@ raid , that the publicly @-@ legal radi@@ os@@ sal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dis@@ dum@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and is increasingly no longer distinguished by its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dro@@ wn the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to render to Classic FM &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also zi@@ pped to the BBC Music Awards , which started in December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year seem to be The Br@@ its just under another name .
so , if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneous examples where you actually only know what already is on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham .
BBC @-@ Director tor proved the alleg@@ ations back and argued that BBC Radio 3 goes far ahead of its commercial competition when it comes to live music and education to the public .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I will nowhere else learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music which is truly un@@ matched .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment from Radio 3 to find new music and to give new works on behalf , I also really think of importance &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey that tough@@ er to get involved in getting the audience involved as it did in the past because the British are less informed of classical music .
radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production , which won during the hearing in the committee on the choice of culture , media and sports for the use of fire , the commercial ri@@ vals on the feet .
the T@@ ory @-@ MP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins handle The Voice on - the musical talents Show of the BBC , who bought from the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa@@ h Media for valued cost of 22 million £ .
do you see why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not especially distinctive ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge &quot; was produced in a special BBC @-@ way . &quot;
he added that he is hoping that the company can take a hit from our in @-@ house barn , &quot; when the next time it was a entertainment track .
however , it refused to exclude the order of additional rows of The Voice in the future or to render money of ag@@ it@@ ators for other sub@@ types of consumer .
net sales climbed in August at slow and black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 there were seven percent increase in online selling .
in the last month the lowest result was since the beginning of the records in 2000 .
online sales increased three years ago through the use of phones for shopping
experts believe that black Friday has slow@@ down on Friday in November
for over a decade , the Virtual Shopping has bo@@ oted and many of the main shopping streets in Britain have turned into violin .
yet experts say that there are now signs that the online changes will be stag@@ nating after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the overall issue for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say that there are signs that online purchases st@@ agn@@ ant after new figures showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , this has evolved over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , publisher of the IM@@ R@@ G approach to the Guardian .
he explained that online sales increased three years ago , as a purchaser , with their phones purchases .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do so in different environments , for example at home on the sofa .
but now that one comm@@ utes itself , and we will perhaps experience that growth dimin@@ ishes .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon that was imported from America is cited as one reason for the subsequent ess@@ ays .
experts believe that buyers keep their purchases on this event , which will take place on the last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers for their computers to make their bar@@ gain , and some traders @-@ websites rus@@ hed .
experts believe that Black Friday , on whom the buyers would fight for bar@@ gains , buyers that could hold buyers from doing shopping .
a study of the British Retail Con@@ sortium found that by 5 £ spending a little over 1 £ online was spent .
with some products such as television and washing machines , more than one third of purchases can now be made via Web @-@ shops .
at the same time , it bu@@ ys more than a quarter of people clothing and shoes online instead of the fashion designers in the cities .

today king Sal@@ man , the Bin @-@ Laden @-@ group would not have been able to ste@@ al the arm of this crane , when he was not used .
a Arabic version of the decre@@ e which was published by the State of Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin @-@ Laden group was responsible for the collapse .

B &amp; Q boss predic@@ ts the time for the cheap Eastern European crafts@@ man
British are increasingly showing arti@@ sans , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of qualified arti@@ sans in Eastern Europe has a rise behind
that leads to that 200 more scre@@ w@@ fix stores that are aimed at tra@@ des@@ men
at the same time , King@@ f@@ isher 60 B &amp; Q sales offices are close
from Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chef correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is alleged that British put its h@@ amm@@ ers and brush in favor of the use of qualified Eastern European craftsmen who perform work in their home
if you are sk@@ ill@@ ful with a hammer or a brush to tackle walls , you belong to a minority .
because British are increasingly showing arti@@ sans in order to conduct home@@ work jobs in their homes so the chief of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new manager of King@@ f@@ isher who owns the building markets chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe , offer services to low prices may be obsol@@ ete .
therefore , King@@ f@@ isher will open King@@ f@@ isher , 200 other scre@@ w@@ fix stores to open to the tra@@ des@@ men and 60 sales points of B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q @-@ shops , because eight out of ten buying decisions are taken in the shop by women .
in the moment l@@ ull with the employees the men .
she said it was necessary to face the growing demo@@ graphic trends that have more female single households , which make more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it is still working a majority of men in our stores .
we need to move this more towards a balance .
generally , half of our customers are made up of women with 80 percent of their choices on the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , which is one of just five women at the top of a British at FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index @-@ listed companies , has also stru@@ sted its top teams to reflect a equal number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ f@@ isher is almost the only company that occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and financial status .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ f@@ isher tra@@ ded a decline at the half @-@ year @-@ profit and the attempts after the group got the costs for the closing of the shops .
because of the trends King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q will open up 200 new stores .
function@@ aries of A@@ I / DO@@ B due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity on trial
on Wednesday two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball decision maker A@@ I / DO@@ B must be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and disp@@ ens@@ ation of the Austrian volleyball field .
the accused did not guilty .
one of them was also charged with official abuse .
on this accus@@ ation he had been fully accepted in May .
the present process has been ad@@ jour@@ ned .
according to Ober@@ sta@@ ats@@ an@@ walt Robert Ri@@ ffel had cryst@@ alli@@ zed himself in the preliminary investigation that the accused could use funds from accounts for the years 2006 to 2011 . they were allowed to disp@@ ose it in their functions , for private purposes .
the damage is handled with some 400@@ ,000 Euros .
the sports functions are also charged for financial statements .
this fact differs the chairman of the closing movement , Re@@ chter@@ in Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
this shall be negotiated at a later date .
the a@@ throw of the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity made the defense in no time had emerged as an asset in any time .
the sports patient had only charged re@@ allow@@ ance and the sports club , for whom they had invested heavily from 1982 to 2011 and in whom they had invested a lot of time and money , from the debts brought out in 2001 about 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ illing ( rd . 4@@ 4,000 Euro ) .
&quot; back then we were before the situation : do we continue to or block the club , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the def@@ endants , at the Br@@ ot@@ chief of the audi@@ tor of the financial process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he then decided to take this task with his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ endants .
with all risks .
&quot; we have prescribed money , our life insurance is kept as security in the bank , &quot; he said in the deadline .
it may be agreed with the club : you can manage the money freely , there must be only no debts .
furthermore , in the case of similar financial success , the payout of allow@@ ance was postponed until 1991 .
therefore , one portion of the allow@@ ance was only for years later , namely from 2003 , when a plus was paid to the account .
therefore , l@@ ump and not all @-@ form@@ work , and not detail in detail , the former ob@@ mann explained the proceedings .
the accounts and text@@ books put together the two def@@ endants in common , said the second def@@ endant .
why the withdrawal has not been detailed to the association in detail , asked the set @-@ in .
the society was not interested in detail for the financial management , important is only the debt of debt , so the answer .
as in 2011 against the an interdisciplinary investigations on the term of ministers , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the official account .
these were rep@@ lied , the def@@ endants were .
this securities account ran for the name of the second def@@ endants and was not aware of the association according to its statement .
&quot; why ? , &quot; wanted to know the Ju@@ dge in .
after that the respon@@ dent had no answer for a long time .
then he said he was , he believed that this was the best for the association .
if something had happened to him , nobody would have knew anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor has put in the room .
the co @-@ def@@ endant was informed , he justified the function@@ aries .
this transfer was formulated as &quot; damages . &quot;
why contam@@ in@@ dem@@ nity ? , wanted to know mo@@ ors and prosec@@ utor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the contrary , the first def@@ endant was not agree with this wording as the association was never created a damage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the attorney says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with whom you are all out of the hook . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a judicial representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , the function@@ aries said he never got a pen@@ ny of content , he is currently calcul@@ ating o@@ dom@@ eter and di@@ ets .
as a di@@ eting , he charged 1,000 Euro per month , but the actual effort was much higher , he added .
exact documents for the early years could not assign the def@@ endants .
these were after a commission where everything was judged as accurate , no longer maintained , declared it .
Kilom@@ eters also had covered the second def@@ endant .
all Beh@@ aus@@ ungen are available in cash , but in addition he had to drive from his home @-@ place international market to the bank to B@@ lei@@ burg , he explained in his statement .
the main proceedings will be continued on September 23 with the survey of witnesses .

as part of its restructuring process , the US technology company plans to reduce emissions from 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its company &apos;s business .
in this way , costs of EUR 2.7 billion ( 2.3 billion ) are intended to be saved , divided the company on Tuesday with .
the step will lead to a special load of around 2.7 billion dollars , which will drop from the fourth quarter .
the reduction of 5@@ 5,000 jobs have not yet been completed over the past three years .

that other countries of air strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria are 61 percent positive .
24 percent are against them to interven@@ e in conflicts .

R@@ ös@@ ch : non@@ violence against Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police took place on the Serbian border with R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and water@@ light against several hundreds of launched refugees .
Eurozone correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has experienced the non @-@ violence at the limit control point .
he reported by phone :
a group of refugees erup@@ ted the border .
behind it had a police line and behind the police stood a water@@ light ready .
40 to 50 refugees started with stones , sticks and plastic bottles after the officials .
the officials lasted first without any pe@@ pper spray .
afterwards the police used Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
a lot of Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
thereby the group was dissolved .
the refugees have withdrawn now somewhat .
a pregnant woman and obviously the last woman was carried away from the zone .
children that saw the l@@ ati@@ eng@@ as , cried out .
other refugees mig@@ rated together and suffered under breathing difficulties .
the Pres@@ ent@@ pre@@ cher of the Serbian police suffered injuries by the use of l@@ ac@@ eng@@ as and pe@@ pper spray .
time for decision on interest rates for the US bank
the world ob@@ serves , when the US staff arrived on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest rates are raised or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists were asked by Re@@ uters that a little more than half , the last week of view was that the F@@ ed will do this now , now thinks that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and the interest rates will hold on the current level of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the re@@ ed interest on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation in which a large central bank could possibly leave the zero area and starts a process of norm@@ alization of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bi@@ de , leading MBA at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the U.S. economy is on a relatively good performance , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars will be added to the balance sheet and generate just low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the lesser degree of outlook on global circumstances .
she has warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs point out that the chances of taking such a step are good .
the decision should be announced at 20.00 hrs CET on Thursday
death at the Delta State University left a sentence
after the shot and killing of his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he later on the day his colleagues killed and sle@@ w - Sh@@ annon was given a note to say that they were &quot; sorry , &quot; with the first murder and he wanted , &quot; he could not make it happen , &quot; given authorities on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Mississippi , said that he &apos;s Lec@@ turer in geography and socio @-@ scientific education at the Delta State University , called emergency number against 10 : 00 am Monday morning
and he said , he was shot on someone , and someone killed .
he told the people of the emergency central that the police officers must send his home to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I created my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the house was , who will &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but probably be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the c@@ aller after his name , but he did not give him .
he does not present any explanation for his shots .
as the police entered the scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 that said , &quot; I am sorry , I wanted it und@@ one .
I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
after writing the records , 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor for History , killed before he finally took his own life on Monday night when polic@@ eman wrapped him .
University president William La@@ For@@ ge said he did not know anything about a conflict between himself and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs launch . &quot;
despite reports on Monday , it was alleged that pr@@ enti@@ ss also had a relationship with Schmidt , told authorities on Tuesday that they don &apos;t give &quot; any information , no evidence of &quot; tri@@ angular relation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; pr@@ enti@@ ss has been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ un@@ ss &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ ste@@ en , who said they were about seven years married as a &quot; &quot; &quot; good human &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two have been divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
o &apos;@@ Or@@ en said he and pr@@ enti@@ ss have had a daughter who &apos;s 19 and had destroyed &quot; on the ground . &quot;
he said that pr@@ enti@@ ss their daughter were &quot; absolute best friends . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to the statement of L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les which was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pre@@ t@@ ss , who had a dog called Light@@ ning , who has received him for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; said Know@@ les
the police said , I represented relatives at a certain moment in the Monday to say to them , &quot; he is not going into prison . &quot;
when polic@@ emen him on the Highway 1 at Green@@ ville later in that night , his car drove to the side , fled by foot , ran into the woods and sle@@ w himself with a shot .
he received a doctoral degree in the Spring of 2015 from the Delta State University for a doctoral degree as it &apos;s clever to appear on the University &apos;s website .
stars that have lost their happiness
the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stress@@ ful years .

all this certainly calls for its toll .
Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa to rebuild the Group
the Lufthansa is planning a large group of companies .

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can not play months for double @-@ size
Luke Sha@@ w suffered for the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven , a double frac@@ ture of his right leg .
while this was imp@@ ending his left defense def@@ ender and won him for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al won &apos;t hope that Sha@@ w may play again this season .
the injury was caused by a rel@@ ent@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ ctor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w was in the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the pitch and needed oxygen before he was brought to hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double an@@ einf@@ ra@@ y and is in the hospital . &quot;
he will move tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then surgery in Manchester .
it is terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United which has very difficult and then played fantastic , and then this happens .
in the locker room he had an oxygen masks .
he wept .
I am not a physician , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then the six months and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Moreno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the im@@ position of an El@@ f@@ meter .
Nicola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbitr@@ ator , has not fin@@ alized the Mis@@ o .
van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian refer@@ ee had been wrong .
you can judge for yourself when I say that a mo@@ le and a red card was due .
it was a very worse attack with both legs .
a T@@ we@@ et on Sha@@ ws account stated : &quot; I thank you all for your news . words can not describe how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I will come back more again . &quot;
related to : Manchester United suff@@ ers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w in the defeat of the PS@@ V
the England defen@@ ders has an additional incentive with the European Championship in France to recover from the end of June .
Phillip Co@@ cu , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very narrow breach . &quot;
if a player leaves this kind of injury the place are all very sad over it .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Moreno suffered a near break , as Mexico played against Van Rompuy as the Netherlands team at the World Cup 2014 .
&quot; he is very difficult , because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent and if you then hear that it is a very bad injury , this is not good , &quot; said Co@@ cu .
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was moving in a different direction , so it looked , as if he had touched him , but I could not see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Moreno : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be .
I feel very bad there . I am sorry .
the PS@@ V @-@ player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to hospital - after a scar@@ f by Chris Sm@@ alling .
certainly David Cameron knows better The Lor@@ ax ?
it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not be long before you get it almost nowhere .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a supplier of child care systems , his favorite children &apos;s book decided to call itself the prime minister for The Lor@@ ax , the 1971 published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult election , he writes Cameron in a message on the website of the company Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative , and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I would like to read my children , as it seems to always have an image or message that we &apos;ve missed so far . &quot;
all beautiful and good , except that the subsequent paragraph , in which Cameron alle@@ ge@@ dly describes the plot of the book , instead re@@ inv@@ ent a summar@@ ise of the film version of 2012 which added new characters and details to extend the fairly short original text .
&quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a good , a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of Au@@ dre@@ y , met her desire to see a real tree , she reads . a love interests was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name The@@ odor Bill@@ uss ho@@ ho@@ ver and the 1991 died , but completely unknown .
as though that would not be susp@@ icious enough : the text presented by Cameron speaking is partly like the summary of the Lor@@ ax film , which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and thus starts : &quot; in the w@@ alled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he seems to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely to Cameron familiar with the act of the book so little . here is an un@@ named boy , like the local environment by the monetary gre@@ ax , car@@ ot@@ gi@@ ous beings , &quot; that is speaking on the names of the trees , &quot; which is v@@ aged in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a volunteer who , The Lor@@ ax has not read a little for 20 times in a child .
a Down@@ ing Street Spe@@ ak said that the text was probably based on Cam@@ er@@ ons &apos;s elec@@ torate .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text of Cam@@ er@@ ons employees has been delivered , but gave no further immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly endangered by the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still hard
to b@@ ump in Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you chose the Ka@@ der , the England for the tour , there is a repetition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series of defeat not on my map .
I would not close a down@@ side .
A@@ sc@@ air C@@ ooks page is possibly less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin player in the Batt@@ ing installation , and the shared spirit is strong ; they will not wear s@@ cars from 2012 , just a you@@ thful positive attitude .
with the ball is developing Mo@@ een Ali as Spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if it represents an unknown size on the test level , is an option for the attack .
in this message , Adam Ly@@ th takes off from the England @-@ test cad@@ res and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to permit Adam Ly@@ th is of course for me as his boss in Yor@@ k@@ shire , difficult to analyze .
at the seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that critics are aimed at results .
there were no question mark with Joe R@@ oot , for example , and this led to the nom@@ ination , since - and I said that - players are their own best selection .
a long time ago we had extended the run of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own destiny .
if he hopefully succ@@ es@@ sively for@@ ge other releases for Yor@@ k@@ shire , there is another chance .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his post@@ ure , even if he did not bring so good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team @-@ man .
the question , as much time a test @-@ provo@@ ke receives to put his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - , while Nick Comp@@ ton was nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to do home and sing .
the only accus@@ ation that one can rise , was that England was first Jonathan for Jonathan in the Caribbean - when Ly@@ th was in maximum - but this lost opportunity is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a g@@ man that I highly regard .
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ pp@@ et@@ aker , which we saw in Yor@@ k@@ shire early in that season when he took place 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge Square that met us very much .
it must be at least the same chances as the person received before him , but this depends of course on the team position in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to leave Mo@@ een next to Cook , which would perform an extra @-@ Spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and four qu@@ icks were received , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a whi@@ man can not beat out there , and this left @-@ handed has already shown that he is a devil @-@ cur@@ ator of cri@@ cket players .
Mo@@ een has not finished his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for them and there is no big difference .
my former team @-@ mate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests in the first drop before he stepped up as Open@@ er 2001 .
he made a three hundred stro@@ us immediately and didn &apos;t look back .
Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes into the Ka@@ der as back @-@ up Sp@@ inner and in my limited dealing with it he has impressed me as a young man .
people may see his statistics , on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it is a p@@ unt , but there is no large number of backup spi@@ ders who raise their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England has made a few clever additions at the trainers .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ a , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as consultants for the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nicest guys of the game that will bring an abundance of experiences , since it has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Col@@ ling@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful use to the Setup .
I always felt that he is created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as player or as coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes , new voices can bring fresh air in the locker room , even if the messages are in line with the before being mentioned .
Col@@ l@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ ok@@ es , is not used at the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot received a similar break against Australia and for my part I have no problem with it .
some will not agree , but co@@ aches and team members are not set up the schedule .
and you must remember that as with players will hin@@ ge their jobs from the results .
such decisions are made not easy to heart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bre@@ xit @-@ Camp ( Bre@@ xit = Equi@@ ties of Britain from the EU ) could gain some allow@@ ances if the economy was in a lau@@ d for 2017 until 2017
David Cam@@ er@@ ons un@@ reported re@@ development strategy to keep Britain in the EU will face more deeply in trouble with each day , even without the choice of the in@@ geni@@ ous Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it yes or no ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n at the leader of Labour or the Tu@@ c who was ra@@ ving for Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners have also their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at friend and recently she said that some member states , so deeply ent@@ an@@ gled into different crises , as the EU is now and not always from own guilt , of Britain even created agenda with split concessions and disturbing the changes that they mostly don &apos;t want to s@@ full .
in Brigh@@ ton , the Tu@@ c decided on its annual meeting that it does not like this when they end@@ anger social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance minister climbing on summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a picture of themselves before a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say they will gain alliances for reforms .
it is always about me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my European friend , who wants a meeting outside the EU in the interior of the EU T@@ ent - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ass did not leave us alone with France , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Berlin - and officials in some capitals had reached the point where they are no matter whether we stay or go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is a allies , but she has been in power for 10 years before it is bad for her , as it is for the exagger@@ ated long @-@ term , like Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and cab@@ bage ( 16 ) .
France François Hollande can look back on his re @-@ election or its replacement in 2017 .
he is also a bl@@ ass@@ ent force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left .
it is difficult to imagine that they will be a b@@ link to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ British to help prevent the sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ British to prevent their energy from the UK - something that they don &apos;t want to , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
therefore , perhaps some such ministers are even inten@@ tionally not helpful ann@@ ot@@ ations , quite in the SN@@ P style , during British referendum , 2017 to accelerate the Bre@@ xit process , thought my friend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ ego@@ ti@@ ation was bank@@ rupt , and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Britain has won &apos;t gain anything from the ren@@ ego@@ ti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans will know how dull the Fle@@ et Street can be at its cost and which EU scep@@ tics is the oligar@@ chy of press bar@@ one , as it did not have been inspired by Tony Ben@@ n inspired refer@@ en@@ du@@ ms in 1975 but not supported by our admission 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
they can be weak to Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ euro opportunity to make a name as an &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade @-@ ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s years .
with all his affection , Ed Mili@@ band knew his enemies .
this includes med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing sister , telephone @-@ h@@ acking foreigners and the p@@ seudo non @-@ countries that possess most of our large newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir made similar to her , but realized that when you sit with a hot Gor@@ illa in a cage , you get better ban@@ anas to di@@ stract him instead of getting to lunch and dinner .
in fact , the mili@@ tia was more Bla@@ i@@ ri@@ ans as Bla@@ ir itself , when he res@@ igned itself Cam@@ er@@ ons refer@@ en@@ du@@ ms@@ vor@@ tex , because Bla@@ ir had put the principle on the not adopted Constitution of the EU , which was then opposed by French and Dutch voters in 2005 that opened it an am@@ ining .
the press has never moved it to him .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me back on Monday to Westminster , a friendly club on the back - I told him that he has no time to waste more for me - seems to be in danger , N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cott mur@@ der@@ y mur@@ der@@ ous strategy of 80 &apos;s years , a mistake at that time and today .
it can take , but he has to develop a coher@@ ent strategy in order to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ sofa has left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ ns official position to Europe is - I express it kind of time - in development .
he says that we should remain in a reform@@ ist EU .
now , most people outside the U@@ ki@@ ops traditional bl@@ amed tendency and the wild@@ est skir@@ ts of go@@ ys Klein @-@ English can probably everyone say yes to this .
it is what Help &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no B@@ enn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and television this week said when the sc@@ outs of him fought in him , did not admit that Cor@@ by@@ ns appointment of the prov@@ oked John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell as a sk@@ inn@@ aker had a bad idea .
it reminded me of the sev@@ enty years , when his old father committed himself to his labor @-@ loyal to his Labour cabinet without going too far and lose his cabinet @-@ job .
Hil@@ ar@@ dy &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
but to fight , in order to stay &quot; under all circumstances - B@@ enn@@ ese - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , &quot; what J@@ C re@@ gu@@ ed his comrades and vote after all the reports on their monasteries on Monday night .
whatever the touching Bot@@ t@@ om image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to impress upon that he even touched me - News @-@ discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of Social Media , a brood @-@ centre of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
it is right to give Cameron a free card for Europe that allows him to hold Lab@@ ours support in the referendum for self @-@ granted , like Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said .
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly thinks that way .
but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ bi@@ ns fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ties with EU membership - in accordance with its B@@ enn@@ ite Bel@@ ag@@ ro @-@ Economy , its anti @-@ capital@@ istic past - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left dis@@ sid@@ ents , for which the nar@@ c@@ acies of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with its ambig@@ u@@ ties to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find in all a sense of their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin wast@@ ing political capital - they also have mis@@ sive voters - to make concessions to the British if this can be meaning@@ less ?
the U.S. has already been rather disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , what I was reminded at the start on Monday of something that British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum .
experts critici@@ zing report from Public Health Great Britain on e @-@ cigarettes
claims of a state @-@ financed agency that e @-@ cigarettes are less detri@@ mental than smoking was created from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , connect the Lanc@@ et by demonstrating the way that the Public Health Great Britain ( p@@ hic ) critici@@ zed in their report on e @-@ cigarettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; p@@ hic published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Grund@@ ner &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yet some researchers have questioned the res@@ ili@@ ence of the data and are directed to the connections between several experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a director in the medical journal Lanc@@ et published last month , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extremely wind@@ y basis , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on which p@@ hic its most important conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two more researchers write in BM@@ J and have asked if the declarations are based on stone or sand . &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Physi@@ ology at University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the certificate &apos;s certificate . &quot;
they said that the public anticip@@ ates that the statement of origin is that &quot; the present best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes is about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of indul@@ ging and modelling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 persons who were conven@@ ed to build a model for a multiple criteria decision ( multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria Decision Analysis - M@@ C@@ DA ) to lead their opinions on the damage of various nicotine @-@ containing products to a synthesis . the results of the meeting were summarized in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro Swiss Health , whose Managing Director ever won by British American Tob@@ acco Products ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also wrote the testimonials of BA@@ T for Public Health in a Sustainability Report , told her .
one of the 12 participants in the meeting agreed to receive funding from an e @-@ cigarettes @-@ maker but not funding he should have received for reports previously from the tobacco company Philip Morris International .
the reasons for selecting the members of the committee will not be supplied , but several well @-@ known e @-@ cigarettes are sold , some of which also indicate a variety of industries in the paper .
some other participants in this session are not known for their know @-@ how in the tobacco control .
at the meeting also the tobacco leadership was attended by p@@ hic .
the research work of the group &quot; suggests that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence of &quot; hard evidence of most products in most criteria , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well .
however , none of these links or restrictions are discussed in the p@@ hic record .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said the claims of phe that &quot; there is so far no evidence that e @-@ cigarettes was a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers .
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , director of health and well @-@ being at p@@ hic , said that the alleg@@ ations of BM@@ J was already re@@ acted before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ kers dies in his addiction .
all evidence suggest that the health risks of e @-@ cigarettes is low compared to that , but we will continue to study the long @-@ term impact .
p@@ hic record has the unique obligation to inform the public about what evidence shows and what not , especially when there are so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco .
nearly 8@@ ,000 people are killed on a disease with respect to smoking , and smoking is the National Health system two billion £ per year .
by clear proof of current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of harm that will be caused by smoking , we fulfill our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give East@@ En@@ ders , says former Chief of Channel 4
the former chair of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said the BBC should stop to send programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broad@@ casting fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK channels .
he critici@@ zed the BBC that they publicly see publicly legal programs which are likely to be seen from a smaller audience , to place in harsh controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and from mu@@ ters like BB@@ C@@ 4 .
after the BBC @-@ Director , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , said Johnson said that he tried to get in contact with Channel 4 for six years at his time with Channel 4 .
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs would be commissioned or sends , who were also clearly shown by no sub@@ str@@ ated Rival , &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus @-@ Communication Committee within the framework of his investigation about the future of the BBC .
if you want to keep the broad@@ casting fee , which I consider medium or long @-@ term not for a good idea , one should at least make production at least on programs , others do not make it or order .
they send The Voice in a prime time window because they want to achieve as much possible support for their future .
the idea that otherwise no one would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridic@@ ulous , it is natural nonsense .
Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive taxes is financed which could also be financed without subsidies .
the Voice is such a program , East@@ er@@ ders is another , given off both original production .
honestly , other channels would give their right arm for it .
I comp@@ ose to see how this is to be public @-@ legal TV .
I don &apos;t believe that this would reduce the BBC ever .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson , a entrepren@@ eur for series , channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is to blame for the hunt for reviews &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the ambitions of the people who work there and because they believe this is the best way to secure long term support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his comments on the BBC most popular ship@@ ments give that again what the former head of Sky , Tony &apos;s , in his qu@@ ir@@ t lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC shows were supposed to sell as East@@ er@@ ders .
Johnson said that the rather publicly @-@ legal ni@@ cal programs should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , but they do not measure their tasks , and they can argue if they have created on their seem@@ ing missions to the justification of 4 billion £ of broad@@ casting , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these ob@@ sc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them into a window in which no one ever wanted to see .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the broad@@ casting , Johnson said the committee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can obtain the best value from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , you think all , that one receives a great value for 150 £ per year here , but for people , which for the 150 £ a lot of money is , asking me if that &apos;s true , because they do not consume much from the BBC .
the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 @-@ boss David El@@ stein , who also said before the Committee on Tuesday , urged that the BBC has to check their matur@@ ation mission , &quot; to inform , form and entertain . &quot;
he said , little by the BBC @-@ production , would now be officially categorized as education - he said that it is 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and it should take an example on public @-@ related television channels in Australia and Canada , and will change this in &quot; inform , clarify and chat . &quot;
on the question of partnerships said El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television are shown , and with the commercial broad@@ band alliances to make everything online available .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ und@@ &apos; can control brain cells through noise control
the video shows how the ne@@ mato@@ des change the direction in the moment in which they are broad@@ cast@@ ed with sound impulses .
scientists have bre@@ d wor@@ ms with gene@@ tically modified nervous systems , controlled by dis@@ armament of sound @-@ waves .
the tiny Nem@@ ato@@ ids change the direction in the moment they are associated with Klang@@ impulses , which for the human hearing at high frequencies have to be heard .
the impulses work through the switching of mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells that are alter@@ nat@@ ely modified to wear the membrane channels that are responding to ultras@@ ound waves .
further to this topic : researchers reading and writing brain activity with light
the researchers said that wor@@ ms demonstrated the power of a new procedure called Son@@ o@@ bot with which ultras@@ ound can be used to activate a range of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
S@@ re@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the depths of the brain , the electric stim@@ uli in the brain of people for the treatment of Park@@ inson &apos;s disease .
thread typically do not react to ultras@@ ound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani set out that they did it if they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ cosmic bub@@ bles .
the bub@@ bles , he found out , reinforce the ultras@@ ound waves , which will then penetrate the wor@@ ms .
the increased ultras@@ ound cam@@ shafts act on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ I@@ on@@ en@@ kan@@ als and are found in the membran@@ es of some of the wor@@ sen@@ als .
the noise @-@ waves make the opening of these I@@ on@@ al channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , so a report Nature Communications .
in order to create ultras@@ ound @-@ controlled Nem@@ at@@ ani , Chal@@ as@@ ani changed the wor@@ ms that some of their mo@@ on@@ eur@@ ons carry over TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ I@@ on@@ en@@ kan@@ ers .
when using ultras@@ ound on the changing creatures , the noise @-@ waves are reinforced by micro@@ algae and transmitted to the wor@@ ms where they turn the changed mo@@ on@@ ones .
the procedure has some similarities with op@@ to@@ us , a ground@@ breaking tool , which allows scientists to incorporate and turn the neur@@ ons with impulses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ ys could have some advantages over this technique .
unlike light that has to be revealed in an optical fiber of the desired place in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultras@@ ound waves can happen and can be sent to the brain from above on the sk@@ ull .
&quot; we believe that with gen@@ therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the assimil@@ ation human neur@@ ons temporarily pr@@ one to the ultras@@ ound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani .
other applications could be concentrated on muscle cells and ins@@ ulin production , he added .

V@@ C@@ CP @-@ Creative director Matt Le@@ ver was stun@@ ned by the silence that reigned around the advertisements for the arms exhibition - through a void of the Excel calendar - and thought : &quot; we give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot;
they played with the invention of a realistic spot@@ ting firm , but &quot; through the blu@@ ff@@ ing of bright colors and animation will remain stronger . &quot;
&quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness on the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair , &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nest@@ y .
what we need now is an intru@@ sion of the British government and the guarantee that tor@@ tured devices are not being illeg@@ ally tra@@ ded in front of our door@@ step .
perhaps the most creative art around the arms fair comes from the area within Excel , where the exhibitors are fantastic eu@@ ph@@ em@@ istic products .

eight golden rules for living in Stud@@ ents
eleven years ago I moved as self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old in a student dormitory , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral Rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the tense smile of those who I have anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , long @-@ bed complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be distill@@ ed in eight simple rules .
the ind@@ ent in student residence is enough from light @-@ wr@@ acking up to absolutely up@@ lifting .
it is temp@@ ting to beat ! people tell where you come , whether and where you have Sab@@ b@@ ite , where you do not love Sab@@ b@@ ite , because in the Ernst , guys , it is just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - Make your questions and show interest .
it distr@@ acts the conversation and helps you to figure out the people that you like in contrast to those with which you would not speak , even if your eyelashes were fire in fire and that fire extingu@@ ishers would be .
let people .
the rooms of people often turn into drinks and recipes , film @-@ night venues and local meeting places , but they are also the places where people inspire themselves and their under@@ wear .
doing this in : remember not to begin your university with a relationship
intro@@ sp@@ ection gained a cru@@ de treatment at the University .
your room should be a refuge , but many student homes make up a space @-@ to @-@ space @-@ b@@ um@@ mel culture that can lead friendly and socially and to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be the hell for someone who tries to rec@@ u@@ perate .
nothing in culture will allow you to say : &quot; I like you , and I will say that our friendship continues , but you have to go away so that I have used the energy that I have used for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a student of convi@@ vi@@ ality is exhausted - and send it an SMS instead of kno@@ ck .
A@@ pro@@ pos anchor : do it .
a guy in my student dor@@ ms had the idea that a failed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close by b@@ aking .
as you start at the peak of the back @-@ Man@@ ie , the clo@@ aca is att@@ acking the doors of men to get themselves with a plate full of Brow@@ nies , less strange when the welcome the 1950 @-@ he years &apos; welcome in the neighborhood , I made you a bit baked . so , and now please smile if I ask you a few personal questions . &quot;
offer home @-@ made delicious treats is a good way to make friend@@ ships .
your room@@ mates might feel obliged to maintain themselves and will associate your face with a delicious surprise in the end .
of course , this depends on whether you are an attractive b@@ aker .
bad mixed cl@@ umps from flour , sugar and fat leading to keep people asleep , if you anchor .
to ste@@ al food is a common crime in student homes .
of course , the cl@@ a@@ ws of chicken is a theft , but is it the taking of a drop of milk for your tea too ?
check this with the Mil@@ k owner .
the chances are good that they say to serve themselves , even if they cook in the inside .
if anyone missing your stuff is the annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to make a well @-@ balanced as my room@@ mate , who added their milk a r@@ ins@@ ing to pun@@ ish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make noise , which stops people from sleep or from work .
it is not just about being a decent person , but that you are in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb to the people sitting in the Glass House .
a girl in my hallway asked her neighbors , whether it turns them something , drum &amp; bass something le@@ qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning .
they react to this with even older music .
when she finally got up at 5 o &apos;clock , she allowed her neighbors to sleep two hours before she lo@@ wered her own music and shut her door and ended up for her three @-@ hour test .
would it not be romantic if your future spouse would have to move into the same dor@@ m residence ?
it is the other way round , it would not be too deep embarrass@@ ed for your future wife , to sit down to her , to separate yourself and then experience it every day and maybe experience how they all went closer together with their shared friends ?
of course , the heart goes its own ways - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future colleague . in this way , try to talk a little reason at least .
in the exciting moment , in which you notice that someone has his key in his not locked room , the border between a Ul@@ k and Bul@@ lying as it seems .
a good track is fun , but it only takes moments to bo@@ omer@@ ang until he is bo@@ omer@@ ang .
give thanks to a valuable and am@@ using lesson about security - but never forget someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
close your door , and place their keys in a glass of water , which you put in the freezer - but stap@@ ling your possessions on the ceiling do not have more than twice .
terr@@ aced houses for refugees , single @-@ pulling , od@@ ing@@ se@@ ties
the real estate sub @-@ contractors Markus G@@ ild@@ ner builds in the Central fran@@ con@@ ian tri@@ logy terr@@ aced houses for people who do not have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so , approximately for refugees - but also as a signal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need dor@@ sal space , but also the wal@@ k@@ able mother and the ger@@ ear@@ ners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I show how you can even build cheap and well @-@ priced , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees will push onto the market .
the entrepreneurs Markus G@@ ild@@ ner believes how quickly cheaper could be created : it builds on a project of terr@@ aced houses for refugees .
Mr. G@@ ild@@ ner , many refugees will push over to the market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : mass accommodation in containers or rotation has no sustainability .
for people remain a great part of it here .
given the refugees , we need to have enough living space in the coming decades .
a quite normal , three @-@ story holiday home is the solution .
G@@ ild@@ ner : a town house needs the least place .
it facilitates the integration .
this is different if people under@@ ing the people in bar@@ ing .
each of the six houses that are just built in the pilot project consists of three dwell@@ ings each for four asylum seekers .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it may be that many refugees will say , it is peace , I go back .
then the houses can easily be modified according to their needs .
how high are the costs ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : the price of 160 square meters of living space per building rises to 184 000 Euro , without property .
this is quite man@@ age@@ able .
the construction took six months .
this is appropriate .
do the construction rules manage their plans ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : building legally I have drawn my project correctly .
particularly complicated makes it always the dro@@ w@@ ning D@@ amo@@ kl@@ es@@ cher @-@ special structure and the S@@ quar@@ k Regulation .
cre@@ ep@@ y .
it is still under@@ min@@ ed who creates in a man@@ house of three apartments , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities is missing for the square .
and refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
how did the inhabitants react to their flo@@ or@@ age project ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : there were those who have thrown out to create their lux@@ uries for asylum seekers .
what is definitely not true .
but do not tigh@@ test you in terms of competitive housing ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : true is it : in the last five years we have a construction boom in Germany , but built of luxury apartments , which can hardly afford any more .
my project has the message , even the normal people need a living space .
not only refugees but also the self @-@ pulling mother or the ger@@ ear@@ ners .
I am showing how you can build still cheap and well done today .
that is why it is about .

iOS 9 : how you get the new iPhone OS system when Apple Update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; typ@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in General and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Software update . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is ready to download the phone the option to download and then install .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some are pushed back after the installation to problems because they get an error message that communic@@ ates that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update fail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to avoid the problem , users are advised to either wait , until the rush goes back or trying to update via iTunes .
the phone itself leads you through the rest of the process .
this may mean deletion of apps to create space - but Apple has done this through the merging of the updates impro@@ b@@ ably . likewise , it will be easier to do this if you use a specific tool using apps and then install them anew as soon as the process is completed .
it is worth to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a lo@@ ader , so that the battery is loaded .
if the cargo is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue , since the phone could potentially diver@@ ge up half way and this could lead to a break @-@ up of updates .
continue : iOS 9 release still in timetable despite the Wat@@ ch@@ OS delay in review iOS 9 : the least exciting , but the best update for iOS 9 : how to prepare for the new iPhone OS
you should also make sure that you have recently watched our chec@@ kl@@ ist of all things to prevent things wrong and to protect yourself if they tun@@ er it . iOS 9 introduces new features , including a much smar@@ ter personal assistant and enormous new productivity features for the iPad , as well as changes that accelerate and repair the operating system .

while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ low is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is standing on his successor in the coming months with half a spot over the next few months .
after a reconstruction phase , Müller opens the practice on October 12 again , until then he invested € 3@@ 10000 euros into the premises in the St.@@ -@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ straße 6 .
it was sympathy for the first sight to meet Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , who currently holds their expertise in the den@@ er hospital and wants to enter into practice as well .
&quot; we always had in mind that the gar@@ bage would fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ ausen and laugh@@ ing .
&quot; when it was , I simply inv@@ oked it . &quot;
the couple Müller liked the idea to run their own practice in future in the future .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive for us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller .
&quot; we want to meet and accompany the families over the years . &quot;
as an advantage , he will see to be soon his own boss .

about 2000 patients are coming according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l every quarter to the field Fel@@ lowship begins , in the North German average practice it is about 500 .
in As@@ endorf there is a further general practitioner .
a positive side @-@ effect of the practic@@ ality by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains in the Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ ausen in As@@ endorf .
if no successor was found , it would have been .
he visits the ch@@ art@@ works , by the way , moreover continues to be in familiar faces : takes over the seven medical colleges and the det@@ erg@@ ent of the rims .
with their departure there is an era in As@@ endorf , after all , the medical @-@ he lives there for 30 years .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until now , I have always pushed me before gardening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the couple has two grand@@ sons and likes to travel .
Croatia : &quot; we let the refugees go through &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the border controls also took place on our south border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Interior of Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain in parallel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; still , it is clear that everyone who wants to put a asylum application , this could also be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the emphasis and safety of the people stands in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is clear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that it needs significant signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Prime Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the people need to know that we do not accept limit@@ less migration flows , also not over the Austr@@ o @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; corridor , &quot; Slovenia itself
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia wants to continue traveling as further refugees in Austria and Germany and in certain circumstances will gradually establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
in this way , this was not the case of the internal of Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach but not .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Slovenia become rather more monitoring of the border - especially to Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the border with Croatia can be controlled very strongly as the limit of the Schengen area .
as the prime minister stressed , Sloven@@ ians want to set up his borders for refugees but not .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each EU member must fill out its commitments , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ heads Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government passed , the first refugees had already tried in the night hours on Tuesday to travel to East Croatian at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d to avoid the registration .
the Croatian police could act on them in the nearby villages .
according to local media ever since the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik also meet police vehicles with new refugees .
it is predominantly about Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , among them many women and children .
also ambul@@ ance services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days , the country run with around 4,000 refugees , Interior Minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
also , buses from Pres@@ evo at the Maced@@ onian border that were so far brought to the Hungarian border to Croatia , commented on Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the government in Belgrade &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; denied the people to strike certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither can we , nor want we do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the media reports , at least in the morning a first bus was arrived with around 50 refugees in the Ser@@ b border town Si@@ d , during the day , more buses would be expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants have been on the road all night long from the ma@@ z@@ ed@@ onian border with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary has made us so that the police stated that we should go here &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order for a long time , it could actually have been forec@@ ast@@ ed shift to the previous Balkan route Turkey to Greece @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Hungary to a somewhat further west route . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive options for border control &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia &apos;s interior Minister of O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously emphasized that his country for the fall of a strong supply of refugees have prepared corresponding plans for possible conditions of use . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; details did not call it , but it pointed out that Croatia is a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive options for border control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you perform strict controls in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia belongs to this since 2007 , the EU partners facing the country since then deliberately set a good record of what concerns the standard of border controls .
on Serbian side behind the Hungarian border fence , some 300 refugees leave .
according to Bel@@ gra@@ der media we would have spent the past night at the border crossing into Hor@@ gos , who leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border crossing into Hor@@ gos and back@@ i Bre@@ g remains completely locked .
whether the remaining refugees want to go to the Croatian border is still unclear .
the Serbian Minister of State Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic tried to calm early on a local par@@ king@@ card in Hor@@ gos : he kept the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed , for past .
it would not take place for a very high level of refugees .
we could not say if they would continue their journey over Hungary , Croatia or other country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants to - dangerous - alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugee cabin has already begun to distribute the refugees maps , on which alternative routes are incorporated by Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not harmless : in parts of the border area , there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatian Congress , still does not have more clean min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police announced that a team of min@@ ders were sent in the border region .
stock exchanges : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars
Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok is supposed to have heard a ring of cy@@ ber crime , which is pre @-@ tos@@ sed since 2010 to get into still un@@ published financial reports and press releases on sites such as Business Wire , Market@@ place and PR News@@ wire .
with the exploited information insi@@ der transactions should be made on the financial markets .
the investig@@ ators led to a total of over 100 million dollars in this way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our borders are finally captured , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is stated in the S@@ EC Communication . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this case the trials against 32 further accus@@ ations were applied .
most of the def@@ endants are from Ukraine and Georgia .
the offen@@ ders should have been in both the U.S. and Eastern Europe .

puls@@ ating , pr@@ ing life at best autumn sunlight and middle @-@ in four large tables each with the heading &quot; Be@@ fore I die @-@ be &quot; ....
the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hospit@@ all@@ ake made aware of this action on its 20 @-@ year anniversary and are quite faced with mixed reactions .
&quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went with the action in the midst of the city and among men , &quot; says Jos@@ e@@ fine Lam@@ mer .
the mission of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hospit@@ all@@ ake is at your disposal as well as questions and discussions as the volunteer staff .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while some fits up spontane@@ ously to the node and set the phrase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my life &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; read &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the camper through the U.S. , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no long suffer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no matter how &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I am not yet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then proceed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
over and over again there are on the ver@@ ge of little discussion about the action in itself , about life , dealing with dying .
Peter Hü@@ b@@ inger is also on site .
&quot; only when I realise that for me at some stage the end of this world comes , I can act responsi@@ bly , &quot; says the director of the di@@ ac@@ onal plant Mannheim , which is together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ cer@@ ers Association of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ ie System .
therefore , this open an effective action to 20 @-@ year @-@ old is good .
that not everyone wants to publicly communicate on the tablets , be understandable , but ultimately it is a very personal matter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the theme of death and dying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is still afflic@@ ted with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ e@@ fine Lam@@ mer , which has just contributed a lot to the Hosp@@ iz@@ ations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; movement in recent years &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; that people open themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an assessment , shares the Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ roid .
the dying and g@@ ob@@ serves as a part of the volunteers of the first hour .
through personal discussion with the subject , they read a lot of literature and decided to engage in the eu@@ than@@ asia .
as the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hospit@@ all@@ aid was asked by the appeal of Hon@@ orary official , she immediately reported and was at the foundation in the year 1995 .
Go@@ def@@ roid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - sufferers and depend@@ ents in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and in the hosp@@ ice and Vincent accompanied .
all of them are carefully trained .
Angel@@ ika Lake def@@ roid can well deal with her job and her experiences and experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see life from another war@@ te that it is precious and value the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offer of an out@@ patient ec@@ umen@@ ical Hosp@@ iz@@ service is free of charge and con@@ fes@@ sions .
the financial support of the health insur@@ ers and donations of relatives and associations allows training as well as training and supervision of the mort@@ ar and mour@@ ning .
all two years are training courses for new employees .
the boards described on Saturday are now exhibited in the House of the Evangelical Church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the House of the Catholic Church ( F@@ 2 , 6 ) .

F@@ ed@@ ex result was mixed , fin@@ anz outlook for 2016
F@@ ed@@ Ex does not dis@@ appoint results for the last quarter , and the Consu@@ mptions of attracting a profit to a whole year because of the weak@@ est demand for cargo handling and higher costs in his bo@@ dying service .
the company also said that she plans to recru@@ iting about 5@@ 5,000 seasonal work for the holiday .
at this point last year F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to adjust 50,000 seasonal work for the holiday season .
the stock was about 2.5 per cent in the pre @-@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said a prize of 10,@@ 40 US $ and 10,@@ 90 $ in the financial year to earn on the next May , 20 cent less than in earlier predi@@ ction .
an@@ alysts were expecting a survey of the Fac@@ t@@ set 10,@@ 84 $ .
the lower prospect comes despite the price increase , which are average of 4.@@ 9 per cent and are effective on January 4 and despite higher inf@@ ants for the exchange of serious and large packages which will be raised starting from November .
the company said that it still expects that the result in the previous year due to cost reduction , higher income and because of growth in online business will increase .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company hopes &quot; solid yields , &quot; if you consider the weaker , economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
the plans for holiday @-@ employment were announced a day later than those of the Rival U@@ PS , the plans 9@@ 0.000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional staff , roughly the same number as last year .
in the first quarter that ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ 6@@ 92 million US earned , 6 percent more than last year .
the earnings per share tot@@ aling € 2.@@ 42 per share , just below the 2,@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of Z@@ acks Investment Research asked an@@ alysts earlier .
sales rose by 5 percent to 12,@@ 3 billion euros .
six of Z@@ acks asked analy@@ st expected 12,@@ 23 billion $ .
F@@ ed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in international Pri@@ or dispatch during the last few years , in order to increase sales in his unit Express delivery .
but the boom in online @-@ shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter , sales rose by 29 per cent in the last quarter , but the operating result was mainly flat because of higher costs for greater packages and self @-@ insurance .
the express unit fell higher recei@@ pts due to higher prices , while the result sunk for higher labour costs in freight operations .
in the pre @-@ market trade , approximately one hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ ex shares amounts to 3,@@ 85 US $ or 2.5 per cent , to 15@@ 0.@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday , they joined 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
on their most expected meeting in the year , Federal Reserve C@@ ate@@ gen spend two days this week sitting around a 27 @-@ foot @-@ Honduras @-@ table sitting in order to decide whether it is time for the first time since almost a decade to lift .
steady over them at the end of the completed , two @-@ stor@@ eyed seats than is a mur@@ derer of the United States .
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed @-@ chairman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ en and their colleagues shall put the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a double order from the Congress : maxim@@ izing the U.S. employment and prices here to hold stable .
but since the big recession the F@@ ed leaders have recognized that there is an un@@ lock third @-@ level mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to predi@@ ct them . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be reconc@@ iled from an unprecedented stim@@ ulus through the close to zero @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most of the data of the economy show that they are solid , the recent turbul@@ ence in the global financial markets could make the more pru@@ dent F@@ ed representatives to increase this vol@@ ati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal bor@@ es - and even if only one quarter percentage point .
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation in the first place will be the most important thing they watch , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the Mak@@ ler@@ company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think , if they were looking for an excuse to not increase the interest rate , the increased in@@ security around the global market enough justification , further to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which secur@@ es against itself the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists who were recently asked by Bloomberg have predicted that week after this week .
the financial markets are a waiting for the F@@ ed , with a key indi@@ ator , which shows only a 30 % chance of increasing .
this indicates a decline in the share market , if the F@@ ed increased the sentence , unless the strateg@@ ist die off the strike by promising that another increase is far away .
on Tuesday the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage score at 22@@ 7@@ 89 points or by 1,4 % to 16.@@ 5@@ 9@@ 9,@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy keeps the sentence in this week , &quot; said John Lon@@ sky , Chef@@ ö@@ kon@@ om at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would lift the propositions at that time , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she needs to go very far in her explanation to put down the financial markets so they didn &apos;t get panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that a ten@@ sion@@ ing the financial markets would calm down because they would eliminate the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
a month ago , the F@@ ed appeared in good ways to increase the set by 0.@@ 25 percent points per month , the first small step in a slow shar@@ pen@@ ing of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and in the early summer , despite the discomfort of liber@@ als that it would require more economic progress - an increase in the proposition .
though the creation of jobs in August slow@@ ed down , the improvement of the labour market this year was solid .
the unemployment rate declined to 5.@@ 1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and close to the level which sees the F@@ ed as full employment .
wage rates have shown signs of a recovery .
and although inflation constantly went below the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives spoke that the main reason is the temporary impact of much lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can overcome higher interest rates and needs them because of tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d@@ son , chief econom@@ ist at the Pantheon Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets picked up the whole world at the end of the last month , after China had refused its currency .
the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage score was rising in May by more than 16 % , while investors feared that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would increase the global growth of th@@ rot@@ tles .
the market has recovered to this month , whereby the D@@ ow is now nearly 10 % below the high season of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , the tum@@ ul@@ ants influence the complex calculation , when they should increase the interest rates .
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news on the weakness of the Chinese economies in the last few weeks would not have occurred , Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the U.S. staff .
now it is saying that they will wait at least a month to get the effects better get a grip on .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what effects will be on the U.S. economy and there are almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner .
the health of the world economy is none of the major concern of the F@@ ed , therefore it should not be involved in the decision @-@ making of its decision @-@ making .
but in the end , the F@@ ed currency authority has become the world .
the central bank had an impact in recent years .
the mere indication of the then director Ben S. Bern@@ an@@ ke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could be its monetary expansion , &quot; narrow &quot; squ@@ ander@@ ings around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly being inter@@ connected , the F@@ ed representatives are expected to monitor the developments in others , but also with other central banks and experts to get a better understanding of the global economy .
her decision @-@ making is more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of the global strategy for the assets of En@@ vest@@ net Inc .
Jeff@@ rey l@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , commented this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of over@@ re@@ actions on financial market movements that seem to be linked to economic fundament@@ alist data . &quot;
l@@ acker , compens@@ ated member of the Federal Open Market Committee , which supports for a sign @-@ use , cited decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to lower its benchmark interest by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three meetings &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; despite limited recognition of the growth in the US &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said l@@ acker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one year later the F@@ ed @-@ representatives were und@@ one of these cuts .
the F@@ ed should place aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis such as the market re@@ unification of 2008 at the first place , said Adam S. Posen , former member of the committee for the interest rate of the Bank of England .
the recent tur@@ mo@@ il are not near this level , he said .
&quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation where she is afraid of a surprise since the markets ex@@ hilar@@ ate , &quot; said Poznań , president of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until this is changed , I don &apos;t believe they should be expected .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Leben@@ shilfe for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany this days .
your warm welcome to prepare you , does not go without the commitment of innumerable volunteer care@@ ers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ selfish asylum seekers in the city .
these include Petra and Klaus Heine .
Petra Heinrich is with body and soul teacher .
even with their 74 rounds , they are still taught .
every Thursday she does it in the asylum seekers at the D@@ ill@@ inger street .
there will help refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German language .
that is of course a very different lesson than at the right school .
Brazil &apos;s pa@@ edi@@ atric Association Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ atric organization SP@@ RS is trying to clear up how important good nutrition during the l@@ ac@@ tation is . she does this with the presentation of pictures of babies that su@@ ck in bro@@ therhood that are used with depic@@ tions of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers form their daily cal@@ orie intake to increase about 500 calories per day .
however , new research results indicate that higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adaptation that should make the mothers .
a recent study conducted under the direction of Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet is pregnant women indeed affect the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can neg@@ atively impact the immune system .
exceptions for the new am@@ ber of sports hall
the council of Bern@@ ried approved the building entry for the 2,@@ 3 million euros expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof can be fl@@ atter for solar installation .
the plans for the long @-@ looking gymn@@ os@@ en@@ building on the Bern@@ ese sport ground step forward step by step : in the recent community meeting , the built @-@ in building was lo@@ wered without a large discussions un@@ hur@@ led .
&quot; &quot; &quot; previously , the panel was decided by another application for a structural &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; exemp@@ tion from the valid development plan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the &quot; exception &quot; there was a permit for a special form regarding the construction construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; accordingly , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle @-@ roof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be built with non @-@ long first and roof level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; background of planning is the planned use of the roof surface for solar systems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , we get together a wonderfully large Sü@@ dd@@ ach &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explained Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the session . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the &quot; liberation &quot; , in turn , the roo@@ fing that for energetic reasons - unlike in the br@@ is plan is planned - under ten degrees .
the volume of the hall is significantly reduced .
a &quot; deliver@@ ance &quot; was therefore necessary because of the development plan for the bad@@ ges no &quot; exceptions &quot; allowed - with the am@@ ber of the common pri@@ des normally restri@@ cting it more restri@@ ctive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , at the gym is not a recur@@ ring project : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turn@@ around at the sports center is a community project of the municipality and the SV Bern@@ ried .
the cost of around 2,@@ 3 million euros has been calculated .
subsidies are expected from the school and l@@ atitude .
in the next process step , the building request for the 18 x 36 metres large hall is now submitted to the Land@@ rat@@ lo@@ ader for the examination .
clinic P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the Hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg can be closed earlier as planned - namely 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is the new medical director at the P@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station and the majority of employees come from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg with Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this shows the surprising plans of the Hospital GmbH of Land@@ circle , the land@@ lady Andrea Jo@@ chner @-@ White .
the Supervisory Board is elected , and the opposition to the coming Wednesday , 23 September .
if plans are to be put into action , all of the nearly 50 employees in the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg should continue .
the overwhelming majority should be moved with fishermen and on the existing inside station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
employees , who are not able to go to Sch@@ ong@@ au , will be offered a work place in W@@ eil@@ heim , so Jo@@ chner .
the staff will be informed of their plans .
triggered the change of notice by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who is only since the beginning of the year of the Medical Director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Clinic and now changes to a private office in close proximity to the hospital .
at the question of who the follow @-@ up came to take , according to Jo@@ chner , the name of &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , who agreed to take charge of the management and exchange with his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this is in every case a &quot; appreciation &quot; and a wi@@ dening of the range of internal medicine , &quot; Jo@@ chner and White .
Fischer is a specialist for heart @-@ step and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialised on the internal station on gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ologic illnesses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; coming to the next two years , fishermen with his team , if the Supervisory Board agrees to give both houses , until then next year the former hospital of Kn@@ app@@ y , which has still more than 35 beds , must finally be closed down after nearly 140 years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to now , the country had planned this for 2018 when the current renovation works at the Hospital W@@ eil@@ heim .
Land@@ s@@ tin Jo@@ chner and White , which is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board , stood con@@ gru@@ ent to which the house , which is owned by the federal square , will in future be used as an accommodation for asylum p@@ ines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I fell out of course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I slept with the property , Jo@@ chner did not say , there were several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at present there are a short @-@ term care of the Car@@ itas and a meeting @-@ psychiat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so Fischer over the Qu@@ asi Mov@@ ing to the Le@@ ch , who has been received by the employees &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house where fishermen have worked as chief for over 30 years , I have not given it .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to assume the position of the medical director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was threatened in closing again in recent decades , departments have been closed , for example the surgery and the obst@@ et@@ rics .
the handles of all the Rhine @-@ N@@ eck@@ ar lions are requested in the evening ( 20.@@ 3 p.m. ) at the Berg@@ ischen HC .

during re@@ ap@@ ing on a Ma@@ is@@ feld near Pr@@ at@@ au ( rural district of Witt@@ enberg ) there were several hunters in use as the police took .
after a shame , a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought to hospitals .
just as it could come to the accident it was first unclear .

a tat@@ too has brought the police to the ly@@ che of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
in the inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old were killed , the young people killed and their corp@@ se were thrown into a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
one since Saturday was missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate , has fallen victim to a violence .
the Lei@@ che of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen on Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern at Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as prosecution and police on Wednesday .
as a tat@@ too , one also applies as a fer@@ vent 20 @-@ year @-@ old , who have indeed stressed the indicate and the investig@@ ator led to a place of loan .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was missed on Sunday mor@@ nings after they had come home on the eve of a fall in rock@@ enh@@ ausen on the eve of a fall in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
when searching for a young woman the investig@@ ator had first performed on personal objects of the victim .
with surveys in the friend@@ ships and acquaint@@ ances of the mis@@ ses he finally turned out a pa@@ ff@@ led against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the suspected perpetrators led the police to a channel in rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the ly@@ re was found .
the festival was alleged to have been killed in the police trial , who killed 16 @-@ year old , and put the corp@@ se in the canal .

refugees need accommodation : study war@@ ns of housing
the situation in the German market market is tense .
also more and more refugees are looking for a paid bed .
pressure on the market market grows .
social housing is facing a challenge .
the distribution @-@ fights on the German market market have long ago been started .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the coming refugees and seekers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is now over@@ bur@@ dened in many big cities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they compete with income @-@ weak citizens about the last paid apartments .
in order to cover the demand for affordable housing , it would have to be 400@@ ,000 new units up to 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this result is a study on behalf of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social housing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
by comparison : this year we have 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units finished .
thus there are 14@@ 0.000 apartments .
refugees are no longer obligated in their stay after the first three months of their stay , as an asylum seek@@ er in an initial preparation .
many come across to the apartment market and ranks within the long sn@@ akes in front of the flats .
however , according to the Federal Office the Bundes@@ amt dwelt in the last year less than half of all asylum seekers .
however , the negative development of the apartment market lies not only in the rising commodities .
the study also has considerable om@@ is@@ sions in housing policy of recent years .
Germany seemed to become a housing deficit one year ago , which is greater from year to year .
currently missing in the ballo@@ ons have already been around 77@@ 0.000 units , lam@@ ents Matthias Günther , author of the study .
many working people therefore lived in large cities with not@@ ations in WG @-@ rooms .
young adults stayed due to the lau@@ te of the apartment no longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama . &quot;
in large cities the number of square meter per head has dropped again in the past few years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order to resolve the problem , the alliance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social housing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strikes a new beginnings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this should stimulate new incentives to social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus could be wai@@ ved on the cru@@ de tax and the base tax for sponsored apartments can be suspended .
moreover , the Alliance &apos;s attractive tax @-@ recovery is necessary .
the support for refugee space of the State Bank Kf@@ W comes from cities and communities now .
a good week after the start was , at the end of the Monday , 184 million Euros had been reduced by some 300 million euros .
now , the project could even be improved .
refugees have free v@@ eit : Croatia and Slovenia direct cor@@ rid@@ ors
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Hungary , practically no transit is coming more , since more and more refugees choose the way through Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zagreb An@@ no@@ ds to give transit through Slovenia to north without hur@@ d@@ les .
however , the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighboring land of Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; I have spoken to the Sloven@@ ian Interior , and if it is necessary we will organize a corridor , &quot; said the Croatian Interior of Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
Slovenia is situated between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU @-@ country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees arrive after Croatia to go from there to Western Europe .
500 people have arrived at the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports to the Croatian Fern@@ hen@@ hen@@ sive RT@@ L .
Hungary had its border to refugees on the day before .
new laws , which entered into force on the same day , will practically superf@@ lu@@ ous asylum procedure in Hungary .
Croatia wants to let the refugees happen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic stated : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they can travel through and we prepare for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and do something .
but there are people who do not want to live in Croatia .
in the morning the Croatian police had picked up the first refugees on Serbia &apos;s border to the EU neighbouring country .
most popular media artists reported there from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came both by bus and bus to the Serbian border town of Si@@ d .
immediately after her arrival she would have been attemp@@ ting to walk through the green border to Croatia .
on the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , refugees do not encounter the border .
for this , the Border Cros@@ sing other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mine @-@ spatial must therefore quickly create a secure passage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after Hungary , after the closure of the border , hardly any more refugees arrive .
on Tuesday the police counted 3@@ 66 thousand people .
just before the gate on Monday it was still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws stages the overcoming and damage of the bor@@ der@@ za@@ ar as a crime .
therefore , in the south @-@ Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eged , there have been 35 criminal off@@ ences initiated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the condemned force pen@@ alties came to five years and the de@@ portation from the country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the immigration authorities , the new &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tran@@ ch@@ ons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; authorities stopped at the beginning on Tuesday , almost all of them - 93 - at the most important transition in R@@ ös@@ ch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among the manufacturers are 13 families with small children as well as two elderly people .
on Wednesday morning there were still 40 refugees to have stopped .
practically nobody has given any more a prospect in Hungary asylum .
after odd , Serbia is a &quot; safe third country . &quot;
the exp@@ ired asylum seekers were supposed to be be@@ v@@ elled there .
in front of the &quot; transit @-@ zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke there were only a few hundred refugees .
in R@@ ös@@ ch workers began to lay up with it .
it gathered the rub@@ b@@ ish , the tens of thousands of people left over the road@@ side .
Lock cr@@ aps was dis@@ assembled and one of the en@@ clos@@ eness in the bor@@ der@@ site was rebuilt .
no one wanted to express about the aim of this re@@ building .
Austria reach only a few refugees after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
the country also reinforced its border controls .
around 20,000 migrants continued to reign , but still in the country .
in Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany .
in the morning the rail traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the instruction of German authorities .
in free@@ wheel , smaller groups of refugees meet on foot .
Mayor said , &quot; Tow@@ els &quot; over the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were busy following the bridge on Sunday with the show@@ rooms , when suddenly ten people were standing with travel @-@ off@@ s at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; stated Wern@@ stein &apos;s Mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ el@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists who wanted to get there by train to Pass@@ au .
for Germany on Sunday however , because of the refugee @-@ stream the railway traffic with Austria was surprisingly set , she was immediately greeted in Wern@@ stein , &quot; said the city , who immediately offered his help and the Gest@@ apo together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars on the border into the Nah@@ e Pass@@ au .
previously we made the most uns@@ ha@@ ired guests only once , with J@@ ause and drink .
we said the same , we drive them by car to Pass@@ au .
&quot; that was a matter of course for us , &quot; said the Centre in O@@ Ö@@ N conversation .
they were very grateful .
a man did not allow himself to commit a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire@@ bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this has been very pleased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; So the city . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the stran@@ ded train links were moved on Sunday evening in Wels to a ICE in a regional train towards Pass@@ au , in order to exp@@ el it after the short notice , that the railway traffic to Germany was submitted , but still trying to cross the border .
but the regional train was put before the border in Wern@@ stein am Inn .
in Wern@@ stein is the cross @-@ border generally high in the course .
the Brü@@ cken@@ fest association with the Bav@@ arian neighbours on Sunday soci@@ able , have previously played a twin @-@ brid@@ ge@@ ance - organized by the Union of Wern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án has sent another fu@@ zz to us , is a log@@ istic result of a seem@@ ing politics :
instead of helping in the camp R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke immediately in the establishment of structures to ensure humanity has high @-@ official and publicly advoc@@ ated the attitude of the Hungarian government in the Dun@@ es of National Socialism .
ly@@ re @-@ bearing of this policy are not just those Austri@@ ans who now face in the border regions with chaotic states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees also need to find that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yellow country &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who invited them and welcomed nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will be a great challenge facing the continuing refugee currents and the approaching winter , with us to create decent conditions for human @-@ seekers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it will be an even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad in search of 3@@ 5.000 W @-@ solid Qu@@ arti@@ eren
finally , Konrad has full of his hands with the Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Christian Konrad is it used , that his word has its weight .
the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen banker to raise quot@@ as for thousands of refugees .
the chaos at the First Con@@ tract Centre Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already got a grip on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported on his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the accommodation of 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was without great tur@@ mo@@ il , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and praised the organizational &quot; master &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the interior of the Interior spoke of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cryp@@ tic situation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
overall , Konrad with a requirement of 8@@ 5,000 Qu@@ arti@@ eren counts in the he@@ ur@@ ly year .
to meet the number , the following weeks will have to be found 3@@ 5.000 accommodations in the next few weeks - 20,000 people will be able to provide € 15@@ ,000 of the states .
should it be more refugees we can do it .
&quot; but it is not a cas@@ ks without a ground , &quot; said Konrad .
with the governor , he has already led talks .
they would have promised him , even for the coming refugees to be lod@@ gings .
&quot; in Upper Austria it works well , &quot; said Ferry Mai@@ er .
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar is supported Konrad .
in the morning there will be a meeting with Card@@ inal Christoph Schön@@ born and will be trans@@ figured out how the Church will help .
high expectations of the Asyl@@ um Coordinator also in the OR@@ F promotion &quot; Hel@@ ps like us . &quot;
it is based on the platform to offer private people and uncomplicated accommodation .
also , you are hoping for hotels that are empty in winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ised the standards for accommodation as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in emergen@@ cies , it is not possible that Qu@@ arti@@ sans need to keep a certain amount of the hand holder or size of the surface .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary period of time would have to apply &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; additional standards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that in contrast to the interior of the Ministry of Economic Affairs , he was successful with his experience .
I am an older gentle@@ man , whom one does not say without another into the face of fal@@ se@@ hood .
persu@@ asi@@ veness is its most important weapon .
finally Con@@ rad and Mai@@ er do not cause the Republic as they explained .
your head@@ count will increase them on three to four .
your own food search has not yet been successful .
Konrad wanted to place a container on Steph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but , there are apparently problems with the permit .
Linz needs a better distribution
there is only no opening of city sports halls and other buildings like Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center to accommodate refugees is planning the city of Linz .
at the moment , this is not necessary , as the data are currently able to place without these measures , Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger says ( SP ) .
in case of emergency , further sites are to be tested for their capacity .
criticism shall be exercised by the chef on the division of refugees within the federal state .
other areas also have to make their contribution here .
Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer : &quot; borders are not sealed &quot;
in a longer call with the Bav@@ arian Prime Minister Horst Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer ( CS@@ U ) the governor of Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) has sent further steps to the refugee issue .
s@@ ah@@ o@@ fer have assured me that the German boundaries cannot be sealed .
the continued journey of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany remains possible .
however , there is now the corresponding border controls .
special orders with refugees to Germany will not give it a more time .
the prot@@ esting grounds would however have been brought to Germany with regular journeys to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for increased solidarity in the refugee question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; that as well as Austria leads again to its limits , is a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the procedure of Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a question of time
the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Lin@@ zer Chamber &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been officially completed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the stock market S &amp; T group is switched to S &amp; T , the rest ( 2@@ 700 square meters ) is supposed to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; in IT the clever head are our raw material - and we have to try that they work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T CEO Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er .
he can imagine to invest in start@@ up companies of the New Wer@@ ft and later on to act as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; right from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - which promises a considerable cause : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is only a question of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
1.@@ 7 million euros have been invested by S &amp; T into the site , 3.@@ 3 million euros from the Tech@@ center , one of the third of the city of Linz , the country of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is distinguished from the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ center .
30 per cent of the 2@@ 700 square meter surface in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent give it requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second store in the arc@@ ades
in the new shop Fur@@ la @-@ hand@@ bags are at the center .
actually , Jutta wanted to set up a dog .
this project had to shift the 49 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ old @-@ owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the pi@@ geon @-@ arc@@ ades , and eventually she has gained momentum in the form of another business location .
in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop across the business , in which it sells bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and spices of various manufacturers , now turns all around the Dam@@ en@@ hand@@ bags of the Fur@@ la brand , pur@@ ses from 75 Euro .
larger pockets and accessories for up to 500 Euros .
since yesterday the new shop is in use .
at the moment several weeks been rebuilt .
&quot; but I don &apos;t consider a long time whether I want to open a store , &quot; says broad .
among other things , the deciding factor for deciding was also the Fur@@ la producers who are at home in Bologna from the idea of an own location where only her hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; we are the ones in the Greater Region of Linz , who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who has even Italian roots .
their fashion interest has been wide from her mother in the cradle .
I de@@ pl@@ ore me most if something develops and I can show new trends in performance prices .
why so some wife in the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in shipping unit , even the house@@ wife can not answer with last security .
perhaps it &apos;s in mind that a beautiful bag will be upgraded to every out@@ fit .
the Br@@ ul@@ l@@ jes@@ macher of K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pf@@ alz ancestors of Donald Tru@@ mp came from a place whose inhabitants are called An@@ ders .
this characteristic un@@ ites also with the billi@@ on@@ aire , the US President .
Donald Tru@@ mp ( 69 ) is always good for any @-@ off .
whether he vo@@ iced his xen@@ opho@@ bia , journalist , or researcher speaking in the international crisis policy - the applicant for the U.S. presidential election was fighting power@@ fully .
and cuts well with them .
this is also registered in the pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ischen K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate agent could originate .
the New Yorker with the bo@@ asting is a lot in the Win@@ zer@@ dorf on the wine road .
man@@ cher in the 1200 @-@ inhabit@@ ant place is about -@@ rough edges with it is related to it .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Palat@@ inate : Donald Tru@@ mp , here in the election mode .
the K@@ all@@ ów Simone Wen@@ del turned a film about Tru@@ mp .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about their goal , to become the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that somehow is interesting , but are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ enberg style , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native Croatian city has a am@@ using documentary about the location and its famous Spr@@ os@@ s@@ lings that Heinz count also the Ket@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp , who is not known for mod@@ esty comes in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2014 ) also to say - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he did not put it to the king of the hearts .
although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also tend to think that Tru@@ mp &quot; is a bit a big mas@@ mouth , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
random the nick@@ name , the c@@ all@@ ay in the radius , &quot; The Br@@ ul@@ l@@ jes@@ macher &quot; - too high @-@ German : the en@@ coder , says it .
Tru@@ mp is therefore coming from the village of the en@@ coder .
the Tru@@ mp &apos;s success story began 1885 , when the later grandfather hi@@ ked and in the US opened a pub for the graves .
foundation of the property company were first bar@@ code in New York .
however , the life of grand@@ parents was not free from tragedy : their desire to return to the home in the long term , was failed to once belonged to the Bav@@ arian State , to which the Palat@@ inate was at that time .
he did not record Tru@@ mp , because he was once ch@@ opped without permission , was the director of the Institute for Pa@@ oli@@ tic History and People &apos;s History , Roland Paul , for the start of film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal &quot; emig@@ rant &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this applies in contrast to the names of the follow @-@ up statements of the follow @-@ up .
he had repeatedly talked about the Mexican immigrants in the US and demanded to build a border wall to det@@ ach illegal immigrants .
&quot; as the pol@@ em@@ ing , this is not so symp@@ athetic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relatives of Tru@@ mp@@ s ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a native syn@@ mp , the Op@@ a was sal@@ v@@ aged Heinz &quot; ) .
the win@@ em@@ aker l@@ ak@@ age sees the Americans rather dist@@ anced , &quot; he is always so grave . &quot;
does he believe that Tru@@ mp is coming ?
&quot; I cannot imagine , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he never cares about K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Pen@@ sion@@ wir@@ ine Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ram@@ m men@@ tions how some k@@ all@@ stad@@ ters mentioned that a desc@@ endant of the family Heinz with visiting something for the church officials led what is generally good .
&quot; I can not imagine that of Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old .
they f@@ aint it better if he did not dar@@ ing the choice as &quot; he has such a radical view , I do not know if that is good . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when those who had had Sa@@ wing in the US at the time of his grandfather , would have been like him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would he never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ ck Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; my president is not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : &quot; the grapes become ri@@ pe without the president of Tru@@ mp . &quot;

Seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise dominates the reviews , despite the attempts of Nine , to take the loss of leader at the today show
Karl Stef@@ ano@@ vic and Lisa Wil@@ k@@ inson &apos;s home after Can@@ ber@@ ra to report after the loss of the leaders &apos; leadership , but it didn &apos;t take large shifts on the reviews for today .
the break@@ age of Nine was broadcast by the federal state capital , when Mal@@ col@@ m turn the fall by Tony Ab@@ bot .
the ri@@ val Sun@@ rise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ Days , stuck in London as part of a one @-@ week series of international television programs , which also belonged to Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
this down@@ side of the st@@ asis seemed to play any role for the Australian TV audience because Sun@@ rise has aver@@ aged above 39@@ 7@@ ,000 spectators at the five main cities , compared to today ( 33@@ 9.@@ 000 ) .
today , a slight increase in the rate of ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but his number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today , the gap has been closed over the last few months .
in August Today was an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to the 33@@ 0.000 of Sun@@ rise .
at the beginning of the year the distance was between 40@@ ,000 and 50,000 .
until now in September Sun@@ rise has an average of 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators and 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in today .
this is the most exciting , what happens every morning .
the winds of change concerns this morning more than the parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thanks for the review !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series star of A to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama of a recently wit@@ ted father who decides to settle in the New Zealand coast with his two children reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million spectators .

the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; yes . &quot;
the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million spectators and hit by The block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8@@ ,000 ) and T@@ B@@ L Family ( 7@@ 26 000 ) .
seven Seven had mixed results in the evening two by The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 5.@@ 30 p.m. ) of the new qui@@ z @-@ show , hosted by Andrew O &apos;@@ k@@ ee@@ ched sur@@ rendered on average 44@@ ,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 - 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little win over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ess Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .

the last three agree : Bachelor &apos;s Wood Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
secret revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki probably have unknow@@ ingly expos@@ ing who The Bachelor wins .
the woman , at the Sam Wood in The Bachelor finally lands , was devast@@ ated in greatest secrecy .
and none of the three remaining girl will certainly not award , whether they have the one the last rose is received .
but when we met with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons , in the daytime before coming out of three two , you might have acci@@ dently a hint of who will be the winner .
Sam Wood continues his lips until the finale at Thursday fixed .
all three women have left themselves in the ly@@ rical way of why wood is the perfect man and sty@@ led his sense of humor , ambition , family values , and positive attitude as reason why they would like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who should get W@@ oods last Rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could their answers to the game will be destroyed , who won the heart of the Bachelor &apos;s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki - standing both fast - except itself - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for the wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from day one .
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and ( Sarah &apos;s ) and Sam@@ i energies spot@@ ted , I noticed that they were quite compatible and I have thought throughout the course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows .
&quot; Sarah is standing on the ground with both feet on the ground , it &apos;s so much fun to be together with her , &quot; she added Mark@@ os@@ ki .
I have seen them together , and they have the correct chemistry .
you will feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood were suitable as a couple .
from her point of view M@@ ack@@ ay said that the house visit last week her clearly did that wood &quot; the One could be .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I saw him with my friends and family , I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I &apos;m sorry un@@ condi@@ tionally to it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked , whom Wood should choose , if not she , she was pu@@ zz@@ ling .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said .
I love the remaining girl alike - it is a tie between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor is broadcast on Wednesday , 19 : 30 , on top .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne has several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest following his move to the USA - and there were many other teams working after his impressive day training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a clever decision .
some coaches had ex@@ iled Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bench as he lost a bar@@ angel so much as the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by league conver@@ ts on Tuesday did in the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minnesota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula trust his man and gave Hay@@ es the next opportunity to a p@@ unt return and also in the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula showed its true face in the locker room after the game .
instead of applying his ro@@ ok@@ ies in front of the rest of the team by the gr@@ inder , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ s@@ ula increased Hay@@ ne also in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Sports re@@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ es also was encouraged by teams @-@ coordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who ri@@ dden him to forget his lost F@@ ang and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne , in a p@@ unt , restored in the first game district of Minnesota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start to mark Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian followers for his N@@ FL de@@ pot .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the F@@ um@@ ble flu@@ x and told later the Australian Radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not imagine no worse off at his N@@ FL career .
&quot; that was a thing that happens now , you only takes care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; said Hay@@ ne .
Hay@@ es de@@ fle@@ es the he@@ aters with his Orig@@ in debut then in 2007 , when a passport held at his own in @-@ Go@@ al area at a T@@ ry for Queensland .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

the Free voters are calling for the high refugee amounts the attitude of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria .
party - and leader of Hubert Ai@@ w@@ anger , at the beginning of the F@@ W @-@ Aut@@ umn , at the beginning of a serious crisis at Bay@@ erns schools , if there is no new teacher respectively for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers in order to protect schools before the collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger .
&quot; otherwise we will get dig@@ res@@ sions in the Bav@@ arian education system . &quot;
the Land@@ tag fraction of the free elec@@ torate will pun@@ ish by Friday in the Spanish @-@ speaking Commun@@ e .
actually , very different main themes were planned .
but the record number of refugees now dominates the Free voters meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the topic of asylum will store the clo@@ ister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ w@@ anger demanded the establishment of UN security zones for refugees in Syria , as did it during the Yugoslavia and in the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it is not further , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free voters boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seekers , the Free voters want to post@@ p@@ one as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , Ai@@ w@@ anger demanded more staff for the management of management which is responsible for asylum applications : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least fifty new asylum seekers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W leader critici@@ zed that several states cannot be consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we look at national common standards of the federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bav@@ arian sho@@ ves others not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there we need to be able to act in action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the country &apos;s politics should not fall under the table under the table .
one years of continuous work remains on the agenda : the education policy .
for the new school year , K@@ ult@@ ine Minister Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) received a pilot of high class power plus &quot; launched in which an extension of the high concentration camp was tested by three to four years - the result it takes nine years to finish .
however , that is not far enough .
&quot; the topic G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; said the F@@ W boss .
we are calling for freedom of choice for all upper secondary schools that want to .
free travel at G@@ 9 wherever it will be desired .

the D@@ ow Jones Index finally listed about 1 percent in the plus in the USA .
many of the stock markets may expect the markets to be at the forefront only after the interest decision in the USA and also to major dis@@ connections on this Friday .
the discussion about the bur@@ dens of the atomic growth has pushed down the shares of RW@@ E with a record deep and also left deep traces on eon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the German energy levels , perhaps 30 billion Euros of provisions are lacking . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Government is denied the numbers mentioned in the press .
as a result , the shares of the two largest German energy sectors were recovered , but ultimately , however , lost 3,@@ 31 per cent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( eon ) .
Infin@@ eon shares went on the D@@ ax top by more 3.@@ 22 percent .

accordingly investors loss of the German chip board is at present too little attention .

4 people killed after police officers on the demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal , after the police attacks in a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , said a civil servant on Wednesday .
the violence broke out in the district of Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi , about 175 miles west of the capital city Kathmandu .
Bish@@ op@@ ad D@@ ha@@ ired , guiding District Apostle , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside a police station , whereby some of them were stones and bran@@ ded foot@@ prints .
Mr D@@ ha@@ ired said the police have used tre@@ k@@ eng@@ es and then shot in the air before they handle on rubber bul@@ lets .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were in@@ ju@@ red , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the applied rubber bul@@ lets , known by which they can kill , but they are traditionally used as less deadly alternative , apparently such a high death rate .
the debate was the last in weeks of violent protest in Nept@@ une , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces , which would be formed within the framework of the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence .
there were also protests in the Western Nepal from the ethnic group of those who want to establish their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officials , have been employed in violent conflicts since the 10th century .
August , when the four big political parties have drawn up an agreement that divide the country into provinces , a major step toward a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal governed by centuries .
the work of a new constitution since 2008 is on its way , but the legis@@ lators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that had killed in April thousands of people .
the legis@@ lat@@ ure have voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the Constitutional Court in Kathmandu and officials said that the new constitution might come into force on Sunday .

the Inter@@ est , the medium @-@ sized agent of the company &quot; System @-@ Bau , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday Even@@ ing in the urban development committee .
originally this point was on the non @-@ public part of the order of the day .
under pressure from the project critic and the F@@ DP Group , who warn the investors and the administration of intelligence , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ingen went from the System @-@ Building Management to the Offen@@ sive : &quot; we have not yet been able to answer all questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to be able to meet all the rum@@ ors now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these around ten to twelve million Euro expensive projects have been in discussion for months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
fierce reactions among stra@@ in@@ ers , who were come into the session , they called for the pictures and new details for the desired hotel construction .
Roberto Schulz , Meer@@ head@@ owner and Board member of the Adv@@ oc@@ ation of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , lam@@ ents : &quot; this is a huge cube , which overlooks the rest of the other building . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , he fears like a certain other project critic , that the traffic by the intended size of the plant would increase greatly : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there all b@@ out@@ inv@@ itations will come , so that it is reck@@ oned , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what happens exactly on the well a h@@ ect@@ are of the old Gast@@ stätte , is still open .
there is still no operator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , we need to have a concl@@ usive concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ung . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of this still lacking , but also the buildings are still variable .

Google starts re@@ double don@@ ating campaign to raise 11 million $ for refugees
Google Inc . ( GO@@ O@@ GL . o ) announced a dou@@ bling pair of funds aimed at which thousands of refugees shall help the thousands of refugees who have ro@@ pe@@ de the European nations as they flee from war and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to the disclosure of donations to their blog .
instead of making a manager to let the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google assistant who served with her family from Kab@@ ul when she was seven years old , about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to our journey , many dark railway and bus trips , as well as hunger , thir@@ st , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but since the refugees and migrants in Europe grew , many people like my family des@@ perate after help .
the donations are taking place in four non @-@ profit organisations that provide help to refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first global funds raised up to a value of 5.5 million at google.com .
Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .
many refugees also from the war har@@ med Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

for easy overweight diabe@@ tics can be helpful to weight loss surgery .
the advantages of weight loss surgery is slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes may after a new study last for at least five years .
it is still too early to say if slightly overweight people with diabetes after the weight loss surgery longer live than those that do not receive @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mortality need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of the weight loss surgery , who wrote a editorial to the new study in J@@ ama Surgery .
weight loss or obesity surgery , use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s own ability to absorb food .
over the years of obesity have proven to be efficient in the treatment of type @-@ 2 diabetes , but most studies have been carried out by people that disease is obes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain degree of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with BM@@ I over 30 are considered to be obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , researchers from Tai@@ wan@@ an min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital Data collected that have been collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity and gast@@ ric therapy - to medical treatments for type @-@ 2 @-@ diabetes for people who were slightly overweight .
the average BM@@ I among those subjected to this operation decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , the BM@@ I remained among those who non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments were about equal to 29 .
among those who undergo a surgical procedure , get up with 36 % of the diabetes @-@ disease and at 28 % partially .
in the medical @-@ treated group , diabetes was more than only a percentage and partially at only two per cent in case of diabetes .
furthermore , the results were in the control of blood pressure , the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and the &quot; poor &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol &quot; generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , &quot; the authors were out .
the researchers also o@@ vers@@ aw the patient @-@ blood cell of h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels in the course of time .
ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , then write the researchers .
after surgery , the average ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c has declined from around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
in the medical treatment group , however , it remained stable at about 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - decreased not the mortality in five years , so the guiding researcher Dr. chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also gives average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the B@@ yp@@ ass surgery group had lost more weight ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , improved reg@@ ress in the BM@@ I ( 3.@@ 1 % vs. 2.@@ 1 % ) and caused more to overcome diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show a survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are evidence from a study of he@@ avier people in Sweden that performs surgery to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , it was under@@ gone through fat @-@ p@@ aced people who suffer from obesity , about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that conventional methods have been conventional .
although the new study showed no advantage for survival on the surgery patients , Black@@ stone , it is soothing for persons with a BM@@ I among 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; this is the critical point in this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said .
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start to take weight seriously as soon as the patient is with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we are waiting too long until we get people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think once they accum@@ ulate these genetic changes that have bound their body with obesity and diabetes , is revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot;
love plays in H@@ uns@@ rück

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe could not take up all refugees , the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East had begun . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan @-@ Buddhist leaders urge the violence in the countries of the refugees to end the refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of lasting refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visits in the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford that dedic@@ ates themselves to ethics .
he urged that under the actual circumstances the interests of humanity should be put before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of West European countries has enjoyed the refugee crisis , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the Dalai Lama was praised in Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to meet the crisis , he stressed that there is only a temporary solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; worrying about several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions like a true peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , he stressed .
ultimately we must think about how the killing is dimin@@ ished in their countries .
we need to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of force never solved the problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama spoke the problem of violence and commented on George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack of September 11 and presented that the violent response from the US attracted a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 I have expressed my sympath@@ ies in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to resolve this problem lies in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he put violence a , and that has unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four @-@ fold increase of ing@@ di@@ m@@ icide by children from the last 4 years
po@@ ison control centers in the US report about a nearly 400 @-@ percentage increase in the number of children under the age of twelve , which are strongly alcoholic and disinf@@ ect@@ ant , so Georgia Po@@ ison Centre .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenue of manual aids in children under 12 years , running the tox@@ ins control centres , from 3.@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; children come more frequently to these products and sadly a percentage of them go in Not@@ ting , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N .
he said that some children are disinf@@ ect@@ ant dis@@ infection , while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ation in social media .
show videos on YouTube show like young people disinf@@ ect@@ ants only because of a cheap experience .
teenagers have alle@@ ge@@ dly mixed a disinf@@ ect@@ ant with soft drink water to obtain a tough@@ er drink .
younger children can be covered by attractive scents of the disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez .
many of the more attractive ( hand @-@ ger@@ m@@ icide ) are those that are par@@ ed .
there is a disinf@@ ect@@ ant with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange colour , which are very pleasing for children .
hanging des@@ i@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially for small children can already lead a few spra@@ zer on alcohol @-@ poison@@ ing .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Th@@ orn@@ ton , medical director of the Gi@@ et@@ not@@ ch Hospital in the Hospital of K@@ ans@@ as , the Radio Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City .
so , you would not let any sip whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and if children come to it , then it is a quick way to consume much alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who had recently taken four sp@@ lash of straw@@ berry in school or brought to school was brought into an emergency condition .
your blood @-@ soft concentration was 179 twice higher than the threshold that is being drunk at an adult rather than drunk , Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey said a not@@ ting doctor who treated them in the G@@ winn@@ eton Medical Center outside Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ h her words and was not able to go when she came to an emergency .
doctors watch them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital at signs of deer trau@@ ma , because the girl had fallen through alcohol and looked upon the head , she said Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; this was very frigh@@ tening , &quot; said Or@@ tor@@ ia Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ahs &apos;s mother , CN@@ N .
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez is recommended to use parents and teachers to use soft @-@ free products or dis@@ infection and to store hand@@ or outside the reach of the child .
over alcohol poison@@ ing were a few disinf@@ ect@@ ants associated with death .
in 2013 two women were killed in Ontario women after the swal@@ lowing of dealer agents , who mis@@ ed a toxic , non @-@ kl@@ ed ingredient .
employee of health authorities susp@@ ect that the product meth@@ anol has been produced , a deadly solution , rather than eth@@ anol , which has been noted as active ingredients .
in January , three students of the fourth class in the New York State were planning to cur@@ ate their &quot; teacher &quot; by bacterial products round the educational room , &quot; there is a police report .

de Bo@@ er , currently an Ambassador to Ajax , said : &quot; in Holland you will show any highlights from Celtic Games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people here are not just talking about the return of the Rang@@ ers .
they speak about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested .
there is a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m playing , and it &apos;s not just the people of Scotland who want to see these games .
I will roll things around , sw@@ am d@@ eil@@ a .
R@@ onn@@ y D@@ eil@@ a has accepted that Celtic will fight , but the Norwegian chef does swe@@ ar to turn the things around .
after the defeat of Malmö and the subsequent withdrawal from the Champions League followed the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aberdeen , who now stand with five points lead clearly at the top of the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but D@@ eil@@ a said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic had already had bad times before and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
I know it is very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel this exactly - but we have to go on .
we really need to really support the support provided by Celtic because that makes the player better .
now to stand together is so important .

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged while in the United Kingdom altogether .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July in 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom came to $ 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 per cent lay above that of the UK@@ s of 5.5 per cent , as shown the figures of the offices for National Statistics ( ons ) .
in the meantime , employment fell in Scotland around 12,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2.@@ 6@@ 12,000 .
the employment rate for Scotland fell in the course of the Quart@@ et at 7@@ 4.3 percent - a number above the UK average of 7@@ 3,5 percent .

why I will be witness@@ ing an exec@@ ution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
a little later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is being put to death .
when it happens and I hope that it doesn &apos;t happen , I will sit in a viewer gallery at the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Beh@@ sip is ex@@ tradi@@ ted by the Gi@@ ft@@ kes .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death .
the invitation was originally written in January about his best friend , and although I was sho@@ cked , I agreed .
when the day came closer , I began to fear .
so , why should I do it ?
I voted because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see directions in the US , and as often more applications are available as places available , a flaw@@ less lot@@ tery is taking place in order to decide who is chosen .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of channels from 12 to five .
who will be selected will observe it emo@@ tionally .
I cannot do that .
I would like to sit next to Richard Beh@@ avi@@ ps with which I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone numbers and two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so I will not be allowed to record a notebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me on Twitter , my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the in@@ mate , as he wants , and you get access .
I reck@@ on me with her .
she adm@@ its that she could have been better form@@ ulate , &quot; but she still thinks that it is wrong , what I do .
Richard Beh@@ sip had a problem with some of the things I have said and written .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what to write and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I said to him that he can remove me from a list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants that an international re@@ porter is present to write there .
if he dies , he thinks that the publicity work will help the death penalty against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ por@@ ter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , is seated next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts , which I have done .
I don &apos;t want to go back to all details here again .
I can not say with certainty that Richard Beh@@ sip is inno@@ cent .
his acts after the murder of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a benefici@@ ary of action .
but I believe that a strong lik@@ eli@@ hood is that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a de@@ ath@@ ist .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from that perspective I shall see him dying .
I can not claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porter to which you can turn to them .
what you will get of me is , what it means to see a man dying of an unnecessary death .

Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards were trying to put him off and threat@@ ens to finish the racing sport
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria have tried to install a sp@@ y in his stables last year and was ho@@ oked to finish the race immediately .
he pointed to the ste@@ wards and the integration department of Racing Victoria and claimed that she held a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching von Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment last straw on Wednesday .
M@@ oo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media , that he always tries to do that which is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive Kob@@ alt T@@ up@@ fer@@ ment in Li@@ dar@@ is that he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he had lasted for 18 months due to es@@ pi@@ on@@ age alleg@@ ations and did not want to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; see how to highly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hanging grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about this and I have long spoken about it , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you know that it is far @-@ going .
sometimes one respon@@ ds and one has to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to move the main target , and I want my owners think that I try my best for them .
when they start thinking , I do not , then I should not be a trainer .
I must think about what I do with my license .
previously , M@@ oo@@ dy had won the bom@@ b in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , that the full @-@ quality department had tried to sp@@ ade its barn .

they obviously believe that I am a sc@@ amm@@ ers .
if that is the case , they certainly should believe in their n@@ oses , because they try to touch myself , failed .
Robert Rou@@ li@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ z , the acting president of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ set , up @-@ to @-@ date CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at the time and are still today .
should me consider this to be considered to be personally ?
has the R@@ V@@ L che@@ ered and makes people outside of coaches responsible for what is happening in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
perhaps people think out there that I am .
maybe they must take my license and ch@@ ased me , and I have no doubt that what I am saying is to think about it now .
but I have arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter and that makes me sad .
this really makes me sad .
I will put pressure on them and pushing them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trainers rate of the coach have built up with the long @-@ term Kob@@ alt research on Li@@ dar@@ i and the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching led to that he could &quot; throw &quot; his license over the table &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

but I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my employees have irrit@@ ated mud on the leg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been this evening so .
it could have been the whole day yesterday , which was like that .
but it was so on the race day .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be faced with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the pack at the race day . an examination of this matter has been opened .
it is a joke .
people who oppose these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you go too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ am@@ y strikes about ri@@ vals for cont@@ ention dates back
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ am@@ y has critic@@ ised the Tac@@ x of his player as &quot; Agenda &quot; Set@@ ting &quot; by two Premier League favorites .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the arbitr@@ ators have allowed the Twister players &quot; E@@ Q@@ fights &quot; with his team during the high programme at the qualifying finals in Sydney on Friday evening .
drawing Bron@@ cos Trainer Wayne B@@ enn@@ ett really made a hard note about the Storm team , after his team had scored the final victory against North Queensland Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; model &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League , and said that the two Queensland wouldn &apos;t be &quot; too good &quot; in the w@@ rest@@ ling .
Bell@@ am@@ y defended the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his team and said that she is concentr@@ ating on the Tac@@ x just in her &quot; Contact . &quot;
Bell@@ am@@ y added that the criticism of two leading trainers in his team believes him confident because it was de@@ plor@@ able that they were worried about the Storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this appears on again and again - I did not hear that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about ring @-@ fights , when they took us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ am@@ y on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that throughout the year we have changed nothing at our defensive system or the techniques , but in the last six weeks we have acted to our contact in Tac@@ kl@@ es for a real emphasis and this has provided for us the trend .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years and he obviously has a great team to train . therefore , he is probably not getting acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to losing , so it was a bit of shock to him .
it is already funny as this happens again and again in this time of the year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ am@@ y has attacked the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thrilling football &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exciting football &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and his ment@@ or reminded that B@@ enn@@ ettes St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football won . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wayne speaks of thrilling football .
he compared his play on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting your game was , &quot; said Bell@@ am@@ y .
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wayne said that he will take a notice of a divor@@ ce .
but now he has a team that can play and play as exciting , especially his young players at their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play if you have these kinds of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his way of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt , so they can play how they play .
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us .
six weeks ago they probably didn &apos;t think of us than the big games went .
Bell@@ am@@ y also pointed out that the game Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ zes to co@@ w@@ boys .
the game of bronze was probably a good game , I have not seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts at our game , but is this an exciting game ?
or are Pau@@ wel@@ d making and no points a bit ten@@ sion@@ ing ?
for me it is the schedules .
if they mention , it means that we will meet in a phase nor on it .
the Twister @-@ team has free on this weekend as they have won the right to receive either North Queensland Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ k on the next Saturday night in the final final in the O@@ AMI Park . ticket sales begin on next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bi@@ er with 200,000 US refundable deposit on Dru@@ gs
a man who could potentially have a lifel@@ ong penalty within the possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine that have been mu@@ stered to Queensland , was released against a damage of 200,000 US $ .
Mar@@ ko Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the Federal Police took 100 kg of the drug on the Yacht Sol@@ ay which came from South America through Van@@ u@@ at@@ u and placed in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed how he met his fellow @-@ def@@ endants in the wake of the mor@@ nings and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era road@@ house , where the police took 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo .
despite an possibly sustained punishment for the attempt to possess a commercial amount co@@ ca@@ ine , argu@@ ing the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole lot and that in the café could have been an inno@@ cu@@ ous reason .
the judges at the Supreme Court , Peter F@@ agan , was worried about the danger of escape from Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he explained the court on Wednesday .
in the case of prosecution , he lied to the police over its place of residence .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vi@@ cs mother and Sti@@ ef@@ a had offered a security deposit of 200,000 dollars as security together to achieve its release .
&quot; after reading the aff@@ id@@ av@@ al explanations of the two persons it is clear that the edition of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; said Ju@@ agan .
but that alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from being , not to appear , warned .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released against damages , under the conditions that he sub@@ mits to the Australian and Ser@@ b Pass , open daily with the police and holding a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .

Stev@@ an ho@@ gg used phone of girls to cur@@ l pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ le to send pictures
a ped@@ ophi@@ le he used the phone of a 11 year old girl in order to challenge pictures of child abuse .
Stev@@ an Ho@@ gg took the phone of the girl , when this slept , logging in an on @-@ line mess@@ aging Service , from which he received a number of un@@ decent pictures of children who were sent to him from another user .
the girl later woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the dor@@ sal Ho@@ gg plane .
she saw it through , found the confusing messages and alert instantly to her mother .
the police took care of it and looked at the five pictures , analy@@ sing then computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; right &quot; web research , the terms used for the search for un@@ decent pictures of children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ gg conduc@@ ts it to the officials that he would have done it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then there was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ le on the internet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then there was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a police officer to be to sc@@ are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ ie Rober@@ ts@@ on said the Dun@@ de@@ e Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be a addiction that it would be addi@@ ctive to sc@@ are people .
he gave to the seeking to search on the computer from him , but said it was to happen because he wanted to claim a polic@@ eman to ble@@ w a pol@@ ophi@@ le .
he was asked for his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send more photos .
he said that he did it to enti@@ ce them .
he said he is sick in the head , when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was on the tre@@ mb@@ ling and on the wine .
she then saw the un@@ decent pictures on the phone and confron@@ t@@ ates the def@@ endants with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused computer and Play@@ station used to speak with girls who looked much younger than he did .
Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ de@@ e , officially stated in the sense of charges to have rejected un@@ decent pictures of children on 14 June last year , to have rejected the accus@@ ations and not to have appeared before a hearing at the 24th of March of this year .
Secretary General Bill S@@ im asked that Ho@@ gg does not appear in the Register of sexual perpetrators , as one could argue that &quot; no &quot; real sexual element &quot; can be found in his suspici@@ on .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael mer@@ it the judgment of October to October to obtain background information on social labour .
Ho@@ gg was granted in this case but was held for hear@@ ings in other cases in provisional custody for hear@@ ings .
he was recorded before the date of judgment into the directory of sexual perpetrators .
tro@@ user ste@@ eping on small border crossing to Germany
more and more refugees will be picked up in the Austrian border control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many tu@@ g@@ users left out of fear of discovery and arrest the men increasingly at smaller bo@@ ar@@ ders

after the re @-@ introduction of controls at the Franco @-@ Austrian border on Tuesday 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the town .
Stuttgart : working @-@ wing@@ ed of Tro@@ pen@@ ned &quot; Henry &quot; in the southwest
met@@ e@@ we@@ ologists warn of stub@@ bor@@ es in the southwest of Mit@@ tw@@ o@@ chn@@ y@@ h .
due to a low pressure area above Western Europe rivers , the German Weather Service ( D@@ W@@ D ) distributed in Stuttgart with current weather conditions ( D@@ W@@ D ) in Stuttgart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the strong field is the sp@@ urs of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; that was held over the past few days from the Ber@@ m@@ uda Islands over the Atlantic . &quot; &quot; &quot;

according to D@@ W@@ D is still until Thursday night also in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the bottom @-@ seek@@ er with Bo@@ dies of 60 to 90 St@@ ables .
the sun is going to look back for the sun again and again .
the mass makes it : every two years we show their new releases at the IA@@ A .
2015 is mainly moving to the compact car drivers that are currently particularly well sold .
cars of the comp@@ actor @-@ class are particularly asked : about 2@@ 8,@@ 1 per cent of new registrations have been ruled by the Bundes@@ amt / KBA in August alone in August .
this is also reflected in the IA@@ A ( audience &apos;s anni@@ vers@@ aries 17 to 27 September ) .
this year , between all the futur@@ istic concept autom@@ obil@@ es and new luxury cars , this year will be presented mainly a lot of new compact models .
the Opel A@@ stra is one of the largest premium for the German auto industry , which will stand at the traders in the autumn .
&quot; the A@@ stra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair .
it belongs to the heart of the brand .
in this way the volume model is also not well sold , the new A@@ stra model is not much more expensive .
Opel presents a entry below the largest ri@@ vals VW Golf in prospect , which starts at 17 650 Euros .
the current A@@ stra costs from 16 9@@ 90 Euro .
the A@@ stra has a new 1.4 liter motor with 74 kW / 100 HP .
in addition , H@@ esse offers further diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for the first time also three @-@ cylinder engines .
unlike the most important ri@@ vals of VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel A@@ stra is initially only as fifth .
as a second variant will follow in the spring of com@@ bi , which is already visible at the IA@@ A .
and what is new for new compact cars next to A@@ stra ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault wins the fourth generation of its A@@ stra cont@@ enders in the race .
the Mé@@ gan@@ e is located exclusively as a five @-@ five in a conventional and an emph@@ atic GT release .
in trade he comes the beginning of next year , then also as a com@@ bi .
Infin@@ iti : completely new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan @-@ user wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
it adap@@ ts to the compact Infin@@ iti with its curved lines fully into the design line of the brand .
the basic model will get a pet@@ rol motor with a capacity of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
however , in the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , celebrating its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1,@@ 0 @-@ liter turbine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is based upon dimensions of 170 New@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
sales start of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
Ds 4 : not completely new , but completely renewed is the compact class DS 4 which is seen at IA@@ A .
outside laid the designer of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n Ab@@ leg@@ gi especially hand at the front part : here the cooler was re@@ drawn and the changed spot@@ lights equipped with LED technology .
in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system was moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons reduced by a touch sensor and integrates for the first time Ap@@ ples Car@@ play .
in the comp@@ ac@@ class , a series of transi@@ tions and new variants were added at the IA@@ A in the comp@@ actor @-@ class or the Peugeot 3@@ 08 G@@ TI .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are deser@@ ted
the Bundes@@ verfassungs@@ gericht has announced an ex @-@ prisoner in the United Nations pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , which was accommod@@ ated per month in a small cell .
because of a violation of her human dignity , prisoners are generally entitled to financial compensation , if they are located in small cells .
this has decided the Federal Constitutional Court in a resolution on Wednesday .
however , people can even send the judges even to money if they were imprison@@ ed within a few days ( A@@ z . : 1 B@@ v@@ R 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus an ex @-@ in@@ mate was successful with his constitutional claim in Karlsruhe : he was placed in the alignment Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel in June and November 2009 in a single cell of approximately five square meters of ground floor ; the toilet was still not dis@@ connected .
after that , the man who , according to his banker , meanwhile moved on an open walk , had moved into a larger cell .
his term ru@@ th@@ iness due to the un@@ worthy of detention against the land of Berlin d@@ anced .
however , the Constitutional Ju@@ dge took the judgment of the Chamber of Chamber Berlin and rejected the case for renewed testing .
you see the human dignity of the man .
Chamber of exter@@ mination now decide on the amount of compensation
even if for legal reasons a few days of liability for compensation , if only a few days of prison for compensation , be an appeals , it was called .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; failure of the judicial protection of the personality would be to be feared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chamber court must now clarify the amount of money damage .
the Constitutional Ju@@ dge in the past often have often strengthened the rights of prisoners .
thus they did not speak until in April one prisoner release , because he was naked in a cell naked .
human un@@ worthy is a decision of 2011 as well as the multi@@ purpose of a cell without separate toilet .
Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court to establish an un@@ in@@ decent accommodation in November 2009 in a parallel case in November 2009 .
the then Kl@@ äger was reached on a daily basis between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
the Berlin pr@@ isons were brought in the head@@ lines in the past few weeks as well .
cap@@ tives are therefore always included 23 hours , the aggressi@@ veness increasing , even to bat , it should have been already because of its tense situation .
according to information from the pi@@ vot@@ al press@@ ors , 21 places in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of the offspring , 19 they shall fall away .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we create the &quot;
the immigration of refugees is a tremendous challenge - the Chancellor is decided to accept her .
what is coming to Germany ?
around 800 000 asylum seekers , according to forecasts of the Federal Ministry of Culture this year , Germany , following statement by vice @-@ Chancellor , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to accommodate a million refugees .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated with the unusual challenge : &quot; I say again and again : we can create it , and we will create it . &quot;
what on Germany comes , gives the following overview .
it is needed for different forecasts between 3@@ 50@@ 000 ( estim@@ ation of the Federal Ministry of Ministry ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estim@@ ation of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments annually , and the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it is built ( 250@@ ,000 apartments ) .
dramatic is the lack of living space but above all for paid properties : 60@@ ,000 to 80@@ ,000 social housing are included out of the rent , and in this very favorable apartment , they will also apply for refugees .
Bundes@@ bau@@ ster@@ in Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) therefore aims to double the promotion , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing annually have to be created and therefore the federal government would have to invest 6.@@ 4 billion a year .
the scientists and the Federal Minister of federal mini@@ stries in the agreed that there must also be more tax benefits for investments in housing construction .
according to the estimates of the Institute for labor market and professional research , it is expected to be 55 percent of the refugees in Germany over the long term .
however , the refugees in Germany would not be questioned systematically according to their qualifications in order to help them with the introduction of critic@@ ised , Claudia Walter , the manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann foundation .
but for the integration of refugees however it is crucial to find a job in Germany .
work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the reception society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of the migrants , &quot; migration researchers , De Thr@@ es@@ hardt .
according to the throne , there was a political transition in Germany : from employment ban for refugees to recognition work .
while there was an employment ban for asylum seekers , up to five years ago , this period was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the residences to host asylum seekers .
in society even because of the qualified labour of qualified labour - majority , the view has prevailed , that refugees should be enabled to access the labour market more quickly .
a large obstacle for access to the labour market have been a lack of German knowledge .
until now , there is no special offer of general and occupation @-@ related voice courses .
studies also show that jobs are most often im@@ par@@ ted by personal contacts .
the construction of networks is therefore suitable for the opinion of Thr@@ u@@ hardt of the Royal Road to the sin@@ tegr@@ ation .
the Berlin school administration has found that few fle@@ eting parents give their children to the kids , approximately ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the root @-@ rooted parents it is only once very important to hold the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ zy@@ bar , speaker for the youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration .
to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , distri@@ butes the management manual in different languages .
if the need for educ@@ ators strongly increase the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would attempt to increase the training capacity - approximately , by re@@ trained more specialized schools .
in the countries children are prepared without German knowledge in welcome classes .
however , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers and teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage , says Be@@ ate St@@ ations by the Berlin school administration .
the German Stud@@ enten@@ werk appreci@@ ates that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany .
in principle no federal state asylum or thr@@ ong the study - the only exception was in Berlin , internal sen@@ ator Frank H@@ enkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned its position .
study @-@ willing refugees could be facilitated by access to the university .
because refugees with a residence permit or th@@ ief are not given any performances after the asylum application , if they start studying .
the latter , as a matter of principle , no BA@@ Fö@@ G , since they do not fall under the circle of the b@@ af@@ ants .
tolerated refugees had to be lived in Germany for four years so as to be eligible to BA@@ Fö@@ G , from 1st January 2016 , this gap has been shortened to 15 months .
but this financing is also to be closed , St@@ effen Kra@@ ch , Ber@@ lins State Secretary for Science , and the German Stud@@ enten@@ werk .
students should immediately get up to BA@@ Fö@@ G .
Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims and for many , religion is more important part of their identity .
the state should su@@ pr@@ one the same rights to Islam as they have the churches , and the existing state churches have the right to develop a new state @-@ religion ratio .
the foundation of a Islamic welfare state would be professionally concerned with new@@ com@@ ers .
the rights also belong to obligations .
thus the representative of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be prepared to co @-@ operate with the state in many areas and lay certain possibilities of control .
that is also the willingness to stand up against religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Central Works of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ es , vo@@ iced on Thursday the concern , religious conflicts may also be transferred to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who have planned such conflicts in Germany have immediately got their right to stay here in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ rische ischer Rund@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law on Arabic .
in future , integration will be much more than today a topic of the entire society .
in doing so , the majority of society will have to change , the exploitation of discrimination and racism will be more pressing .
Germany - as a result of European decisions - has been a anti @-@ discrimination organization and a general equality law since the last decade .
but it learns very slowly , as the NS@@ U @-@ murder @-@ series showed , in the police and authorities the rac@@ ist moti@@ f systematically ignored .
equal opportunities for all : what migrants &quot; organizations and stak@@ eholder groups are asking for long and why international agreements such as anti @-@ racial conflicts in Germany have to become a reality in the coming years , if the country will remain peaceful and its new citizens are to use their facilities - for the benefit of all .
generally speaking , Germany is capable of supplying the expected refugees to date , means the doctor @-@ president Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what concerns Man@@ - Power and capacities , we create that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however that money does not need to flow into the system .
to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery , all grants immediately on the registration of health cards .
provided services could be expected later with the Bundes@@ länder .
and in the long run it is highly question@@ able , so many people are able to conc@@ ede with the limited potential to obtain the Asyl@@ um Performance Act .
otherwise , the doctors make above all the language barriers to create .
even so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven to be worse about their diseases as other patients .
not only in clinics , also in doctors , would have to pay interpreter costs , she asks her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this would help many refugees but also with more common medical lead @-@ lead in the case of emergency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and with a different diagnostic view .
under refugee centres , for instance , there are much more un@@ treated people and with young people it is about HIV @-@ enlightenment .
with the partly other medical paintings , German doctors were from their apprenticeship , but clear , stands Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite or tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis are not so difficult to recognize , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and what affects the nu@@ is@@ ance , whether through the refugees or even alle@@ vi@@ ate relief in sight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syri@@ ans have a highly developed educational system , some refugees or even doctors .
in order to practice , however , they must show their qualifications and may take part again .
at least half of the refugees coming over in Germany is after estimates of the bund@@ esp@@ an therapy ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) psych@@ ically sick : most suffer from a post @-@ traum@@ atic pay@@ load or under depression .
specially hur@@ ried were refugee camps , says Dietrich Mun@@ z , president of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recent study by the TU München shows that every fifth of Syrian camps are trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany arrives .
those who suffer from a post @-@ traum@@ atic load trouble is suffering from other things using Flas@@ h@@ backs with breathing @-@ not , di@@ zz@@ iness , du@@ ms and death @-@ fear@@ ing .
further symptoms are sleeping @-@ and concentr@@ ating disorders , strong ch@@ at@@ eness and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
to prevent that symptoms would be chronic , be an early treatment necessary , explained Mun@@ z .
so far there are only four percent of the psych@@ ic sick refugees trying to psychotherapy .
indeed , psych@@ ically sick people @-@ seekers in the social offices may provide a request for psychotherapy but it usually takes several months to process .
in addition , in the social offices , mostly Sax@@ workers or doctors , who are not trained in the mental illness , decide whether treatment is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ estim@@ ation , says Mun@@ z .

Sim@@ bab@@ w@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe keeps a false speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa oldest guide , fell down at the start of the year from a podium down the stairs .
he remained und@@ un@@ ted , but the video of the fall quickly spread over social media .
the opening of the parliament was also rec@@ alled by claims of members of the opposition that they would have received anonymous death threats and warned against it to accompany the address by Mr Mu@@ gabe with bu@@ hr@@ ine .
in the last month they had booked him and received him during his talk about the situation of the nation in parliament - this is the speech which he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man of the movement for democratic change ( Movement for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ esis said that seven Op@@ positions @-@ politicians SMS messages are received on their phones they previously warned , Mr. Mu@@ gab@@ it approach .
&quot; the news comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , he said journalists to Mu@@ en@@ es speech .
it war@@ ns the affected parliament members that their immunity are in the Parliament and once they leave the Parliament , their parliamentary immunity are no longer effective .
Chief Executive Officer said that from Morgan Ts@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i was &quot; concerned &quot; about the dangers of the politicians .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will accommodate up to 30,000 jobs
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to dismant@@ le 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the framework of corporate restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services .
HP will later share in two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast growing company hardware and service activities .
the expected job expansion will lead to a burden of more than 2,@@ 7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , HP said in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this restructuring measures will allow a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chairman and Chief Executive , who is to guide the unity after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and stronger than it is HP today and we have a broad and extensive portfolio of businesses that support companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than 50 billion US pro forma revenue and is thus to be concentrated on providing an integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; such an explanation of the company .
it shares a company that was founded by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard in order to establish electric systems and their Palo Alto Garage is called &quot; the birth@@ place of the Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has a massive restructuring process to overcome the return of traditional PCs towards mobile devices .
the HP , the second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this area that is based on conviction that closely focused companies perform better performance .
FC Arsenal @-@ captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that teamwork is before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger emphas@@ ised to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it is only September and provided his rehabilitation after the plan , there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario actually means that Wil@@ lem won for at least the next four games for England and in view of its history , his participation in the next summer will certainly still be uncertain .
the big shame on this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had exhausted the last season after a separate released breach and then returned to its old swing during the pres@@ eas@@ on .
&quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten the career , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it is a bone , which is not well cur@@ led .
this is not a major matter .
this was just an accident .
it was not related to his kn@@ u@@ ds or with the injury that he had before .
this may be true from purely medical point of view , but like man@@ ger , it gives the associated danger of other injuries , always when a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops a uncomfortable pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut of six years ago .
he also played in just 65 by Ar@@ sen@@ als 157 Lig@@ asp@@ ts in the last five seasons .
the wider picture for ar@@ senal is that they have been in six out of eight game times since 2007 / 08 one of the two Premier League clubs that have received most viol@@ ins .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a devil @-@ circle , but ar@@ senal believes that an improvement in the injury value will last throughout the last season .
&quot; sometimes , when you come back from an injury , you have a prolonged period of time , a time in which you must strengthen your body and win combat strength , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will have a career of the way he deserves .
ar@@ senal starts its Champions League season on Wednesday night against Din@@ amo Zagreb before the Games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ track next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger provides a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ ctor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , which means that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta is starting to start .
Wen@@ ger can also begin with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ ro@@ ud instead of Post@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; I try to keep up the balance and give up the players who need it to give a short break @-@ up , &quot; says Wen@@ ger .
although Arsenal in clear favour@@ ites are to move through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir &apos;s stadium in Zagreb belongs to the play@@ grounds with the largest intim@@ id@@ ation effect in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign launched in the last season .
the stadium was sha@@ ken on Tuesday night by an earthquake , where the set @-@ scale 3.@@ 2 was measured .
this year it was the 10th place in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger is the opinion that ar@@ senal has attracted the doctrine of past season with the Champions League of capit@@ ulation against Monaco and will remain from far @-@ far@@ away hope to lead the association to its first Europ@@ ap@@ ocal@@ al triumph .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it has never worked when an ar@@ senal .
we were very close in 2006 but on the other hand I am long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dream@@ ers .
Friend@@ s@@ celebration : the com@@ edy show , who gave us serious lessons on men friend@@ ships
the absence of similar representations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open themselves , now more des@@ perate as ever before , as su@@ icide is prove under young men at a 15 @-@ year high .
in 2013 it was the most important de@@ pot in men aged 20 to 45 in Britain , and it remains more common in men than women .
in an effort to address the issue , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ ope ( CA@@ LM - campaign against a erb@@ ated life ) 2015 when the year of the man , with the aim of asking the culture to ask for help if they need them .
friendship is the heart of fighting this challenge .
a recent study with more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms fixed that when the suff@@ erer had a enough high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood &quot; re@@ doubled its chances of recovery .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , hal@@ ved a circle of mental healthy friends the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends first , so that a friendship can work .
in the age of more than social media , communication , focusing on style about substance , is often more important than an important contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear greatly , life @-@ consuming and successful , even though in reality dominates the isolation .
this superf@@ icial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologist extr@@ trin@@ sic values , money , image , social status , everything on costs in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship , which affects our mental health much deeper .
and as a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really not buy .
the Beautiful at Friends was that these focus on the head was put .
every character was not defined by his labor , but by his personality , which g@@ lows through the interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ our of jo@@ ey and ch@@ and@@ ler accumulation of hu@@ gs , moments in the foot@@ wear and the longing of R@@ oss to Rachel - all that came from the knowledge that men can refer to each case , even if they often go back , fully explore their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an employee of the telephone soul said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my assignment for people who feel de@@ pressed and vulnerable to me , has shown me really clearly how even the smallest interactions between friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often don &apos;t feel able to talk with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old phrase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cope with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect on how the feeling that it is perceived as weakness if you talk about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Friends is one of the shows that come in mind to me if I try to offer long @-@ term loading mechanisms .
it clearly presents the little moments of men friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ si@@ ders on the phone to help people in moments of despair may also help the long term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you visit this weekend of com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ celebration with the celebration of the day completely new , why not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or even better , if you see someone alone in Star@@ bu@@ cks alone , give him a smile and say hello to him .
one never knows what the difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent at Com@@ edy Central from beginning to end - the entire 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria arrives to help PS@@ G to rent Malmö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani , following his matches on Malmö .
di Maria arrives at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass on Malmö .
here are the Game Report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held course in Paris Saint @-@ Germain becoming the Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 battle against Malmö in Prin@@ zen@@ Play stadium of Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after starting his Champions League &apos;s debut as PS@@ G player , who brought the French Master to the way , but after that they missed a series of occasions before they finally lifted up their lead , when Cav@@ ani achieved a head office in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with real Madrid and chess ch@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in group A needs Paris a strong start against the Swedish champion , since they had not just finished the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter @-@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points it was not a class@@ y run by Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vi@@ cs right before the gate . he later became at stake against his hom@@ etown team and against the association , with which he began his illustr@@ ative career in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or back in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 , to cause our opponents issues and relaxed , even if there are certain things we have to perf@@ ected in the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we didn &apos;t have left one or two more doors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I@@ dr@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , holding an 2 : 2 oun@@ ces on their own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was replaced by Di Maria in the fourth minute .
the Argent@@ inian wings became known as the man , who can take over the PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe , and he clari@@ fies why , when he entered into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis passport behind the Malmö defense , before he plan@@ ed to Johan Wil@@ and passed nicely in the long corner of the net .
however , if any one believed that PS@@ G would win a great win he was disappointed .
Malmö found the Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach this level , stood at An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was a five @-@ man defense and two deep positioned in the middle area a heavy opponent .
but besides a kiss from Nikola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who went far to Kevin Tr@@ á P@@ fo@@ sten at the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead PS@@ G even went on , with some failures and poor results , not least by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , who was abandoned at no less than five attempts alone in the first half and then after that Cav@@ ani had asked him after re@@ boot .
nevertheless he pointed out much more skill , when he brought his fellow @-@ players into the game , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , turned the Di Maria into a shoot which was passing by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the P@@ fo@@ sten ...
the second gate finally fell short after the hour brand thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Uruguay ay@@ man achieved his sixth season , after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic had caught a left f@@ lange of Max@@ well .
that ended up all the thoughts that Malmö could return to the game , and only an outstanding entry of Wil@@ and from recent distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , the end result could be low before the replacement player E@@ ze@@ qu@@ iel Lav@@ e@@ zzi has detected a gate at the end .
the trainer of Malmö , Age Har@@ den , announced later that PS@@ G has played a class over his team , and the Norwegian said , &quot; our last Champions League game was in December last year .
since then , we have only played in the Swedish league who did not have the same level .
the qualification rounds are not enough . &quot;
hut in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ avi : PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola prevented 2008 Change to FC Bayern
world and Europ@@ am@@ ei@@ ster X@@ avi , since summer 2015 played for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar
the FC Bayern stood obviously prior to the commitment of Spain super@@ star X@@ avi , who played at that time for FC Barcelona .
eight times more Spanish Masters , three times champion league winner , two times the club champion , two times Europ@@ am@@ ei@@ ster , one time World Champion - the title @-@ list of X@@ avi is breathtaking .

&quot; they told me that Bar@@ ça would like to sell me . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid gained everything , we did nothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he tells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the registered share of the FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ s wanted to have me . &quot;

X@@ avi declares why : &quot; Bar@@ ça has taken the gu@@ ardi@@ ola under contract and I played a great EM . &quot;
&quot; PE@@ P has said to me that I wouldn &apos;t change the team without me . &quot;
&quot; so that he has taken me . &quot;

during a series of Sunday Night of H@@ B@@ OS Project Green@@ light l@@ ends the experienced actor Brown , when this stressed the need for alternative perspectives , while in terms of a black prot@@ ag@@ onists in the selected screen@@ play of the project .
&quot; if we talk about diversity then you do it in the occupation of the movie and not in the occupation of the show , &quot; insured Dam@@ on . &quot;
brown re@@ acted by sho@@ cked with bel@@ lows and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! WO@@ W . okay , &quot; when the comments of the act@@ ress from The Mar@@ tian &apos;s stolen .
Dam@@ on and Brown sat at producing Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss about the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to ask people to think about it - who will still be the director - as she says the figure of Harmony , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person and she is a sp@@ line that gets be@@ aten from her white tri@@ umph@@ s .
the producer of De@@ ar White People has sat down for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for the direc@@ ting rights to the film ; Dam@@ on reb@@ elled that their Reg@@ ie &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;

the T@@ we@@ et earned more than 5.000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 Li@@ kes since its publication .

and I think that Isaac could have felt right when playing the roles .

Detroit Tig@@ ers sli@@ ces to Minnesota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not especially funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
formerly they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers are standing on the last place in the American League Central .
the Tig@@ ers reduced to their role as spo@@ ilers , however , they played a part in Tuesday perfectly against Minnesota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in Tar@@ get Field .
the T@@ wins hat@@ s a chance to climb within a player &apos;s side of Houston , to the second American league game .
for Detroit , even if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F word that was so hard to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all victories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Sel@@ m .
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon held its early offensive support , when Detroit was dot@@ ted three times in the first two to@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then once in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) struck 6 times on 1 / 3 within the 1 / 3 and made possible three r@@ ens .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year greatly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is difficult to throw at the bull@@ whi@@ stle of each game , and so I want to go quite focused in the game .
the design@@ ate tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ us , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ hit game from Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had played four hits against the Seattle of Marin@@ ers on July 6 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has pushed the drums well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Un@@ m . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at ( stroke training ) , looked clearly better in the bull@@ sh@@ es , and he brought it directly into the game .
with three kn@@ itting at the end of the seventh interior , the T@@ wins had its best chance to get back into play .
center Fiel@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton , Byr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton completed the inning with a double on the left field of the field .
by Right , the Aaron H@@ icks reached a p@@ unt , and Simon gave his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ cian to Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ins Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy came to the wall , the only man to confront before the design@@ ate R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ stroke Miguel S@@ ano , who has a two @-@ run barrel v@@ ows a Two @-@ Run .
with a pair of runners and the completion @-@ run at the second carried out the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play .
it was the 27th time the Major League winning the 27th time this season that Pl@@ ou@@ sts hit a double play
after Detroit added an Insurance Company at the end of the ninth day , the Wall managed a R@@ BI Award against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don , and recorded the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
however , the handed @-@ handed sla@@ p however S@@ ano at three Pit@@ ches for its fifth Save .
Detroit prof@@ ited to the end of the game of one still non @-@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the tiger attained three r@@ uns in the first two inner ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , which had been cancelled before the game from the injury @-@ list , after he was missing more than a month for a back @-@ suffering .
&quot; obviously , not the beginning I wanted , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt comfor@@ ting when I started and feeling that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches da in the third inning . &quot;
after she received the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ man during the first the Le@@ ad@@ off , Hus@@ hai gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a Two @-@ Out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z , who created a single &quot; up the Middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 track series with the Run@@ ners in the Scor@@ ing position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos was followed with a single on the right , managed a further run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to go to the third which the threat ended .
the Tig@@ ers placed in the second to get a one @-@ out double of Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single of Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony G@@ osis to the 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; that was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did not particularly well be@@ aten but he got the right place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
hor@@ gh@@ es found himself in a pitch @-@ count , did not generate points in the third inning before being replaced by the rel@@ ie@@ ver right @-@ handed man @-@ handed .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there came to three screens with six hits and a walk with four cor@@ ke@@ ying outs .

hundreds of refugees should get in Wiesbaden
a train that of hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
those in them are then to be accommod@@ ated in emergency accommodations in Wiesbaden , like the city of Wiesbaden , in July .
it calculated with a 450 to 750 incoming refugees .
several sports halls of the Hes@@ sian provincial capital had been prepared for this case over the past few days .
up to 1000 refugees can occur there .
they shall then be distributed to other municipalities .
alone in the last ten days , according to the participation of the participation of the government , G@@ ießen 7@@ 500 people had arrived in Hessen .

Ischgl : German military measures to be an option in Syria
the director of the Munich Security conference , Wolfgang St@@ inger , holding military action with German participation in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think the deci@@ de@@ dly thinking about military action options may not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he threw the European states in a collective country . &quot;
four years ago one was happy that the cup has gone by a military involvement in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict has collap@@ sing on our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutsch@@ land@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Austria is controlled at southern and eastern borders
after Germany , Austria has again introduced controls to its southern and eastern borders .
the Austrian Interior of Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner declared on the Tuesday evening in the Austrian broad@@ casting station , according to Hungary , there will be no one now .
also Germany have sent no refugees to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , that is so agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
concerning an agreement , after which Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said , there was already applicable discussions between the Director @-@ General for public security and representatives of Germany .
concrete numbers called it and dis@@ missed the talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
in the last days , tens of thousands of refugees came across the so called Balkan route from Hungary to Austria .
their destination is mostly Germany .
chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann had an extraordinary summit on next week with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had begun on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU states have not yet been able to agree on common action in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EU &apos;s interior ministers will want to take a new resume on the binding distribution of further 120 000 refugees on Tuesday ( 22 September ) .
given the strong refugee camp in Germany , the federal government wants to support the states more strongly in the initial intake and distribution of the people .
the federal government will manage this in cooperation with the countries , Angela Merkel , in the late April evening , following almost four consultation with the Prime Minister in the Office of the Federal Chancell@@ ery in Berlin .
Merkel underlined , those people who smo@@ other the protection , be@@ wil@@ dered this too .
but whoever does not have a lead @-@ eye view can not remain in Germany .
this view was issued in the round of impressive number .
the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed , the state as a whole must now cope with a &quot; enormous force of force . &quot;
thousands of des@@ perate refugees now move firmly on the channel route .
Hungary closed its 175 kilometres long border with Serbia on the night of Tuesday .
a few hours later the government announced in Budapest to link the border to Romania with a fence .
this neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU .

the Romanian government condemned the plan immediately .
there was first ar@@ rests of people who had inter@@ sec@@ ted the fence .

the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; journal .
already longer was known that there must be some water under the ice ceiling of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is very difficult for us to make R@@ ama a her@@ ber loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course we have to think &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Sport@@ s@@ tor Nec@@ at Ay@@ ben@@ n the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; picture &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper with a view to the possible obligation of a unified professionals . &quot; &quot; &quot;

man@@ goes are exotic and ju@@ icy sweet .
but whoever wants to watch out on his sl@@ ender line is often rather dis@@ coura@@ ged .
for man@@ goes contain relatively much sugar , especially Sac@@ char@@ ose .
healthy are the exotic fruits still : in them are B vitamins , as well as vitamins E and C. In particular they contain man@@ goes but plenty of vitamin A and its pre@@ amplifier beta @-@ car@@ ot@@ ene .

when buying , Man@@ gos should not be too soft or too solid and smell .
the colour @-@ color alone does not say anything about how mature the fruit is - so also green man@@ goes also taste delicious .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then they taste naturally pure or sweet food .

Rome now has a Martin Luther &apos;s Square
just under 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther &apos;s place in Rome .
in the presence of the city President Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino on Wednesday there was a so far nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill to the name of the German Re@@ verse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he is now honoured as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German The@@ ologi@@ an &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park is located right in the middle of Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ seum .
the naming was filed by the Labor Association of the protest@@ ant churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that the Protest@@ ants could live in the City of the Pop@@ es over centuries as a minority , often only in conce@@ al@@ ment their faith .
in symbo@@ lic@@ ally , I become visible in a prime manner that her tradition of Christian faith is welcome to Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was held as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k for the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 for a few months in Rome .
he received the city back then than in a s@@ inner .
his negative impressions gives rise to historians in his later fight against Rome .
Martin had then initiated his theses against the rejected by the division of the Icel@@ an@@ dic church .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( g@@ ild@@ ed ) Dor@@ nen@@ kr@@ one is one of the main works , the Ot@@ mar Alt in his Bible has painted .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and the Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not with the Ot@@ t @-@ Old Bible , which now has been published with splendid pictures .
in the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated in 150 moti@@ fs his very personal interpre@@ tations of biblical stories on paper and canvas .
his &quot; language , &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative shapes have received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - which is by no means equal to &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
on the contrary : the respective topics are adapted , this can be quite dark .
&quot; &quot; &quot; about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his Bible project for which he made a subjective conscious artistic choice from the many thematic areas of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; books of all books . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following are cycles , which devote themselves to themes such as cross@@ roads , pe@@ pl@@ agues , commandments or pat@@ ernity .
spontane@@ ously , he was immediately fascinated with several partners : this applies to the Luther &apos;s publishing house with his the@@ ological outlook as well as for the Kettler publishing house with his main focus on art books .
and in particular the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who tac@@ kl@@ ed himself on the basis of painting with the respective Bible locations .
he has interpreted the recent Bible and so into today , translated into current coher@@ encies . &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirror of aluminum painting .
it is embedded between Martin Luther &apos;s original Bible from Martin Luther and one of the artist &apos;s sentence , who was formulated here his very personal thoughts about the particular situation .
the jewelry box has Golden Let@@ ters .
thus the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows double insight into his soul , its emotions .
it is a high level of intimacy .
emotions were ultimately been a trigger for the bi@@ ble project : Ot@@ mar Alt , 1940 born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and raised in Berlin , comes from a family who listened to the strict Protestant reign of swe@@ ar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there the education came already with the pi@@ ke &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; re@@ members Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to work on the way , in order to be able to carry me with the Lord even again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern was to re@@ generate art in a quick@@ est time : &quot; the perception of images is today shaped by re@@ kl@@ ame , and which is loud .
symbol@@ ism is being displ@@ aced
artists have another desire and glad@@ ness , showing things .
pictures have always something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a dinosau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt want to let the spect@@ ator come into the pictures &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hung out , discover and feel the force you have : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture seeks its counter@@ part . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , and on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , has always been &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Art : &quot; I like how he understands life with his pictures . &quot;
old did not allow to grasp the Bible completely , but the mysteries for him are also important , even mysterious matters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was no co @-@ operation on eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about the pictures , the text merely explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be a images @-@ Bible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans Mö@@ h@@ ler from Luther &apos;s publishing house , this work has an invitation to deepen his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ mighty pictures speak for Mö@@ h@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and responsibility .
a section of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas Pr@@ ints - is presented for the first time in an exhibition that will be opened on 15th November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation .
pre @-@ production for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn
plans have been found , position found , corporations have been commissioned to model Earth She@@ ets for a circuit : a year later everything was ready - but still before the official opening of the BM@@ X train was already at the end .
om@@ is@@ sions in politics and administration over@@ looked for em@@ bo@@ dying , especially amongst the residents who did not tolerate the fact .
thus hills made up , new place searched for - now with a formal planning and application for building permit .
the authorization will go in October , the first comm@@ ent@@ ations of Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was now disclosed in the Children &apos;s and Youth Committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year more obvious , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should be started without &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another commem@@ oration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the work at the former indoor pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ P intensified engagement for refugees
the DF@@ B is expanding its commitment to refugees to 2019 , the Bundesliga will re@@ comp@@ action a clear sign in the weekend .
the football re@@ acts to the p@@ inion situation in Germany and secur@@ es its policies to cope with the problems facing the upcoming problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I consider that the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there can no man say in principle , that doesn &apos;t matter , I have nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this has to be interesting for everyone to get this topic under control , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B director Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m next Wednesday in the office of the office and the Minister of State of Mrs Ö@@ zo@@ j@@ ha@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the topic will certainly play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the football can and wants to help .
but the decisive factor must be put to politics .
the German Football Association has therefore extended its refugee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; four years .
&quot; over the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us Braun Stiftung we ensured that this programme is run until 2019 , &quot; stated Ni@@ ers@@ bach on the edge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
also some states support this program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already this weekend we put the 36 pro@@ nov@@ a clear sign if they are on the left tri@@ kot@@ ary instead of the otherwise usual sponsorship ( Her@@ mes ) the imprint &quot; We will help &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that all and how they can only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lever@@ k@@ ens Sport@@ i Fi@@ é of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; picture &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and drew the project as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ course &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee @-@ drama will definitely go away , nobody can see it away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want football tra@@ gi@@ sts , no , we have to use our radi@@ ance , our influence and opportunities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ offen@@ hei@@ ms Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent banner of the League . &quot;
to the EM qualification play against Hungary this Friday , the national team of women invited 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach negotiated the support of refugees as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; large community &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German football &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 licensing agreements have started in their locations , be great .
just as great is that small and smallest associations are active .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who we spent is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said .
this year the association provides for the integration of refugees with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government with 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees .
&quot; the clubs have already announced the whole amount for 2015 , &quot; reported Ni@@ ers@@ bach .
reports : SAP R@@ att@@ ers lose an eye at the accident
the head of head of Europe &apos;s biggest software company , Bill M@@ der@@ mot@@ t , has lost several reports , according to a fall in early July the left eye .
at the accident on the staircase in the House of his brother in the USA he fell after midnight on a water glass , which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; Economic Area &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; he is almost ble@@ ached , was power@@ less , then moved out into the street - that he told us so last week , &quot; named the &quot; Wi@@ der &quot; SAP co @-@ founder of H@@ asso plate .
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could prove his work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in early October we meet before the supervisory board in Wall@@ dorf &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Plat@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; old managers were in the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; out@@ fit &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thurs@@ days ) , he will come back to Germany in October and continue to run the software concerts .
&quot; I am full for SAP so , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course I was faced with the Supervisory Board all the time in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t acts usually between Germany and the US , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important is to stand up again if you noticed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren replacement pilot magn@@ us@@ sen besides skir@@ mish ...
Magn@@ us@@ sen t@@ wit@@ ter@@ te is similar to the photo and explained that he suffered injuries , when he was over@@ thrown by the wheel .
he therefore comes a little as a reservoir for the two equi@@ vocal Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button in@@ god , like a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , we cannot rely on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ck@@ les on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether it will be back again on Sunday in the Bundesliga team against Lever@@ k@@ usen , the BV@@ B @-@ coach was open again : &quot; we expect a return from it to training on Friday . &quot;
given the high load of its pros , Tu@@ ck@@ les will not only change pro@@ genit@@ f position on the rec@@ umbent position .
so he announced a change on the door@@ ke@@ eper .
therefore Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of stem ke@@ eper Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; he exercises on an absolute top level , &quot; praised the football teacher the world Master .
whether the Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller arrives in future in all Europe @-@ league games , however , tu@@ ck@@ les left us open .
with a high degree of probability he will pun@@ ish the second game .
the for@@ ged statement by fellow players Re@@ us that the final gain for BV@@ B in the European League will have to be the target , holds mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian W@@ eig@@ l for trac@@ eable : &quot; hence Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
&quot; I think we have a good chance to grasp the title . &quot;
Robot@@ er@@ au@@ tos : government wants at the cutting edge for Germany
Germany shall be pioneer under the will of the German government on the change in the cars of technological development .
the cabinet was decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which provides for example investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the I@@ esse IA@@ A from a &quot; new mobility era . &quot;
the automated and networked drive will increase traffic safety and provide for less steel , &quot; said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t .
he wants to discuss the subject with his counter@@ part from the G@@ 7 states , which come together with representatives from the industry at the IA@@ A .
the Concept Paper of the Ministry of Ministry is underlined among other things the importance of mobile broad@@ band installation and a quick entry to digital radio .
the testing of new technology currently arises a test track on the 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order to allow the driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability @-@ risk management &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the federal government wants to check the legal framework , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and where necessary to adapt to new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Germany wants to employ roughly international to ensure the permissible maximum speed for self @-@ driving cars from 10 to 130 h per hour is raised .
the German government wants to work for a change in the Vienna Convention which so far only sees the people as a driver .
when driving driving , the car takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger .
the technology is primarily based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , the study of highly automated driving will be technically feasible by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , vehicles are expected to expect &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; public roads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the value creation in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the site Germany value the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to around 8,@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; the digital connectivity of the P@@ k@@ ws can lead to greater security and efficiency in traffic , &quot; the SPD &apos;s SPD &apos;s economic policy said , &quot; said Bart@@ ol .
but the question of liability in accidents and the security of the personal data of the drivers must be clari@@ fied .
still the Germans are still skep@@ tical but far more than the French or Americans .
one on Wednesday at the AA pre @-@ study by the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the test organization DE@@ K@@ RA comes to the result that only eight percent of the Germans believe that self @-@ driven cars will continue to prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent in the last 20 years , 31 percent do not believe in it at all .
in France 21 percent of respon@@ dents rep@@ lied by 20@@ 25 with aut@@ os@@ om@@ iting cars , in the US 33 percent .
in case the drivers in Germany are not ready to leave themselves completely on a self @-@ driving vehicle .
according to a digital screen shot , only seven per cent would be able to approve the control during the entire trip on all roads .
on the highway that could barely imagine 15 per cent in flowing transport , at St@@ au 45 per cent .
well each Fourth would leave the car under no circumstances to the car .
B@@ oll says team@@ - and double start at Table Tennis @-@ EM
the Düssel@@ dor@@ fer wants to stand according to current status at the title of the title from September 25 to October 4 only in single single session .
the final decision should be handed down on September 22 at the latest .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the guys have experienced it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough , even without Tim@@ o the title , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bundestag &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Mr Ro@@ ß@@ ner during the EM @-@ Doc@@ s in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this case , B@@ oll was based on the flight into a long @-@ term agreed sponsorship min in China .
the 34 year old German champion is expected on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Tim@@ o , the draw@@ back , we are now no longer as a clear favorite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared single @-@ Europ@@ am@@ ei@@ ster Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who carries the S@@ etz@@ ist in J@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , reminded me of the EM 2013 in Sch@@ altern@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , Tim@@ o has also been missing and we are Europ@@ am@@ ei@@ ster . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

gau@@ l@@ tier is too old for an En@@ f@@ ant
it is a mix of very large vari@@ ance and a wa@@ al figur@@ ine . the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on Wednesday in Munich at the show .
the highlights : man@@ nequins , which also looks great thanks to video proj@@ ections .
they wear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who is among other things with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits to the great star of the fashion scene - and therefore that he put up men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant , the Haute C@@ out@@ ure , because I had white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; earlier it was very easy , now it &apos;s real , &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
for visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( V@@ om Citiz@@ enship on the cat@@ walk ) , which is visible from the 18th of September at the Kuns@@ thalle in the H@@ Y@@ PO @-@ Kulturstiftung , it is a fortunate that the Mo@@ des@@ ch@@ ö@@ pfer has changed his beginning to a show about his personality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , he was against it , because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me sounded , an exhibition a little after death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you come to the museum .
the impressive collection was previously made in the Canadian Montreal and in Paris .
&quot; it is so much more than just beautiful clothes , &quot; the director of the Kuns@@ thalle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren .
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into that hardly ever @-@ looking work of the man , the fashion story , without ever having completed an education .
chron@@ ologically the show is not built , but it is a beautifully choreo@@ graphic work artwork , which was operated for much effort : to fr@@ ise the dolls , for example , a sty@@ list is engaged .
14 tons of material have turned according to the indications of the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich .
just before the start of the Oktober@@ fest was a special ch@@ man@@ t with it : a leather tro@@ user out@@ fit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
he was always interested in strong women ( &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
also gau@@ l@@ ous old Ted@@ dy is visible in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , z@@ agr@@ j@@ o@@ dic glimp@@ ses of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and poorly dressed in football ) , he was attracted to his Ted@@ dy &apos;s and clothes , said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
to play with a doll , his parents would not have allowed him .
he did not throw himself from fashion to self .
he sto@@ cking mo@@ de@@ writings and saw the designs of other designers , just like Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich .
but I bought this one later .
he will not be able to pay the mod@@ els for his first own look .
they got nothing but were allowed to keep the clothes ...
jewelry instead of sheer sheer top than fashion niche
it used to go to the long embro@@ ider@@ y machines in and around Pl@@ auen .
the embro@@ i@@ dered substances and Spit@@ z emerged in a large amount for customers who are further elabor@@ ated in blankets and she@@ ers .
this alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of Mo@@ vers Pl@@ auen .
instead the fashion is important .
in the initial times of the Pl@@ au@@ ener top , fashion played a major role , was then displ@@ aced by the Heim@@ tex@@ as - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : tip in jewelry , with accessories such as bags and with regional tra@@ ys .
at all Bil@@ o the so @-@ called vintage mode , which is addressed to past styl@@ istic periods , an increasing customer potential .
those who are not serving in the textile industry in Germany is no longer available on the market .
we already make half of all orders with us .
Mo@@ els@@ ons Pl@@ auen is together with nine further companies member of the industry association Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze and Sti@@ cker@@ eien .
only they may carry the protected Label .
over the last 15 years , around 80 percent of the revenues have been broken .
private dealers and also the wholesale ship there are almost no more .
our products hardly reach the customer in this line any more .
the bulk goods today are produced much cheaper in the Asian region and almost exclusively distributed over chains .
in addition , the export of export , current to Russia and the USA .
sufficient reasons for new ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association tries also to score points of environmental awareness , as Cord@@ ula Bauer was explained by the nitrogen pearl in Fal@@ ken@@ stein : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since this year we lead a seal of quality that shows that we are producing ec@@ ologically and socially compatible &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this is also related to the used materials . &quot;
diploma @-@ design@@ ate U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Snow at the West@@ s@@ ächs@@ ische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and is specialised on embro@@ ider@@ ies and tips .
in order to counter@@ pose the competition from the Asian region , one has to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
there is a clash between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and companies which must particularly think economically , &quot; says Schmidt .
therefore an existing design often only varies slightly to hold a customer base .
a few years ago textile designs Kat@@ i Re@@ uter the historic sn@@ ails tip .
the machine cuts small ch@@ icks in some places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Pl@@ au@@ ener Gold lubric@@ ant in Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ d was inspired by it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before , I was able to do nothing with traditional skir@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she uses the sn@@ ails for her jewelry .
in an elaborate process they form the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people in the region identify with the topic of Pl@@ au@@ ener top - young and old , &quot; says Re@@ uter .
they also supplies to the USA , to Australia and after Finland - above all to customers whose ancestors have lived in pl@@ ust and surroundings and want to have a mem@@ ento .
I see my jewelry as a modern Ambassador of Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze ® .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; - Film
legends do not want to mention , but Disney will nevertheless concentrate on a new film of his classic . &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot;
it is going according to &quot; Entertainment Weekly , &quot; but it is a kind of continuation , which 20 years after the first film plays with the magical n@@ anny .
it is about the experience of the N@@ anny with the Banks Peninsula in times of the world economic crisis in England .
who plays P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
but the director stands already firmly : ro@@ b Marshall , last with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; at the cinema .
XI is looking forward to open the economy broader for the world
the economy needs to be wider , to the outside to promote growth , President Xi J@@ in@@ ping said on Tuesday of a group that was commissioned with the steering of the reform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should aim to attract foreign investments and know @-@ how and improve the strategies for business ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an address at the 16th session of the Central Executive Group for a deepening of a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new @-@ ups to promote and strengthen reforms will bring new momentum and vitality through and offer new place for economic growth , said Xi .
the executive group adopted a series of guidelines , including a negative list , regulating the market access , relaxation of the border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ hau@@ l of the citizen &apos;s immune system .
after the statement , a negative list is created , the sectors and companies identified that investments do not come into question .
the system is gradually tested and improved by test programs .
the initiative is of importance , as it demonstrates the market a major role in the allocation of resources , a legally state business environment guaranteed and open the market more open , said the statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government is also keen to lo@@ osen the powers transferred to the companies and make sure that companies decide how they conduct their business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement also stated that China will allow China border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border business cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
in the framework of an offer , state @-@ controlled sectors to open , further areas are open for private investments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will manage the legitimate interests of foreign funded companies and provide better services to them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , it is easier for foreigners , a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; request that the requirements are optimized and the application process will be facilitated .
the right of lawyers to guarantee , to exercise their activity , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .
at the meeting , Premier Li Ke@@ qi@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli , as in one after the meeting had been reported .
EU wants to double the mer@@ cury column in wild fishing
the European Commission is keen to double the limit values for mer@@ cury in big pre@@ dat@@ ors and to the consumers to improve significantly higher dose of the nervous system .
the consumer organization F@@ ood@@ watch , who is an appropriate working paper of the EU , critici@@ zed the plans sharp@@ ly : &quot; risks and side effects mis@@ inf@@ alli@@ zed industrial - and environmental policy are passed with full force against pregnant and inf@@ ants , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limits of the nervous system for large fish at the end of the food chain such as Haiti &apos;s or s@@ word@@ fish from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economic reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are raised by one on two milli@@ grams of Mercury per kilo@@ gram , &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
large pre@@ dat@@ ors are so strongly imp@@ lied with mer@@ cury , so that the limits of which still existing limits are not sold about 50 per cent of the cat@@ ches .
after dou@@ bling of the limits , then only 14.@@ 5 percent would be in@@ conceivable .
in return for this Lo@@ ck@@ ering , the EU wants to tigh@@ test the limits on other fish from currently 0,5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mer@@ cury per kilo@@ gram .
F@@ ood@@ watch was viewed as &quot; trick &quot; because smaller Fried@@ @-@ fish , as about car@@ p usually are so low charged that they already respect the planned maximum levels already today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ab@@ lement at Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an per@@ fi@@ de distr@@ action that helps alone the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mercury is one of the people of high @-@ toxic metal @-@ metal , which is attached to the food chain , above all in car@@ ni@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government war@@ ns us that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already small amounts are particularly cause in the un@@ born damage of the nervous system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs is explained on its homepage with regard to current maximum levels , but that an &quot; health haz@@ ard to the general population &quot; is not expected .
Mercury can primarily go through coal @-@ bon@@ y into the environment .
the German coal @-@ fired power plants come across the German Federal Ministry of Commerce to the Green Bundestag J@@ alena ba@@ de@@ bu@@ ck in excess of six tons of mer@@ cury in the year , two thirds of the total quantity in Germany em@@ itted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mer@@ cury in fish approximately in the Elbe , Rhine and Danube were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; persistent and ground @-@ covered &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mirror &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted in March of the paper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year Europe @-@ wide warnings of mer@@ cury in fish were already among the most common health risks associated with the EU @-@ War@@ n@@ system RA@@ S@@ FF .
F@@ ood@@ watch is calling for consumers to protest against the plans of the EU at : www.@@ tor@@ o@@ sil@@ ber &apos;s editorial board .
