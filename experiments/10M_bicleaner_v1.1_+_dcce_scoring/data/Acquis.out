B ) shall die - or th@@ ori@@ um@@ hal@@ ved material which has not reached under letter c ) , which has not reached the states in the states , thus divide the community of organisation the quantity and composition of the material , provided it is not implemented for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) leaves nuclear material that is manufactured by composition and purity for fuel consumption or is@@ ot@@ ope due to the plant , or the process of process , in which it is produced , or will be introduced in a later stage of the kernel &apos;s circular base material in the States , so it is subject to the others listed in this Agreement .
a ) The backup measures envis@@ aged in this Agreement are subject to nuclear material under the conditions specified in Article 11 , however , the Community is subject to dis@@ claim@@ ing of nuclear material , the backup measures after this Convention is not possible or desirable , so consult the organization and the community of each other about the use of appropriate security measures .
B ) The backup measures envis@@ aged in this Convention are concluded for nuclear material under the conditions specified in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the community is in@@ convenience that this nuclear material is practically non @-@ winning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the request of the community , the organisation free from the organization from the backup measures following this Convention : &quot; &quot; &quot;
a ) special sp@@ atial material if it is used in grams - or smaller amounts as sensor in instruments ;

C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with a is@@ ot@@ or concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 238 that is over 80 % .
at the request of the community fre@@ es the organization nuclear material that would otherwise be subject to backup measures following this Convention , provided the whole , due to this article in the states are set up nuclear material amount at no time than
a ) altogether a kil@@ ogra@@ m special material which can consist of one or more of the following materials :
II ) Ur@@ an with a enrich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lic@@ ation of his weight with the enrich@@ ment ,
III ) Ur@@ an with a enrich@@ ment which is under 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the deri@@ ving of nature , calculated by multip@@ lic@@ ation of his weight with the fifth square of the enrich@@ ment ;
B ) a total of ten met@@ ric tons of nature uran and de@@ ed urine with an enrich@@ ment of more than 0.@@ 00@@ 5 ( 0,5 % ) ;
C ) twenty met@@ ric tons t@@ oss@@ ed urine with an enrich@@ ment of 0.@@ 00@@ 5 ( 0,5 % ) or below ;
should be sub@@ placed core material along with nuclear material which is subject to the backup measures after this Convention is subject to , processed or stored , so the precau@@ tions for the re @-@ application of the backup measures will be made to the material .

the BI@@ S could include stand@@ by @-@ credit agreements with central banks of the cred@@ itor countries , when banks make a corresponding request .
the agreement could be closed up to the total amount of the cred@@ itation to the mechanism , while within a total limits of € 2,@@ 725 billion . this corresponds to 50 % of all future consumption funds of member countries .
even now , though , there are some terms mentioned below , to whose application the BI@@ Z would be ready .
at any stand@@ by @-@ credit the BI@@ Z would initially assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of renew@@ als stocks , without a total of five years .
when opening the loans , as well as with its possible extension , the BI@@ Z would charge a credit balance .

the label on the container contains all entries registered on the corresponding pattern ( Annex 4 ) .
the normal human immun@@ og@@ lo@@ bul@@ in is a emb@@ oss@@ ing of plasma cutting edge , which was produced from human , the anti@@ body of normal adult .
the fabric@@ ation method must ensure that the end product also exceed the conditions described below and does not exceed I@@ no@@ kul@@ ational hep@@ atitis .
moreover , the manufacturing method must ensure that the antibodies contained in the end product are concentrated in the end product in sufficient amount .
the method is satisfac@@ tory for any end @-@ to @-@ end in this respect , if in the initial and final product antibodies required for at least a virus and a bacter@@ ial tox@@ in .
while manufacturing must not be al@@ anti@@ sep@@ tic or bacter@@ ial substance ; in order to ensure bacter@@ ial steri@@ li@@ zation and stability of the end product , you can get an appropriate preser@@ vatives and an appropriate stabil@@ isation .
the end product is delivered as a solution , whose immun@@ og@@ lo@@ bul@@ b must be between 100 and 170 g per liter .
