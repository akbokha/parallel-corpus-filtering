it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , than 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg mel@@ ting ( tablets that can arise in the mouth ) as solution to the inser@@ tion ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. Tur@@ res thinking and speaking , hall@@ uc@@ inations ( hearing or sight of things that are not available ) , distr@@ ust and ins@@ cription ; • bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a psych@@ ic disorder , in which patients have man@@ ic episodes ( periods ) altern@@ ately with periods of normal mood .
A@@ bili@@ fy is used for the treatment of severe to severe man@@ ic episodes and for the prevention of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have addressed the drug in the past .
inj@@ ecting solution is applied to the rapid control of increased un@@ rest or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , if the oral intake of the medication is not possible .
both diseases can take the solution for taking or put the mel@@ ting tabl@@ et@@ ches in patients where the s@@ wal@@ lowing of tablets are prepared .
in patients who are taking other medicines at the same time as A@@ bili@@ fy , the dose of A@@ bili@@ fy should be customized .
this affects the signal transmission between brain cells by means of neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters , i.e. chemical substances that allow communication between nerve cells to each other .
Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ zol pres@@ um@@ ably works mainly as a partial ag@@ on@@ ist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters d@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in called ) .
this means Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ zol like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and d@@ op@@ amine , but in a low degree as the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters works to enable the recept@@ ors .
da D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin near schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar disorder has a role played , Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ zol to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , causing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and to prevent their re@@ acting .
the effectiveness of an@@ bili@@ fy that re@@ occur in the symptoms of symptoms , was examined in three studies over up to one year .
the effectiveness of inj@@ ecting solution was compared in two studies in 8@@ 05 patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia or similar diseases , which compared to increased un@@ rest , over a period of two hours with a plac@@ ebo .
in a further study , A@@ bili@@ fy about twelve weeks in 3@@ 47 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l , in another study the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy and plac@@ ebo that re@@ occur to 160 patients with which the man@@ ic symptoms were already stabili@@ zed with A@@ bili@@ fy .
the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy inj@@ ecting solution has been in a study on 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , who suffered in st@@ agn@@ ant un@@ rest , with which by Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( an other anti@@ psych@@ otic ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies the change in symptoms of patients were examined using a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients infected with the treatment , examined .
the company also led studies to examine how the body gets the mel@@ ting @-@ coated tablets and the solution for taking ( up ) .
in both studies with inj@@ ecting solution showed patients who received A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5,@@ 25 mg , 9,75 mg or 15 mg , a significant increased reduction in symptoms increased stress than the patients who received a plac@@ ebo .
in the application for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder reduced A@@ bili@@ fy in four of the five short @-@ term studies more effective than plac@@ ebo .
A@@ bili@@ fy also used up to 74 weeks in more effective than plac@@ ebo and re@@ plac@@ ental episodes in previously treated patients and when it comes in addition to an existing treatment .
an@@ bili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg @-@ doses reduced more effective than plac@@ ebo the symptoms increased un@@ disturbed and were similar effectively as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy for taking ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extr@@ ap@@ yr@@ amid@@ al disorders ( continuous ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( infl@@ ection ) , voc@@ als , nau@@ sea ( elevated memory ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ less@@ ness , ins@@ om@@ never ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety .
the Committee on Human@@ phar@@ yn@@ x ( CH@@ MP ) finished to the conclusion that the advantages of A@@ bili@@ fy for treating schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients , the predomin@@ antly man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes of the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ zol spoke to ou@@ tw@@ ei@@ gh the risks .
in addition , the committee came to the outcome that the benefits of inj@@ ecting solution for rapid control of increased un@@ rest and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , if a oral therapy is not suitable to ou@@ tw@@ ei@@ gh the risks .
June 2004 , the European Commission shared the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . a permit for the transportation of i@@ bili@@ fy in the whole European Union .
ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y is a disorder in the treatment of excessive to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I@@ - disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients indicated , the predomin@@ antly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ isi ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y amounts 10 or 15 mg / day at a refresh@@ ment dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
a st@@ acked effectiveness in dos@@ ages above a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y amounts to 15 mg once daily , ir@@ respective of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the effectiveness of ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar @-@ I@@ - disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group should be considered a lower Initi@@ al dosage , if clinical factors do this justi@@ fy ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ duc@@ tor is set out of the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ zol dose to be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) .
the appearance of succ@@ essive behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders , and has been reported in some cases after the start or change of an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ zol ( see Section 4.8 ) .
results of a epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder is no increased ad@@ missions risk with Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ zol compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ka .
Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ zol should be used with caution in patients with known cardi@@ ovascular diseases , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cul@@ osis , hypo@@ thesis , hypo@@ vol@@ ous drugs , hypo@@ vol@@ ous medicines ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ak@@ zel@@ eri@@ ous and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) .

if at one with ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y patients treated signs and symptoms of a Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esie patients should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment .
if a patient has developed signs and symptoms which imp@@ ose on a m@@ ns , or un@@ clean high fe@@ ver without any additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ka must be ab@@ duc@@ ted , including ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y .
therefore Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ zol should be used in patients with cl@@ amping cases in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese or at random , which are being used with cr@@ amp@@ ons .

there were however in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between dosage and the speaking for unwanted cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cul@@ ary events upon with Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ zol patients .
hyper@@ met@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with K@@ eto@@ azi@@ erg@@ osis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em Com@@ a or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y .
there is no precise risk assessment for Hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia @-@ related unwanted events with ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents to be treated with direct transmis@@ sions .

if one should consider the common gift from K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol or other high @-@ effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors with ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y , the potential benefits should predomin@@ ate potential risks for the patient .
other highly @-@ effective in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , like I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ol and HIV prot@@ ocols , are likely to have similar effects and therefore should be made similar c@@ umul@@ ative issues .
after dism@@ iss@@ ing the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors the dosage of ABI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y should be raised to the dosage height before the beginning of the companion therapy .

the patient should be coming to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ bil@@ zol .
due to the in@@ sufficient data situation for the safety of people and due to the re@@ production studies for animal studies , this medicine may not be applied in pregnancy , unless the potential benefits justi@@ fies clearly the potential risk for the fet@@ us .

the effectiveness of abra@@ x@@ ane has been studied in a main study , attended by 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which approximately three quarters of earlier a anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ in had received .
the effect of abra@@ x@@ ane ( in all@@ some hu@@ bs or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared to the pharmaceutical chem@@ otherapy ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
overall , in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) the 229 with Abra@@ si@@ ane @-@ treated patients to the treatment of , across 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients included in conventional p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
only the patients were treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer , in terms of eff@@ ic@@ acy dict@@ ators such as time until the deteri@@ oration of the disease and survival there was no difference between medicines .
on the other hand , with patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer , in relation to these indicators that abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el contained .
it may also not be used in patients who are bre@@ ast@@ feed or before the treatment low blood @-@ phil@@ ately in the blood .
the Committee on Human@@ phar@@ yn@@ x ( CH@@ MP ) made that the first treatment was no longer propos@@ ing to be more effective than conventional p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medicines and that it must not be given in contrast to other p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drugs to reduce side effects .
January 2008 , the European Commission for the company Ref@@ xis Bios@@ ci@@ ence Limited has an approval for the acqu@@ iring from abra@@ x@@ ane in the whole of the European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ mon@@ otherapy is inde@@ xed for the treatment of metastatic Mam@@ mak@@ in@@ zin@@ om in patients , in which the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease is not shown and for which a standard anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ in @-@ contained therapy is not shown ( see also section 4.4 ) .
in case of patients with severe neutral number &lt; 0.50 x 109 / l about a period of one week or longer ) or severe sens@@ ory N@@ europ@@ ath@@ ic during the abra@@ x@@ ane therapy the dose should be reduced in the following series on 220 mg / m2 .
in sens@@ ory N@@ europ@@ ath@@ ic Grad 3 is to break the treatment until a recovery at level 1 or 2 reaches , and with all subsequent cycles , the dose needs to be reduced .
there is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dosage adjustment in patients with mild to moderate imp@@ air@@ ment of the liver function ( see Section 4.@@ 4 and 5.2 ) .
there have been no studies conducted with patients with com@@ promised kid@@ ney function and there is currently no adequate data on the recommendation of dosage adjustment in patients with imp@@ air@@ ment of kid@@ ney function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to non @-@ sufficient data for in@@ concei@@ vable and effectiveness .

if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should immediately decrease and have been initiated a sympt@@ omatic treatment , and the patient must not be treated again with Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in patients there should be no further preser@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles , up to the neut@@ ron @-@ phil@@ ately returned to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ al number increased back to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver functioning ( B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with abra@@ x@@ ane .
while a clearly marked with abra@@ x@@ ane in connection has not been proven , cardi@@ ovascular diseases are un@@ common , especially in patients with earlier anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ ine treatment or underlying con@@ domini@@ um or cor@@ rupt cardi@@ ac disease .

male patients who are treated with Abra@@ si@@ ane , will be advised , during and up to six months after treatment no child to be witnesses .
male patients should be advised in treating the treatment through a sperm archiving , because with the therapy with abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ si@@ ane can cause unwanted side effects as fatigue ( very frequent ) and sw@@ ing@@ arm ( frequent ) , which can affect the traffic and ability to operate machinery .
in the following are the most common and most important inci@@ dents of side @-@ effects associated with 229 patients with metastatic Mam@@ mak@@ ar@@ cin@@ oma who were treated in the pi@@ vot@@ al clinical phase III study once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2
neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ y was the striking important h@@ ä@@ mat@@ ological tox@@ icity ( in 79 % of the patients reported ) and was quickly reversible and dos@@ is@@ dependent ; Leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ie was reported at 71 % of the patients .
an@@ emia ( HB &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed at 46 % of the patients treated with abra@@ x@@ ane and had been severe in three cases ( HB &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
in table 1 the side effects shown that occurred in conjunction with the gift of Abra@@ si@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy with any dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .

this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed a biological medicine is similar to which is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and is equivalent to the same drug as well ( &quot; reference therapeutic . &quot; ) .
it is used in patients with normal ble@@ eding data in case where intervention can occur in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion complications in case the intervention is not possible to expect a blood loss from 900 to 1 800 ml .
treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is shown .
in patients with kid@@ ney problems and in patients who want to make a self @-@ blood circulation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ene .
the injection can also be carried out from the patient or a super@@ visor where appropriate guidance can be obtained .
in patients with chronic kid@@ ney failure or in patients who receive chem@@ otherapy , the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ values should always be in the recommended area ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ form@@ ers in adults respectively between 9.5 and 11 g / dl of children ) .
the Iron of all patients are before treatment to ensure that no iron gel is made , and iron supplements should be administ@@ ered during the entire treatment .
in patients who receive a chem@@ otherapy , or in patients with kid@@ ney problems , an an@@ emia can be caused by a ery@@ thro@@ po@@ graphic organ or by the fact that the body speaks not sufficient to the body &apos;s body thro@@ po@@ ids .
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also applied to operations to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of blood pressure .
it is produced by a cell that has been produced by a gene ( DNA ) that it proved to become the formation of ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared with administration as an injection in a v@@ ene in the context of a main stu@@ b@@ ulation with 479 patients who suffered in one by kid@@ ney problems caused by reference .
all patients participating in this study was at least eight weeks of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o had been inj@@ ected into a v@@ ene before they were either de@@ amed to de@@ amed or continued to E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
major indicators for the eff@@ ic@@ acy was the change of her@@ etic values between the beginning of the study and the survey period in weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also placed the results of a study in which the effects of under the skin su@@ pr@@ it@@ ated Ab@@ se@@ amed were investigated with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o at 114 canc@@ ers who received a chem@@ otherapy .
in the study with patients who suffered in one by kid@@ ney problems , the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ess were caused by patients who were imprison@@ ed at Ab@@ se@@ amed as in the same measure as with those who received E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
compared to that , patients showed E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o received an increase of 0.@@ 0@@ 63 g / dl of the output value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which occasionally lead to symptoms of an encephal@@ opathy ( encephal@@ opathy ) such as su@@ dden , st@@ ing@@ ed head@@ aches and confusion .
Ab@@ se@@ amed may not be used in patients who may possibly pers@@ ensi@@ tive ( allergic ) against ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients .
Ab@@ se@@ amed as inj@@ ecting under the skin is not recommended for treating kid@@ ney problems , as further studies are required to ensure that this has been triggered by any allergic reactions .
the Committee on Human@@ phar@@ yn@@ x ( CH@@ MP ) was finished to conclude that for Ab@@ se@@ amed , in accordance with the provisions of the European Union of evidence was provided that the medicines has a comparable quality , safety and eff@@ ic@@ acy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .

if the HB @-@ increase is bigger than 2 g / dl ( 8.@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a HB @-@ value of 13 g / dl ( 8.@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose needs to be adapted according to Section 4.2 ( see Section 4.2 treatment of patients with chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ist an@@ emia - dosage adjustment between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl to keep ) .
the decision for applying re@@ combin@@ ant Er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on the use of the respective patients taking into account the specific clinical context .
in patients who are envis@@ aged for a larger electricity orthop@@ edi@@ c procedure , should , if possible , before the beginning of the ep@@ ox@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy the cause of an@@ emia are examined and treated accordingly .
patients who receive a greater electri@@ fied orthop@@ edi@@ c procedure should have an appropriate Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ os@@ e@@ proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis , as they have a increased risk for thro@@ mb@@ otic and v@@ ascular diseases , especially in a underlying cardi@@ ovascular disease .
in addition , it cannot be excluded that in case of treatment with ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa , for patients with a starting tro@@ phy value of &gt; 13 g / dl of an increased risk for post@@ operative cardi@@ otic / v@@ ascular events can exist .
in several controlled studies , ep@@ et@@ ine has not been proven that they can survive in tum@@ our patients with sympt@@ omatic an@@ emia , or dimin@@ ish the risk of tum@@ our pro@@ gression .

A@@ cl@@ asta is applied to treat the following diseases : • oste@@ opor@@ osis ( an ail@@ ment which makes the bones jump ) both in women after men@@ op@@ ause and in men .
it is applied in patients with a high freight risk ( bone break ) , including in patients who have recently suffered a sli@@ gh@@ tening gir@@ d@@ le ; • Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et must take at least 500 mg calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip re@@ frac@@ ture should have a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) or@@ ally or through inj@@ ecting into a muscle .

during the first study , nearly 8 000 older women were involved in oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of sp@@ inal sens@@ ations and hip contrac@@ tions have been studied over a period of three years .
the second study covered by 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis of 50 years , which had recently suffered a gir@@ d@@ ash , and the number of frac@@ tures were examined over a period of up to five years .
at Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et , A@@ cl@@ asta has been tested in two studies with a total of 357 patients and compared six months with our Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( a different bis@@ phosph@@ ate ) .
main inde@@ xed for the eff@@ ic@@ acy was whether the content of al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ ate bases in the ser@@ um ( a enz@@ y@@ me , the bone sub@@ str@@ apping ) will restore in the blood once more norm@@ alized or by at least 75 % compared to the starting signal .
in the study with older women the risk of sp@@ ine frac@@ tures for patients were reduced under A@@ cl@@ asta ( without any other oste@@ opor@@ os@@ em@@ edi@@ c ) over a period of three years compared to the patients on plac@@ ebo by 70 % .
compared with all patients under A@@ cl@@ asta ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) with those on plac@@ ebo the risk of Hip frac@@ tures decreased by 41 % reduced .
in the study involving men and women with hip re@@ frac@@ ture had 9 % of the patients under A@@ cl@@ asta a Fra@@ ktur ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of the patients under plac@@ ebo ( 139 from 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most of the side effects of A@@ cl@@ asta appear within the first three days after inf@@ usion and are less common in repeated inf@@ usions .
A@@ cl@@ asta may not be used in patients who may possibly pers@@ ensi@@ tive ( allergic ) against Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic or other Bis@@ phosph@@ onate or any of other ingredients .
as with all Bis@@ phosph@@ ates , patients are subject to A@@ cl@@ asta to the risk of kid@@ ney , responses at the inf@@ usion and oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose ( Ab@@ die from bone tissues ) in the j@@ aw .

11 The effectiveness of an inf@@ usion of 5 mg of f@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid compared to the intake of 30 mg Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at once daily during 2 months has been proven in two six months studies .
the combined results were observed after 6 months a similar decrease of pain , and pain @-@ controlled compared to the output value for A@@ cl@@ asta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients who were classified as Respon@@ si@@ re at the end of the Six ( on the therapy ) could be recorded in a follow @-@ up phase .

the statement of the EP@@ AR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public License Report ( EP@@ AR ) , in which he explained how the Committee for Human@@ phar@@ yn@@ x ( CH@@ MP ) has been judged to provide recommendations concerning the application of the drug .
Ac@@ tos is applied to the treatment of type @-@ 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ ins@@ ulin @-@ dependent Diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) in which met@@ form@@ in ( a di@@ abet@@ es@@ medi@@ k@@ ament ) is not shown . • It can be used together with another di@@ abet@@ es@@ medi@@ k@@ ament ( Dual@@ Therap@@ y ) .
it can additionally be applied to met@@ form@@ in for patients ( especially overweight patients ) that can not be satisfac@@ tory with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose .
in combination with a Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff or ins@@ ulin the previous dose of Sul@@ f@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ rogen or ins@@ ulin can be maintained at the beginning of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except for patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here should be reduced the dose of Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ rogen or in@@ ulate .
this means that the body of your own ins@@ ulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decre@@ ases , which makes the type 2 diabetes better set .
with more than 1 400 patients the effectiveness of Ac@@ tos in tri@@ ple@@ therapy has been studied ; in addition , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff , in addition they received up to 3.5 years of either Ac@@ tos or plac@@ ebo .
in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ zed Hä@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) measured that indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tos led to lower@@ ing the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which suggests that the blood sugar levels in application of doses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg have been reduced .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study the effect of the extra gift of Ac@@ tos to existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ant demonstrated in a lower@@ ing of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values around 0,94 % , while the additional gift of plac@@ ebo to a lower@@ ing of 0,35 % resulted .
in a small study , in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and ins@@ ulin used for 289 patients were examined , the patients , the Ac@@ tos in addition to ins@@ ulin tests , a reduction of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of exactly 6 % after 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in the patient which took additional plac@@ ebo .
the most common side effects related to Ac@@ tos were visual disorders , infections of the upper breathing paths ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ esth@@ esia ( decreased sensitivity to maturity ) .
Ac@@ tos must neither be used for patients who may possibly take hy@@ pers@@ ensi@@ tive ( allergic ) towards Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or one of the other ingredients , nor in patients with liver issues , heart failure or di@@ abe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ er ( high st@@ resses - inf@@ aci@@ dity - in the blood ) .
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos in the context of mon@@ otherapy ( during the universal treatment ) as an alternative to the default treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients should be shown in which met@@ form@@ in is not shown .
October 2000 , the European Commission shared by the company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited a permit for the transfer of accounts in the whole of the European Union .
the tablets are white to white , round , curved , and wear on one side the mark@@ ings &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other hand the title &quot; AC@@ TOS . &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is also indicated for combination with ins@@ ulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar has been in@@ adequate , and where met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance is un@@ suitable ( see Section 4.4 ) .
for use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under 18 years of age , no data is available , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients who are endangered by the presence at least a risk factor ( e.g. former coron@@ ary heart disease or sympt@@ omatic coron@@ ary heart illness ) , the doctor should begin the treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of a heart failure , weight gain or o@@ de@@ me , especially those with reduced cardi@@ ac reserve .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of a heart failure , weight gain and o@@ de@@ me to be observed if pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ is is used in combination with ins@@ ulin .
a cardi@@ ovascular study involving Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mak@@ rov@@ as@@ cul@@ ary disorder has been performed .
in this study , an increase in reports on in@@ zin@@ ess results showed , however , which did not lead to an increase in Mort@@ ality in the study .
in patients with increased output @-@ life @-@ enzym@@ atic ( AL@@ T &gt; 2,5 x upper limit of the standard area ) or with other signs of a liver disease may not be used Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .
if the AL@@ T mirror up to the 3 @-@ lateral of the upper limit of the average range are increased , the liver enzym@@ es are as soon as possible to control .
if a patient is evol@@ ving to refer to a hep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting , fatigue , fatigue , appeti@@ te and / or dar@@ ker Har@@ n , are the liver enzym@@ es to review .
the decision whether the treatment of patients with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ is continues , should be guided by the laboratory parameters from clinical value .
in clinical studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one has been established a dos@@ is@@ dependent weight , which can be raised by obesity and connected in some cases with a hydr@@ ation .
as a result of a hem@@ at@@ tion , under therapy with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , a slight reduction of the middle heads of her@@ b ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and the ha@@ emat@@ ocr@@ ine ( relative reduction by 4.@@ 1 % ) .
similar changes have been observed in compar@@ ing controlled clinical studies involving Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients with met@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 3 @-@ 4 % and the hem@@ at@@ ch@@ its by 3.6 @-@ 4,@@ 1 % ) and ins@@ ulin ( relative reduction of the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ s by 1 @-@ 2 % and the tick @-@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of increased ins@@ ulin @-@ sensitivity , in patients who receive Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on as oral or triple combination therapy with a Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ant or as a two @-@ specialist combination therapy with ins@@ ulin , the risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
following the market introduction was reported among the treatment with thi@@ az@@ oli@@ ons , including Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , about a occurrence or a deteri@@ oration of a di@@ abe@@ tic mac@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ s with a reduction of visual ac@@ u@@ ity .
it is un@@ clear whether there are a direct connection between the intake of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and the appearance of Mak@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ de@@ men , though patients should be aware of a Mak@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ dem@@ s when patients report about disorders of visual ac@@ u@@ ity ; a suitable oph@@ thalm@@ ologic statement should be considered .
in a summary analysis of messages undes@@ irable events in random@@ ized , controlled , double @-@ blin@@ ded clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on
the accounting @-@ structure incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years in the with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated with women and 1,1 freight @-@ years with women who were treated with a compar@@ isons .
in the pro@@ active study , a study of 3.5 years of investigation of cardi@@ ovascular events , frac@@ tures performed at 44 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years ) in patients with patients treated with a compar@@ isons .
patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy and if a patient wants an pregnancy or this entry , the treatment is exp@@ ose ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies on investigations of interactions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ is does not have relevant effects on the pharmac@@ ogen@@ ic or pharmac@@ od@@ ynam@@ ics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , War@@ r@@ ine , Phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in ex@@ erts .
interactions with pharmac@@ euticals , which are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by these enzym@@ es , e.g. or@@ ale contrac@@ ep@@ tive , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium @-@ channel and H@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduction .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with Gem@@ fi@@ bro@@ zil ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) results in an increase in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on around the 3 @-@ fold .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C8 @-@ Indu@@ ktor ) resulted in lower@@ ing the AU@@ C from Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
this is attri@@ but@@ able that under treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one that decre@@ ases in pregnancy and increased ins@@ ulin resistance of the wom@@ ens and thus reducing the availability of the met@@ abo@@ lic sub@@ str@@ ates for the bra@@ zing growth .

these lead to a temporary change in the tur@@ mo@@ ors and the re@@ inde@@ xed index of the lens , as they are also observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic agents .
in clinical studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T reports on the three @-@ fold the upper limit of the standard range also frequently appears on how to plac@@ ebo but sel@@ dom than in compar@@ ative groups under met@@ form@@ in or Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff .
in an Out@@ come study in patients with leading advanced mak@@ rov@@ as@@ cular illness was the frequency of severe herbal failure in Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on around 1.6 percent higher than plac@@ ebo if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on b@@ z@@ w .
since the introduction of the market has been reported on pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , however , more frequently , if pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ is used in combination with ins@@ ulin or in patients with heart failure in An@@ am@@ n@@ ese .
it has been a summary analysis of messages undes@@ irable events in random@@ ized , controlled , double @-@ blin@@ ded clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated groups and over 7,@@ 400 patients in the groups treated with compar@@ isons .
in the over a period of 3.5 years of ongoing pro@@ active study , frac@@ tures performed at 44 / 870 ( 5.@@ 1 % ) of the patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients with a compar@@ isons .
when taking the pres@@ ump@@ ed maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days occurred no symptoms .
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one seems to act by activ@@ ating specific core recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator , Rec@@ ept@@ or @-@ g ( PP@@ AR @-@ g ) ) , which leads in the animal @-@ model to an increased in@@ ulate of liver , li@@ pid and sk@@ elet@@ al cells .
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduces Glu@@ cos@@ e@@ produktion in the liver and the peri@@ ph@@ eral gl@@ uc@@ tion@@ stand@@ ings in the case of an ins@@ ulin resistant .
a clinical study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on versus Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d as mon@@ otherapy was conducted over two years to examine the time until after the therapeutic effects ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8,@@ 0 % after the first 6 treatments ) .
at the time after two years after the start of therapy it was able to maintain blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8,@@ 0 % ) by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on at 69 % of the patients to be treated ( compared to 50 % of the patients below Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de ) .
in a plac@@ ebo study over 12 months , patients , whose blood sugar has been in@@ adequate despite three im@@ on@@ ati@@ ger optimization phase with ins@@ ulin , to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or plac@@ ebo .
in patients suffering from Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced the middle H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c - value by 0,45 % , compared to the patients , which remain only ins@@ ulin ; a reduction of in@@ sul@@ ot@@ ation in the group treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated .
in clinical studies over a year showed a statisti@@ cally significant de@@ position of the Alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ in comparison with the output values .
the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus plac@@ ebo ) was tested in a small , based on two weeks tested by type 2 di@@ abe@@ tics .
in most clinical trials compared to plac@@ ebo a reduction in the total plasma cutting systems and the free fatty acids and an increase in the HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels as well as low , however clin@@ ically not significant higher LD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels observed .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years reduced pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one compared to plac@@ ebo , met@@ form@@ in or gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de the total plas@@ mat@@ ri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L Chol@@ ester@@ levels .
compared to plac@@ ebo was detected no statisti@@ cally significant increase in LD@@ L Chol@@ ester@@ levels , while met@@ form@@ in and gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de waste values were observed .
in a study about 20 weeks of reduced pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on not only the so@@ ber @-@ or@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de , but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial dis @-@ level mirror , this is both an effect on the Tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ d absorption and the hep@@ atic Tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis .
in the pro@@ active study , a cardi@@ ovascular study , 5@@ 238 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mak@@ rov@@ as@@ cul@@ ans in groups were random@@ ised that were additionally applied over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing anti@@ di@@ abe@@ tic and cardi@@ ovascular and plac@@ ebo .
according to or@@ aler application , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ is quickly res@@ or@@ ated , with the peak concentration of un@@ modified Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in plasma usually reaches 2 hours after application .
based on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV applies to the eff@@ ic@@ acy of the effectiveness of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , whereas the relative humidity of M @-@ II is minimal .
in Inter@@ action studies , it could be proven that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ is has no relevant effect on the pharmac@@ ogen@@ ic or pharmac@@ od@@ ynam@@ ics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , War@@ r@@ ine , Phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with Gem@@ fi@@ bro@@ zil ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C8 @-@ Indu@@ ktor ) and lowers the plasma @-@ centr@@ ation of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( see Section 4.5 ) .
after oral applications of radi@@ o@@ active striking Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in humans the mark@@ er was found mainly in the f@@ ences ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the har@@ n ( 45 % ) .
the average plasma @-@ elimination of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on amounts to humans 5 @-@ 6 hours , and that of the whole active met@@ abo@@ lic is at 16 - 23 hours .
the plasma @-@ concentration of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and its met@@ abo@@ lic disorders are lower in patients with reduced kid@@ ney function lower than in healthy volunteers , but also resem@@ ble the rar@@ ity of the or@@ alen Clear@@ ance of the mat@@ ernity .

Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane has been produced in total 294 people with type @-@ 1 diabetes , in which the pan@@ cre@@ as can not produce ins@@ ulin , and type 2 diabetes , in which the body is not able to explo@@ it ins@@ ulin effective .
in the study after 12 weeks concentration of substance ( gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ zed Hä@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) measured that indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane led to an acceptance of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c sp@@ y that bre@@ eds the blood sugar level similar to another human ins@@ ulin .
Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may possibly take hy@@ pers@@ ensi@@ tive ( allergic ) to Human@@ ins@@ ulin ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane may need to be customized if it is administ@@ ered along with a number of other medicines that can impact on the blood sugar ( the full list is the pack carrier ) .
the Committee on Human@@ phar@@ yn@@ x ( CH@@ MP ) was concluded that the benefits of Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane in the treatment of diabetes are ou@@ tw@@ ei@@ gh the risks .
October 2002 , the European Commission shared the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the transportation of Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane in the whole of the European Union .
advanced In@@ sul@@ in@@ products are usually applied once or twice daily when a quick initi@@ ate effect will be desired along with a longer lasting effect .
the inj@@ ector has to leave at least 6 seconds under the skin to ensure that the entire dose is inj@@ ected .
patients , whose blood sugar has improved significantly improved by means of an intensi@@ fied int@@ sul@@ in@@ therapy , can change the hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia od@@ esi@@ cles and should be advised accordingly .
any amend@@ ment regarding strength , brand ( manufacturers ) , In@@ sul@@ int@@ yp ( quickly acting , bi@@ ph@@ as@@ ic , long acting ins@@ ulin , etc . ) , type of in@@ sist@@ or ( animal ins@@ ulin ) and / or manufacturing method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA towards ins@@ ulin origin ) can lead to that a change in dosage is required .
if the change to acet@@ one in patients may require a dosage adjustment , it may be necessary in the initial dosage or in the first few weeks or months after the switch .
some patients , where hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions appeared after a change of animal species ins@@ ulin , reported that the early warning @-@ sympt@@ om of a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia were less pronoun@@ ced or different from their previous ins@@ ulin .
in particular , travelling over several time zones , the patient should be pointed out to the advice of his am@@ chi , since such trips can lead to that ins@@ ulin and meals must be used or taken at other times .
the doctor must therefore consider possible interactions in the therapy and may always ask for his patients to other drugs used by them .
4 In@@ c@@ low hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia as well as hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia that can occur in one not adequ@@ ately controlled di@@ abet@@ es@@ therapy , increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and fruit del@@ ights in uter@@ o .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ics can lead to un@@ consciousness and / or cl@@ amping cases and with temporary or permanent disorders of the brain function and even death .
disorders of the nervous system occasionally - peri@@ ph@@ ere N@@ europ@@ athy A rapid recovery of blood sugar control can be linked with complaints that are called ac@@ ute pain@@ ful N@@ europ@@ athy and normally are reversible .
5 An intensi@@ fication of the in@@ sist@@ in@@ therapy with a ab@@ rupt enhancement of blood sugar settings may however be connected to a temporary deteri@@ oration of di@@ abe@@ tic re@@ tin@@ opathy .
diseases of the skin and the under@@ body @-@ purpose occasionally - Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy An der injection station can switch a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy if it was failed to switch entry within the injection range .
general diseases and complaints at the appointment occasionally - Local Produc@@ tivity reaction in the inj@@ ecting location Dur@@ ing the In@@ sul@@ in@@ therapy can occur local over@@ sensitivity ( red@@ ness , sw@@ elling , it@@ ching , pain and ha@@ emat@@ om to the inj@@ ecting location ) .

a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can however develop gradually : • Light mort@@ gage can be treated by the oral audience of gl@@ uc@@ ose or sugar @-@ bearing food .
di@@ abe@@ tics therefore should always have sor@@ rows , swe@@ ets , bis@@ cuits or sugar fruit juice with un@@ inhi@@ bited or sub@@ cut@@ aneous inj@@ ecting from gl@@ uc@@ co ( 0,5 to 1,0 mg ) by a controlled support person or by gl@@ uc@@ ose that is given intra@@ ven@@ ously by the doctor .

if the ur@@ inary tract can still be increased after two to four weeks more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ ite , the dose may be increased once a day 120 mg .
during the first treatment of treatment things can still occur , therefore the patients should be taking at least during the first six months in treatment with A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic even further medicines for preventing G@@ ich@@ tan@@ accidents .

in the second study , there were two doses of A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) one year to 7@@ 62 patients each with Al@@ lo@@ vel@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ vel@@ in@@ ol was applied in a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kid@@ ney problems spent only 100 mg per day .
main inde@@ b@@ ator for the eff@@ ic@@ acy was the number of patients whose ur@@ inary tr@@ aps in the blood for the last three measurements under 6 mg / dl lay .
in the first study did 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of patients who took up A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of patients , which were once daily 120 mg in the blood of below 6 mg / dl .
in comparison to this , this was 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of patients suffering from Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and in none of the 134 patients under plac@@ ebo .
the most common side effects of A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , di@@ arr@@ he@@ a , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , rash and ab@@ normal liver values .
especially in patients with cardi@@ ac disease , possibly there is also an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee on Human@@ phar@@ yn@@ x ( CH@@ MP ) ended in the conclusion that A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lower@@ ing the ur@@ inary tract in the blood but also a higher risk of side @-@ effects associated with the heart and blood vessels .

AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE will be used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease , in which the bone bro@@ o@@ grams are used ) with women after men@@ op@@ ause , where a risk consists of a low vitamin D level .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or inser@@ tion other medicines ( including an@@ ta@@ zi@@ da , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid a irrit@@ ation of the eating , the patient must take place after the first food intake of the day , which should be carried at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at and vitamin D@@ 3 are already used separately in medicines that are approved in the European Union , placed the company data from earlier trials and published literature .

• AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE is supposed to be s@@ wal@@ low@@ ed after the day of the day only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • The patients should not take the tablet or tablet in the mouth as a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ ls . • The patients should not take place before the first food intake of the day , at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
B. pep@@ tical Ul@@ kus , active gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal ble@@ eding or surgical procedures in the upper Gastro@@ intest@@ inal tra@@ kt besides P@@ yl@@ or@@ op@@ last@@ y , only under particular caution are given ( see Section 4.3 ) .
Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ age@@ ale reactions , such as Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ agi@@ tis , mal@@ oph@@ age@@ ale Ul@@ timo and ös@@ oph@@ age@@ ale ero@@ om , rare followed by pat@@ oph@@ age@@ ous al@@ tions , were reported in patients under the intake of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( partly these severe problems and required a hospital reference ) .
the doctor should therefore be attentive to all signs and symptoms that are advised on possible mal@@ oph@@ onic irrit@@ ation such as Dy@@ cel@@ ag@@ ie , pain while si@@ pping or retro@@ vir@@ al pain , or a new or a s@@ lim@@ m@@ ern@@ ment of so@@ d@@ burn the medicines and take medical advice ( see Section 4.8 ) .
3 The risk of severe vi@@ ci@@ ous side @-@ side effects seems to be increased in patients who are not taking their medicine properly and / or it is based on the appearance of symptoms which refer to a mal@@ oph@@ onic irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dos@@ ing instructions can be given to the patient and be understood by the patient ( see Section 4.2 ) .
while in large clinical trials by Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at no increased risk has been established , rare ( after market introduction ) gast@@ ric and Du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ ls , including some severe viruses and with complications , reported ( see Section 4.8 ) .
Oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose des Ki@@ ef@@ ers , usually in connection with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ om@@ yel@@ i@@ tis ) , has been reported in cancer patients , whose therap@@ ist predomin@@ ates trag@@ ven@@ ously administ@@ ered bis@@ phosph@@ onate .
there are no data available to give advice , whether the de@@ preci@@ ation of a bis@@ phosph@@ onate treatment in patients who need a ki@@ ate surgical procedure , dimin@@ ished the risk of a col@@ on@@ ec@@ rose by the ki@@ ef@@ ers .
clinical assessment by the doctor @-@ treated doctor is author@@ it@@ ative for the therapy of therapy in each patient based on individual benefits of the risk assessment .
patients should be reli@@ ant that they should take the tablet in the next morning after taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE the tablet next morning after they have noticed their failure .
you should not take two tablets on the same day but taking one tablet every week as originally planned on the week@@ day .
other diseases that affect the minerals metabolism ( such as vitamin D lack and Hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ di@@ m ) , should be treated before starting treatment with AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE also ad@@ or@@ qu@@ ate .
al@@ end@@ ron@@ at foods and drinks ( including mineral supplements ) , calcium supplements , an@@ ta@@ zi@@ da and some oral medicines may affect the Res@@ or@@ ption of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at if they are taken at the same time .
therefore patients must wait after taking up al@@ end@@ ron@@ at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific inter@@ ac@@ tion@@ studies were not carried out , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was taken jointly with a variety of usually prescribed medicines , without the clin@@ ically relevant interactions .
AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE is only intended for use in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not intended to apply during pregnancy or bre@@ ast@@ feeding women .
Ti@@ erst@@ udi@@ en with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at does not allow any indication of directly ash@@ amed effects in terms of pregnancy , the embryo / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .

careful and re@@ peti@@ tive controls between the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Tal@@ spiegel are recommended during the first two weeks after tran@@ splan@@ tation under Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f to ensure proper substance exposure to the immediate after@@ math phase .
since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low Clear@@ ance , can take a adjustment of the Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f @-@ Dos@@ is@@ sch@@ eme several days until the Ste@@ ady State is achieved .
if the condition of the patient is not permitted in the first post@@ operative phase in the first post@@ operative phase , the tac@@ ci@@ ous treatment of intra@@ ven@@ ous ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml of concentr@@ ates to produce an inf@@ usion solution ) are associated with a dose of ca .
the duration of the application of c@@ ur repres@@ sion of the tran@@ splan@@ repres@@ sion must be maintained ; consequently , consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified .
Dos@@ age recommendations - ri@@ cher &apos;s proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of the tran@@ splan@@ ts The oral Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f therapy should start with 0,@@ 20 - 0,30 mg / kg / day as once daily intake in the morning .
further dosage adjustments can be later required since the pharmac@@ ogen@@ ic sti@@ cs from Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can change during the stabil@@ isation of the patient after the tran@@ splan@@ tation .
Dos@@ age recommendations - liver tran@@ sc@@ ary of the tran@@ splan@@ ts The oral Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f therapy should start with 0.10 - 0,@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily intake in the morning .
dos@@ ing Recommen@@ dation - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f must be converted from Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to a once daily intake of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , so this shift in ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) related to the entire day dose .
Ni@@ er@@ - and liver tran@@ splan@@ tation After an switching from other immun@@ os@@ res@@ si@@ va on Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f once daily the treatment must begin with each in kid@@ ney and liver tran@@ splan@@ tation for the proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of the tran@@ splan@@ tion .
statement tran@@ splan@@ tation In adult patients who are converted to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f is a oral starting dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day every day in the morning .
other tran@@ splan@@ ts : although there are no clinical experience with Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f in pul@@ mon@@ ary , pan@@ cre@@ atic and dar@@ m@@ d@@ osis of 0,10 - 0.15 mg / kg / day , at pan@@ cre@@ atic tran@@ dosage of 0,2 mg / kg / day and at gut tran@@ splan@@ ts in an oral starting dose of 0,3 mg / kg / day to apply .
dosage adjustment in special patient groups patients with reduced Li@@ ability function Z@@ ur maintenance of blood @-@ mirror in the targeted area can be required in patients with severe liver operations a lower@@ ing of dose .
patients with reduced kid@@ ney function since the kid@@ ney function has no influence on the pharmac@@ ogen@@ ine@@ tics from Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , it can be assumed that a dosage adjustment is not required .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ otic Pot@@ enti@@ als from Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , a careful observation of the kid@@ ney function ( including a regular determination of ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in levels , a calculation of cre@@ at@@ in@@ incl@@ ine and an monitoring of the ur@@ inary tract ) .
change@@ over from Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f At the change@@ over from an Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in@@ - to a Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is caution recommended ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations on the mirror in general the dose should be primarily based on the clinical assessment of engra@@ ving and compatibility of individual loss of attorney @-@ Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ Tal@@ spiegel checks .
it is recommended frequent controls between the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Tal@@ spiegel during the first two weeks after tran@@ splan@@ tation , followed by perio@@ dical controls during development therapy .
blood @-@ mirror from Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also be modified according to conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , dosage adjustment , changes of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or for simultaneous application of substances , which could change the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us full blood @-@ zentr@@ ation ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f is a medicine with a low Clear@@ ance , adjustments of the dose may require several days until the Ste@@ ady State has been assigned .
the data in clinical studies allow that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the mirror in blood 20 n@@ g / ml cannot exceed .
in clinical practice the Tal@@ mirror of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us generally lie in the first time after liver tran@@ splan@@ ts in the range of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and with low @-@ tran@@ splan@@ ts patients at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml .
during subsequent development therapy of liver , kid@@ ney and heart tran@@ splan@@ ts were generally used blood @-@ concentration in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml .
this has led to serious undes@@ irable events , including tran@@ splan@@ ts or other side @-@ effects , which can occur in consequence of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us sub @-@ exposure .
patients should always keep the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and maintain appropriate daily dosage ; conver@@ sions of the formulation or of the regime should only be made under the nar@@ r@@ ative control of one in the tran@@ splan@@ tation ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .

further factors that increase the risk of such clin@@ ician disorders , are an already existing heart suffer , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ ster@@ oids , hyper@@ tension , kid@@ ney or liver functioning , infections , hydr@@ ation and o@@ ils .
as with other immun@@ os@@ res@@ si@@ va , the effect of sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of skin l@@ esi@@ ons by suitable clothing or use of a solar protection factor by means of a high protection factor .

the simultaneous application of drugs or herbal remedies that are known as Hem@@ mer or in@@ duc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can influence metabolism from Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and thus reduce blood levels from Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .

&quot; &quot; &quot; in the main study , the effectiveness of advent in the prevention of blood fluctu@@ ates in 86 % of 510 new blo@@ od@@ ds was awarded with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; respectively with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are Sch@@ win@@ del , head@@ ache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ie ( Fi@@ eber ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII .
advent may not be used in patients who may possibly pers@@ ensi@@ tive ( allergic ) against the human brain factor VIII , mouse or ham@@ ster protein or one of the other ingredients .
March 2004 , the European Commission shared by the company Ba@@ x@@ ter AG appro@@ ving an approval from Adv@@ ate in the entire European Union .
dosage The dosage and duration of sub@@ stitution therapy depends on the sever@@ ity of the factor VIII @-@ def@@ ect , after the place and the extent of blood flow and the clinical condition of the patient .
in the following case of Flemish events , the factor VIII activity in the corresponding period does not take place under the specified plasma surface ( in % of the standard or in i.e. / dl ) sin@@ ks .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repeat until the p@@ ains and the acoustic imp@@ air@@ ment are eliminated .
injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the danger to the patient is over .
during the treatment course , the dose of inj@@ ecting the dosage and frequency of inj@@ ections becomes an appropriate determination of the factor VIII plasma jet .
individual patients can differ in their reaction to factor VIII , different in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ pages .
3 proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis use proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of ble@@ eding in patients with severe hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 i.e. from factor VIII per kg of body weight at the distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the anticipated factor VIII enter is not achieved , or if the ble@@ eding is not domin@@ ating with a reasonable dose , a test must be carried out if necessary to em@@ ulate an In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or .
in patients with high inputs , it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures must be wo@@ unded .
the administration rate should be determined by the patient , whereby a maximum inj@@ ecting rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neut@@ ral@@ ising antibodies against factor VIII is a known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A .
these In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ ko@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII oriented Ig@@ G immun@@ og@@ lo@@ bul@@ ins , which are de@@ duc@@ ted in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Beth@@ es@@ da As@@ say .

it is a type of virus that has been gene@@ tically modified so that it can carry a gene into the body &apos;s cells .
the virus in Adv@@ oc@@ ene is a &quot; A@@ den@@ o@@ virus &quot; which was changed so that there cannot produce a copies of yourself and thus cannot prevent infections in the human being .
Adv@@ oc@@ approach would have don@@ ated directly into the tum@@ ors and allow the canc@@ erous cells to build the normal p@@ 53 @-@ protein .
the p@@ 53 protein that is made out of the not broken down in the human body available p@@ 53 @-@ gene , normally contributes to the restoration of cor@@ rupt DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered .
at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ cancer , where the p@@ 53 @-@ gene is def@@ ective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the canc@@ ers can continue to grow and share .
the company put data from a study with a patient in front of the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ cancer in the area of the sub@@ set , into the bones and in the brain .
after CH@@ MP did the answer of the company on the questions asked questions were still un@@ clear .
based on the testing of initial documentation the CH@@ MP will be created on day 120 a list of questions that will be sent to the company .
after the CH@@ MP , the inj@@ ecting of Adv@@ exin was argu@@ ed in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ore benefits for patients .
the committee also had concerns about the processing of medicinal products in the body , the nature of administration , and the security of medication .
in addition , the company had not proven sufficient to be established in a reliable way and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who arrive in close contact with the patient that is de@@ tri@@ mental .
the company did not know the CH@@ MP whether the withdrawal consequences for patients has , which are currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; Comp@@ assi@@ onate @-@ Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ exin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changing ingre@@ dient &quot; means that the tablets are so assem@@ ble that one of the effective components immediately and the other slowly released over a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;

a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effect of medication means effect on the con@@ sti@@ pation of the nose .
the main @-@ performance measurements were the changes of the sever@@ ity of the ha@@ vo@@ res of the ha@@ vo@@ irs , which were reported by the patient before the start of the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients carried their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and rated with a standard scale , how heavy the symptoms were over the last 12 hours .
in view of all the ha@@ vo@@ res of the nose , the patients , the aer@@ ob@@ ots reported the patients who took aer@@ os@@ ze over a decrease of exposure to 46,@@ 0 % , compared to 35,@@ 9 % in patients who took Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ in alone .

aer@@ os@@ ze should not be used in children under the age of 12 . aer@@ os@@ ze should not be used in children under 12 years due to the failure of the data .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not proceed after the symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the use of time to 10 days since long @-@ term application can take the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in time .

June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.r.l. the Committee for Human@@ phar@@ yn@@ x ( CH@@ MP ) officially stated that the company particip@@ ates its application for approval by A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to the prevention of avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 inf@@ lu@@ enza in adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect flu , which is caused by the tribe ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of Inf@@ lu@@ enza @-@ A @-@ virus .
this is a special kind of vaccine that should cause a tribe of the flu @-@ virus that could cause a future pan@@ dem@@ ic .
a gri@@ pp@@ ep@@ an@@ dem@@ ic breaks off when a new tribe of the Gri@@ p@@ pe@@ virus emerg@@ es that can easily spread from person to person because people do not have a imm@@ unity ( no protection ) against it .
after administration of the vaccine , the immune system uses the parts of the influ@@ enza virus as &quot; physical @-@ alien &quot; and forms the body of antibodies against it .
this is the immune system later in a position to make contact with a flu @-@ virus this pedi@@ gree more quickly .
subsequently , the membrane @-@ case of the virus with the &quot; surface area &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which sees the human body as physical @-@ alien ) , adju@@ sting and used as a part of the vaccine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a survey of some of the study centres showed that the study was not performed in accordance with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good clinical practice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( G@@ CP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , the scope of the clinical data base for assessing the security of the vaccine is not to fulfill the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre@@ pan@@ dem@@ ic vaccines .
should you take part in clinical trials and need more information about your treatment , please contact your doctor .
for more information regarding the recommendations of CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is applied in combination with other anti@@ vir@@ al medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years , associated with the human@@ os immune @-@ virus from type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) which causes the acquired immune @-@ immune syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who can &apos;t be sm@@ ells any capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution to the inser@@ tion , but these can not be taken along with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the security of this combination was not examined .
A@@ gener@@ ase should only be ordered once the doctor has checked which anti@@ vir@@ al drugs has previously taken before , and the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood has judged that the virus will address the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years amounts to 600 mg twice daily , which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and other anti @-@ vir@@ al drugs .
for children between four and twelve years and in patients with a weight of less than 50 kg the recommended dose of A@@ gener@@ ase is governed by body weight .
v@@ gener@@ ase decre@@ ases in combination with other anti@@ vir@@ al drugs the HIV @-@ quantity in the blood and keeps them on a low level .
AIDS not to heal , however , can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also delay the development of with AIDS infections and ill@@ nesses .
A@@ gener@@ ase was examined in combination with other anti@@ vir@@ al medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , examined in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adult , who had previously been treated with prot@@ ocols .
this compared with low do@@ si@@ fied rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased drug A@@ gener@@ ase was taken at 206 adults , the formerly prot@@ ocols of the former prot@@ ocols .
major indicators for the eff@@ ic@@ acy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ retard@@ ant concentr@@ ations of HIV in the blood ( Vir@@ us@@ last ) or the change of the vir@@ g@@ last after the treatment .
in studies with patients who had previously had no prot@@ agon@@ isms , even after 48 weeks under A@@ gener@@ ase more patients had a Vir@@ al last less than 400 copies / ml as plac@@ ebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
with children reduced A@@ gener@@ ase also the Vir@@ us@@ last , however , were treated by the children , who were treated earlier with prot@@ agon@@ isms , very few to the treatment .
in the study involving adults , which were treated earlier with prot@@ agon@@ isms , associated with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased drug A@@ gener@@ ase the Vir@@ us@@ last after 16 @-@ week treatment just as effective as other prot@@ ocols
in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ agon@@ ers , it came under A@@ gener@@ ase along with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger failure of the Vir@@ us@@ last after four weeks than in the patients who continued their former prot@@ ocols .
the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed with more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ( di@@ arr@@ ho@@ res ) , Flat@@ ul@@ ence ( bli@@ zz@@ ling ) , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , v@@ om@@ iting , rash and Fati@@ gue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients who may possibly pers@@ ensi@@ tive ( allergic ) against am@@ pl@@ av@@ r or one of the other ingredients .
A@@ gener@@ ase may also not be used in patients who are Johann@@ is@@ kr@@ aut ( an herbal supplement for treating depression ) or medicines that are just as v@@ gener@@ ase , and in high concentr@@ ations in the blood of health @-@ harmful are taking .
as with other medicines on HIV exists in patients , the A@@ gener@@ ase , taking the risk of a pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of the body @-@ fat ) , a oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ular ( desc@@ ending of bone tissue ) or an immune system of syn@@ dro@@ ms ( symptoms of an infection which are caused by the rest@@ ing immune system ) .
the Committee on Human@@ phar@@ yn@@ x ( CH@@ MP ) en@@ acted to the conclusion that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase in use in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines used to treat with prot@@ agon@@ isms in HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken along with pharmac@@ ogen@@ ine@@ tic amplifier , but the committee demonstrated that the use of v@@ gener@@ ase have taken in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who had previously had no prot@@ agon@@ ism before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally registered under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because at the time of approval for scientific reasons only limited information . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2000 , the European Commission for the company Gl@@ ax@@ o Group Limited was approved for approval by A@@ gener@@ ase in the whole of the European Union .
A@@ gener@@ ase is used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1- infected , prot@@ agon@@ is@@ ers ( PI ) -@@ reg@@ ated adults and children over the age of 4 .
for usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are to be administ@@ ered by phar@@ yn@@ avi@@ r in phar@@ yn@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of Am@@ pul@@ mon@@ g should take place under consideration the individual vir@@ al resistance movement and the treatment treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r as a solution to the inser@@ tion is around 14 % lower than of Am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore are A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not inter@@ change@@ able ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg of am@@ ot@@ avi@@ r twice daily with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al drugs .
2 . when A@@ gener@@ ase capsules used without the ampli@@ fying addi@@ tive of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ adding ) , higher doses should be applied to A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of am@@ ot@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al drugs up to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg Am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the pharmac@@ ogen@@ ic , effectiveness and safety of v@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ agon@@ ies were not examined in children .
A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the lack of data to harm@@ less@@ ness and effectiveness ( see Section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ogen@@ ic data the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be reduced the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules in adult suffer@@ ings at 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver functioning on 300 mg twice daily .
the simultaneous application is to be carried out in patients with mild or moderate liver functioning , in patients with severe liver functioning , it is contra@@ sting indi@@ ces ( see Section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase may not simultaneously be given to pharmac@@ euticals , who own a low therapeutic width and also depic@@ ting sub@@ str@@ ate of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ y@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal supplements which thre@@ w the Johann@@ is@@ kr@@ aut ( hyper@@ icum perfor@@ atum ) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma @-@ centr@@ ations and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of am@@ pl@@ av@@ r during the intake of am@@ pl@@ av@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy does not cause a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opport@@ un@@ istic infections or other complications of a HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy , including the treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contam@@ ination with blood .
for usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are to be used together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hep@@ atitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy , have a increased risk for severe liver effects with potentially deadly course .
for the case of simultaneous anti@@ vir@@ al treatment of hep@@ atitis B or C , please read the relevant information provided for this medicine .
patients with reduced mobility function , including a chronic @-@ active hep@@ atitis , an increased incidence of liver operations under a anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy and should be monitored according to the clinical practice .
the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ tic@@ ason or other Gl@@ uk@@ ok@@ or@@ tik@@ oids , which have become more than CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended unless the potential benefits of a treatment risk system@@ ic corro@@ sion effects including Mor@@ bus C@@ ups and Supp@@ sion of the secondary function ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since the metabolism of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ Redu@@ kt@@ ase @-@ Hem@@ mer Lov@@ ast@@ atin and sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin has been dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is a simultaneous agreement of A@@ gener@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin because of the elevated risk of My@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hu@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ sen not recommended .
4 For some medicines , which can cause serious or life @-@ threat@@ ening effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under control of the International Stand@@ ar@@ ised ratio ) , are available for the determination of the ingre@@ dient concentration .
in patients who are taking these medicines at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase can be less effective because of decre@@ pit plas@@ mas@@ ks or less effective ( see Section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of met@@ abo@@ lic interactions with Am@@ pul@@ mon@@ r can be the effectiveness of hor@@ m@@ onal contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills , however the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions .
when meth@@ ad@@ one is given simultaneously with am@@ pl@@ edges , patients should therefore be monitored on the sympt@@ om symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
due to the potential risk of tox@@ icity due to the high prop@@ yl@@ engl@@ y@@ col@@ geh@@ al@@ ts of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution to the inser@@ tion is this presentation in children under an age of four years , and should be used with caution at certain other patients .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be set on duration 5 if a rash are accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic sympt@@ om or are involved in mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es ( see Section 4.8 ) .
in patients who received an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy including prot@@ ocols , was reported on the appearance of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia or an ex@@ az@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other diseases , regarding their therapy drugs were necessary to be associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or a hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
B. higher age , and associated with anti @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment and the associated met@@ abo@@ lic disorders associated with drugs .
in case of se@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es patients ( type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ ocols , are reports of an increase in ble@@ eding including spontaneous gl@@ ut@@ as hem@@ at@@ oms and hem@@ at@@ thro@@ es .
with HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune def@@ ective patients may develop a infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory response to asym@@ pt@@ omatic or resi@@ dual opport@@ un@@ istic infections , which leads to severe clinical conditions or deteri@@ oration of symptoms .
although a multi@@ fact@@ orial e@@ ology is accepted ( including application of cor@@ tical resources , higher body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose especially in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy ( ART ) .
CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ate with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase may not simultaneously be given to pharmac@@ euticals , who own a low therapeutic width and also depic@@ ting sub@@ str@@ ate of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ y@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ate with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be mer@@ ged along with drugs whose active ingredients are primarily associated with CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with severe Plas@@ mas@@ onry with serious and / or life @-@ threat@@ ening effects .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in is caused by a 82 % reduction of AU@@ C from Am@@ pl@@ av@@ r which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ y failure and to a resistance development .
in the attempt to compens@@ ate the low plasma surface by a dosage increase of other prot@@ ease inhi@@ bit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , were very frequently undes@@ irable effects observed at the liver .
Johann@@ is@@ kr@@ aut ( hyper@@ icum perfor@@ atum ) The Ser@@ um@@ mirror of Am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r can be de@@ grad@@ ated by the simultaneous application of herbal equ@@ ations with Johann@@ is@@ kr@@ aut ( hyper@@ icum perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient is already mat@@ ured on Johann@@ is@@ kr@@ aut , are the am@@ pl@@ ush level and , if possible to review the Vir@@ us@@ last and de@@ fi@@ red the cur@@ rant .
a dosage adjustment for one of the drugs is not required if Nel@@ um@@ avi@@ r is administ@@ ered along with am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r ( see also the e@@ av@@ avi@@ on at the bottom ) .
508 % increased , for C@@ max on the other hand increased by 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with am@@ ot@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical trials , dos@@ ages of 600 mg are applied twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , which occupy the effectiveness and in@@ concei@@ vable of this treatment cin@@ emat@@ ography .
52 % lower if Am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of am@@ ot@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were obtained in the combination of am@@ ot@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ pul@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
a dosage recommendations for simultaneous administration of Am@@ pul@@ viol@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra may not be given , however , there will be a nar@@ cot@@ t monitoring , as the effectiveness and in@@ concei@@ vable of this combination is not known .
no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study was conducted for use by A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but due to the in@@ dem@@ ary component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine , is recommended that the income of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and no@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart .
therefore at gift of E@@ f@@ avi@@ on , in combination with Am@@ sw@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dosage adjustment required .
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ on in combination with Am@@ sw@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ agon@@ isms .
the effect of Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ in on other prot@@ ocols and existing limited data can be pres@@ ently that Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ in the Ser@@ um@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation of Am@@ pul@@ viol@@ r might be lowers .
if these medicines should be used simultaneously , caution is recommended as Del@@ avi@@ rd@@ in because of the reduced and possibly sub@@ therapeutic properties less effective .
when these drugs are applied together , caution is recommended ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ y monitoring should be carried out as an exact pre@@ diction of the effect of combination of am@@ pl@@ av@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ rd@@ in difficult .
the simultaneous gift of am@@ ot@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin resulted in an increase of plasma @-@ centr@@ ation ( AU@@ C ) by ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at 193 % and therefore an increase in associated with ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin @-@ effects .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons , ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin may be administ@@ ered along with A@@ gener@@ ase , becomes a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin on at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data are required .
Pharmac@@ eutical Studies with A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not conducted but could be the Plas@@ mas@@ ks of both drugs in case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol at plasma around 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ ear ) to the 2,@@ 69@@ 54 compared to the value that has been observed after 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol once a day without simultaneous application of Fos@@ amp@@ ad@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhi@@ bit@@ or in@@ duc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can occur if they are used together with A@@ gener@@ ase possibly to interactions .
patients should therefore be based on tox@@ ic reactions , associated with these medicines , if they are used in combination with A@@ gener@@ ase .
based on the data of other prot@@ agon@@ ist it is advisable that An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da are not taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase , as it can come to Res@@ or@@ p@@ tions@@ störungen .
the simultaneous application of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ si@@ va , which are known as an enz@@ y@@ de@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r can lead to a de@@ grad@@ ation of plasma jet .
the ser@@ um concentr@@ ations of calcium @-@ channel block such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , Dil@@ odi@@ pin , rocky , rocky , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin and ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by Am@@ pul@@ mon@@ r , thus increasing the activity and tox@@ icity of these drugs .
simultaneous intake involving A@@ gener@@ ase can substantially increase and increase using PD@@ E5 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors associated with PD@@ E5 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , including Hyp@@ ot@@ ension , visual dys@@ functions and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at int@@ ran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days at Pro@@ ban@@ den , sti@@ but@@ able the flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at Plas@@ tic@@ as@@ pi@@ onate ( 90 % -@@ Con@@ fi@@ den@@ z@@ interval 82 to 89 % ) .
consequently , the simultaneous gift of A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended together with these gl@@ uc@@ ok@@ or@@ tik@@ oids , unless the potential benefits of a treatment weighs the risk of system@@ ic corro@@ sive effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
at H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A conc@@ entri@@ c plugs , such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent from CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are pronoun@@ ced vali@@ d@@ ations of Plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ egel in simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase .
since Plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ egel@@ increase of these H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A re@@ membran@@ ce to My@@ opathy , including a r@@ hu@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ sis , the combined application of these medicines will not be recommended with am@@ ot@@ avi@@ r .
it will be a common monitoring of therapeutic concentr@@ ations up to stabil@@ ising the mirror since the plasma @-@ concentration of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be raised by Am@@ sw@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase may not be applied together with or@@ ally used Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) , whereas for simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase is offered with the par@@ c@@ ran@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am caution .
data for the simult@@ ani@@ ous use of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ oc@@ or@@ bit@@ ors to a possible increase in plasma cutting from Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around the 3- to 4 @-@ fold .
when meth@@ ad@@ on together with am@@ ali@@ avi@@ r should suff@@ ice , patients should therefore be monitored on the sympt@@ om of symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
because of the minimal per@@ me@@ ability of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation can currently be given as the am@@ ot@@ avi@@ ge@@ - dose is to adapt if am@@ viol@@ avi@@ r is administ@@ ered at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one .
in case of simultaneous b@@ abe of war@@ ri@@ in or other oral antibodies , together with A@@ gener@@ ase , an increased monitoring of IN@@ R ( International Stand@@ ar@@ ised ratio ) because of the possibility of a weak or rein@@ forcement of anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect . ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hor@@ m@@ onal contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills is not predic@@ table , therefore alternative methods are recommended for recep@@ tive prevention .
a careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( for example Desi@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended in simultaneous gift of A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Section 4.4 ) .
this medicine may only be used during pregnancy only after careful weighing of potential crops for the mother in comparison to the potential risks for fet@@ us .

the in@@ vari@@ ability of A@@ gener@@ ase was examined in adults and in children 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al drugs .
most connected with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment related side effects were slightly up to moderate , occurred early on and rarely brought out to treatment break@@ age .
in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are in connection with the intake of A@@ gener@@ ase or another at the same time to HIV treatment applied to HIV treatment or whether they are a result of di@@ under@@ diseases .
most of the side @-@ below side effects are from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which with prot@@ ocols did not pre @-@ treated patients 1200 mg A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily .

at the otyp@@ ical resistance @-@ based analyses of gen@@ otyp@@ ical inter@@ pret@@ ations systems can be applied to de@@ valuation of the activity of Am@@ pul@@ viol@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ocols and resistant isolation .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance than the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I , V@@ 8@@ 2A , V@@ 8@@ 2A / C / F / G , I@@ 54@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2A / C / F / G , I@@ 54@@ V , and a decreased lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood of a vi@@ uro@@ logical response ( resistance ) .
the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to changes through additional data , and it is recommended to keep up the current inter@@ pret@@ ations for analysis of the results of resistance tests .
on ph@@ al @-@ otyp@@ ical resistance @-@ based analyses clin@@ ically vali@@ dated ph@@ or@@ otyp@@ ical inter@@ pret@@ ations can be used in conjunction with the gen@@ otyp@@ ical data for the assessment of the activity of Am@@ pul@@ mon@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ocols and resistant isolation .
companies , the diagnostic preservation tests , have clin@@ ically developed @-@ phenomen@@ al cut @-@ off@@ s ( Divi@@ der ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be applied to the interpretation of results of a resistance test .
each of these four with a reduced sensitivity against am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r associ@@ ative genetic patterns creates a certain cruci@@ ble against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity against In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ av@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r but generally still preserved .
there are currently data on the cross @-@ resistant between Am@@ nest@@ y and other prot@@ agon@@ isms for all 4 Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r Resi@@ st@@ enz@@ l , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .

the early de@@ preci@@ ation of a silver therapy is recommended to hold the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in borders , which can affect the following treatment .
the cover of the effectiveness of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ised open trial ( 600 mg twice daily ) and nuclear therapy ( R@@ R@@ TI ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , so@@ C ) with a PI , predomin@@ antly with lowest ritual . &quot;
one hundred @-@ three @-@ six@@ ty @-@ core ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the sub@@ section A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis presented the non @-@ subj@@ ection of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the So@@ C @-@ PI Group in terms of the time @-@ imposed aver@@ ing ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in Plas@@ ma after 16 weeks , in Plas@@ ma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ leg@@ acies of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the cover of the effectiveness of in@@ geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ tem A@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled studies with the total of 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 years , of which 152 were treated with PI .
in the studies of A@@ gener@@ ase solution for taking and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
it was given no low do@@ si@@ fied rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of the patients treated with PI had previously had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) who were given to the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s along with A@@ gener@@ ase .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of the patients included a Plas@@ ma HIV @-@ RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml with a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 @-@ cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the output value .
19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 19 Basi@@ cally on this data should be considered at the therapy optimization with PI of the benefit of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ tem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after oral administration , the average duration ( T@@ max ) is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
508 % increased , for C@@ max that is reduced by 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) together with Am@@ sw@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of am@@ ot@@ avi@@ r with a meal results in a 25 % total decrease of AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ pul@@ mon@@ y 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady @-@ State ( C@@ min , ss ) influenced by the food intake , although the simultaneous food intake influences the scale and the rate of res@@ or@@ ption .
the seem@@ ing distribution volume is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and leaves on a large distribution volume , as well as an enormous penetration of am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r from the blood circulation into the tissues .
this change leads to a decrease of the total concentration of the drug in plasma , with the amount of un@@ common amp@@ ot@@ avi@@ r that represents the active part , probably remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ question@@ able am@@ ot@@ avi@@ r remains unchanged , the percentage percentage of the free active component in dependence on the consumption levels in the Ste@@ ady @-@ State over the area of C@@ max , ss up to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , drugs , the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 will indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit or a sub@@ str@@ ate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , be administ@@ ered with caution if they are given simultaneously with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar day am@@ ot@@ avi@@ r Ex@@ pos@@ ure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily .
Am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r is made up of the solution 14 % less bio@@ availability than from the capsules ; therefore are A@@ gener@@ ase solution and no@@ gener@@ ase capsules not inter@@ change@@ able .
also the ren@@ al clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is negl@@ ected , therefore the impact of a kid@@ ney function is likely to be low to the elimination of am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
this treatment sch@@ em@@ ata lead to am@@ ot@@ avi@@ r plasma jet , comparable to healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg am@@ ot@@ avi@@ r twice daily without simultaneous appointments of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies for can@@ v@@ elling with am@@ ot@@ avi@@ r on mi@@ ce and rats may appear with male animals be@@ ig@@ ne hep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular A@@ den@@ ome in doses adapted to the 2,0 @-@ lateral ( mi@@ ce ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - lateral ( rat ) of exposure to people , according to twice daily G@@ abe of 1200 mg am@@ pl@@ av@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of hep@@ at@@ oc@@ ular A@@ den@@ om@@ es and car@@ cin@@ oma has not yet been raised and the relevance of this observed effects for man is un@@ clear .
however , from the present ex@@ posi@@ tional data on people , both from clinical studies as well as of clinical use , however , however little hints for the acceptance of a clinical relevance of this survey .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity tests , the bacter@@ ial test tests ( am@@ it test ) , mouse @-@ lym@@ ph@@ oma test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chro@@ mos@@ ome lym@@ pho@@ cy@@ tes , was am@@ us@@ avi@@ r neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ically .
this liver tox@@ icity can be monitored in clinical life by measuring AS@@ T , AL@@ T and the activity of al@@ kal@@ ische phosph@@ at@@ ase .
so far in clinical studies has not been observed no significant liver tox@@ icity in patients , either during the administration of A@@ gener@@ ase , nor after the end of the treatment .
studies on tox@@ icity in juven@@ iles , which were treated from an age of 4 days showed both in control and with the tre@@ ati@@ c@@ av@@ r treat@@ able animals a high Mort@@ ality .
with a system@@ ic Plas@@ ma@@ ex@@ position which was significant ( rats ) as the expected ex@@ position under therapeutic dosage in humans , however , have been observed a number of minor changes including thy@@ bit@@ el@@ ong@@ ation and low sk@@ elet@@ on changes observed , which refer to a consumed development .
24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules used without the ampli@@ fying addi@@ tive of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ adding ) , higher doses should be applied to A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .

the European medicines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) is given every year all new information that may be known , check and update this summary .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used to watch the al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me , with regard to the reactions to the inf@@ usion and the development of antibodies .
June 2003 , the European Commission shared the Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe BV . a permit for the transfer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me throughout the European Union .
Lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human@@ istic α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ oni@@ d@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ DNA technology using Ch@@ o @-@ Mamm@@ als @-@ Zell@@ cultures ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ vary , E@@ ier@@ stock of Chinese Ham@@ sters ) .

the treatment of al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a doctor who possesses the experience in treating patients with MP@@ S I or other her@@ edit@@ ary metabolism .
the initial inf@@ usion rate of 2 e / kg / h can be increased if the patient carries this to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and effectiveness of al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined and for these patients no dos@@ ing scheme may be recommended .
the safety and effectiveness of al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me in patients with kid@@ ney or liver in@@ suff@@ l@@ ence has not been determined and for these patients there can be no dos@@ ing scheme .
with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated patients may develop inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions , which are defined as any related side effect , which occurs during inf@@ usion or until the end of the inf@@ usion ( see Section 4.8 ) .
for this reason especially these patients should continue to be monitored nar@@ row@@ ly monitored , and inf@@ usion of inf@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in a reasonable clinical setting , in which rev@@ ital@@ isation institutions will be available immediately .
due to the clinical phase @-@ 3 study , we expect to form nearly all patients Ig@@ G antibodies against Lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of a inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution in use by Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
as little experience regarding the res@@ um@@ ption of treatment after a longer break , must be cau@@ tious due to the theore@@ tically increased risk response to a inter@@ ruption of treatment .
60 minutes before the on@@ usion of inf@@ usion with medication ( anti@@ hist@@ amine and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ tika ) to minimize the potential impact inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions .
in the event of a light or moderate inf@@ ant @-@ related reaction , the treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amine should be issued and / or a reduction in inf@@ usion rate at half of the inf@@ usion in which the reaction has occurred .
in the case of a single , heavy inf@@ usion @-@ conditional reaction , the inf@@ usion has to be stopped until the symptoms are decrease , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered .
inf@@ usion can be used with a reduction in inf@@ usion rate at 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the inf@@ usion rate , performed in response to reaction .

al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain because a potential risk of interference with in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular image of lar@@ v@@ ases .
animal experim@@ entation studies do not leave direct or indirect impact on pregnancy , the embry@@ onic development , birth and post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
since no data on new@@ born , which were exposed to Lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase over the mother &apos;s milk , is recommended , during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me not to bre@@ ast@@ feed .
the effects in clinical trials were predomin@@ antly classified as inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions , which were observed at 53 % of patients in the phase 3 @-@ study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years of age ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) .
unwanted medicines related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were observed during the phase @-@ 3 study and its extension in a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older at a treatment duration of up to 4 years , are frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; often ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe MP@@ S @-@ I @-@ related involvement of the upper breathing paths and l@@ ungs in the pre@@ history , in addition serious reactions to , including bron@@ chi@@ ev@@ m , breathing and fac@@ i@@ ties ( see Section 4.4 ) .
children &apos;s medicines in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a ph@@ as@@ - 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years , with predomin@@ antly heavy duty form and a treatment duration up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg of intra@@ ven@@ ous once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg of intra@@ ven@@ ous once a week , 200 E / kg of intra@@ ven@@ ous every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg of intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
in most patients it came to a ser@@ oc@@ c version within 3 months after the start of the treatment , whereby it came to patients aged under 5 with a severe reference form ( average after 26 days over 45 days in patients aged 5 years and older ) .
up to the end of the phase @-@ 3 study ( or up to a premature retirement from the study ) in 13 / 45 patients suffer from radi@@ o@@ immun@@ o@@ rec@@ itation ( RI@@ P ) As@@ unci@@ ations , including 3 patients , in which there had never been to ser@@ oc@@ c version .
patients suffering from low anti@@ body mirror for a robust de@@ tri@@ ment of the G@@ AG Spi@@ eg@@ els in Har@@ n , while in patients with high anti @-@ bodies an variable lower@@ ing of G@@ AG in Har@@ n was to be noticed .
four patients ( three in the phase @-@ 3 study and one in the Phase 2 study ) showed a margin@@ ally until low neutral inhi@@ bit@@ ory activity on enzym@@ atic Lar@@ oni@@ zation activity in vit@@ ro , which seemed to not affect the clinical effectiveness and / or the reduction of G@@ AG in the Har@@ n .
the presence of antibodies did not seem to stand in connection with the incidence of undes@@ irable drug transactions , even if the appearance of undes@@ irable drug transactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reason for the En@@ z@@ ym@@ osis therapy is in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the ak@@ c@@ umul@@ ated sub@@ str@@ ate and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient enzym@@ es .
after intra@@ ven@@ ous inf@@ usion , Lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase is quickly removed from the circulation and of cells in the lym@@ ph@@ omas , most likely over Mann@@ ose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
the safety and effectiveness of al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me were examined in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blin@@ ded , plac@@ ebo phase @-@ 3 study on 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years .
although patients were re@@ printed for the study dedicated to the entire sick@@ ness spectrum , the majority of patients were on the middle of the medium size and only a patient turned to the heavy prototype .
patients were re@@ printed if they had a resear@@ ched exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ min@@ ut@@ ary test .
all patients were subsequently presented for an open @-@ label extension that they were used for further 3,5 years ( 182 weeks ) each week 100 E / kg of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
after 26 weeks of therapy , the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated patients compared to the plac@@ ebo group an improvement of the pul@@ mon@@ ary function and the gran@@ de@@ ability shown in the table below .
in the open extension study the improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in der@@ al@@ dur@@ y@@ me / al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me group and of 182 weeks in the plac@@ ebo / al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me group , as out of the following table .
the acceptance of the percentage % FE@@ V is not significant over this period of clin@@ ically not significant and the absolute lung vol@@ um@@ ina increased further propor@@ tionally to the height of growing children .
from 26 patients with a hep@@ atitis , treated before treatment 22 ( 85 % ) to the end of the study a normal liver size .
within the first four weeks a significant decline of the G@@ AG @-@ Spiegel represented in the Har@@ n ( µ@@ g / mg of Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) which remained constantly up to the study .
regarding the het@@ ero@@ gene@@ ous illness of disease among patients committed by using a combined end@@ point adjustment system , is generally considered an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deteri@@ oration with 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year @-@ year @-@ 2 study conducted in which mainly the security and pharmac@@ ogen@@ ic ine@@ tics was examined by Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me in 20 patients who were at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years old ( 16 patients with the heavy pun@@ ching form ) and 4 with the intermediate circuit form ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased due to increased G@@ AG@@ - mirror at the Har@@ n in week 22 in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg .
for several patients there was an end growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) determined to the Z @-@ Score for this age group The younger patients with the middle or@@ bit form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and every 4 patients with the middle or@@ bit has limited a normal mental speed vel@@ ocity to the older patients with severe in@@ feed form , or not in no progress in co@@ gni@@ tive development .
in a phase @-@ 4 study , exam@@ inations at pharmac@@ od@@ ynam@@ ic effects of different al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me @-@ met@@ ering sch@@ em@@ ata were carried out at the G@@ AG mirror in the Har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
100 E / kg of intra@@ ven@@ ous once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg of intra@@ ven@@ ous once a week , 200 E / kg of intra@@ ven@@ ous every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg of intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dos@@ ing scheme with 200 E / kg of intra@@ ven@@ ous every 2 weeks can be in patients who have difficulties with weekly inf@@ usions , a represent@@ ati@@ able alternative ; however , is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two doses is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate every new information , which will be available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated .

Alim@@ ta is applied together with cis@@ pl@@ atin ( an other medicines for cancer ) in patients who have not been removed from cancer ( drugs to cancer ) and &quot; Mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( mal@@ ign@@ ant - cancer ) is already easily matched to other parts of the body ) . • the advanced or metastatic &quot; non@@ violent &quot; lung cancer who have not att@@ acking the record cells .
Alim@@ ta is not treated with patients previously , in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chem@@ o@@ therapies , then applied as a few therapy .
to decrease side effects should patients during treatment with Alim@@ ta a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( one vitamin ) and inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
if Alim@@ ta is administ@@ ered along with cis@@ pl@@ atin , should be given before or after the gift of cis@@ pl@@ atin additionally a &quot; anti@@ em@@ e@@ tikum &quot; ( medicines for v@@ om@@ iting ) and liquids ( in order to bend a hydr@@ ation ) .
in patients whose ble@@ eding changes have changed or when certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be up@@ lifted , ab@@ duc@@ ted or the dose may be reduced .
the active form of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed promp@@ ted the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells divide .
the transformation of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed into its active form is easier to equi@@ p cancer cells than in healthy cells , which leads to higher concentr@@ ations of active form of pharmac@@ euticals and a longer activity of cancer cells .
for the treatment of the mal@@ ig@@ ar Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ oms , Alim@@ ta was examined in a main study of 456 patients who had previously received any chem@@ otherapy against their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ t@@ onal lung cancer the effects of Alim@@ ta was treated in a study at 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease , which previously had been treated with chem@@ otherapy with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( a different medicine against cancer ) .
Alim@@ ta was also compared with Gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( a further medicine against cancer ) , and both in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin in a study on 1 725 patients who had previously had no chem@@ otherapy for lung cancer .
patients who were treated with Alim@@ ta and cis@@ pl@@ atin survived on average 12,@@ 1 months , compared to 9.6 months at the all@@ ergy of cis@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who had previously received an chem@@ otherapy was the average surplus @-@ life with Alim@@ ta 8,@@ 3 months , compared with 7,@@ 9 months at doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
however , in both studies , patients , where cancer does not apply the record epi@@ th@@ eli@@ um cells , in administration of Alim@@ ta longer survival times than with the compar@@ ative medicine .
September 2004 , the European Commission shared the company El@@ i L@@ illy Neder@@ land B.@@ V. is a permit for the transfer of Alim@@ ta to the whole European Union .
each passage must be raised with 4,@@ 2 ml 0.9 % iger ca@@ di@@ chlori@@ de inj@@ ecting solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary Do@@ or sis is taken from the passage bottle and with 0.9 % iger sodium chlori@@ de inj@@ ecting solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml further dil@@ uted ( see Section 6.6 ) .
ALI@@ M@@ TA is in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin , in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin , in the first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic bron@@ chi@@ al cardi@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .

during the seven days before the first dose P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must be taken at least 5 cans of fo@@ lic acid and the intake must continue throughout the therap@@ ist and for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients must also have an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week before the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed dosage and after each third level of treatment .
in patients who receive P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should be created before each gift , a full screen image created , including a differenti@@ ation of the leu@@ co@@ cy@@ tes and a Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oo@@ cy@@ te .

at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dosage ex@@ am must take place in the case of failure of the N@@ adi@@ r of the blood @-@ picture or the maximum not @-@ h@@ ä@@ mat@@ ological tox@@ icity of the predic@@ tive therapy cycles .
after recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are applicable for ALI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria comply with the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ icity C@@ rit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC Grad 2 Blut@@ ung .
if patients should not develop non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ≥ 3 degrees 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity ) , the therapy has to be interrupted by ALI@@ M@@ TA until the patient has the value before treatment
the treatment with ALI@@ M@@ TA must be canc@@ eled if in patients after 2 dose @-@ reduced tox@@ icity or non @-@ h@@ ä@@ mat@@ ological tox@@ icity or non @-@ h@@ ä@@ mat@@ ological tox@@ icity or no - continue at the appearance of degrees 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
clinical studies have no indication that in patients aged 65 years - or in comparison to patients aged under 65 years of age , there is an increased anc@@ ill@@ ary risk .
ALI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to non @-@ sufficient data to improve and effectiveness .
in clinical trials in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min no dosage adjustment necessary , which go beyond all patients recommended dosage adjustment .
the data base for patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance from less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore , the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver dys@@ functions of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ phase of the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - border value and / or trans@@ am@@ in@@ as@@ en@@ arians from &gt; 3,@@ 0 @-@ increments of the upper lim@@ iting value ( in availability of liver metastatic ) not especially examined in studies .
patients must be monitored in terms of bone mar@@ tial repres@@ sion and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must not be administ@@ ered in patients before their absolute Ne@@ utri@@ ents will resume a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ o- speed has again achieved a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose @-@ reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adir of the absolute Ne@@ utri@@ ents and maximum non @-@ h@@ olog@@ ic tox@@ icity , as they observed in the prec@@ eding treatment cycles . ( see Section 4.2 ) .
a lower tox@@ icity and a reduction of degrees 3 / 4 h@@ ä@@ mat@@ ological and ni@@ ch@@ th@@ ological tox@@ icity , such as neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie and infection with degrees 3 / 4 Ne@@ utri@@ ents has been inf@@ ectious , if a pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
therefore all patients must be dependent with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed patients , fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a proph@@ es@@ y measure for reduction treated @-@ conditioned tox@@ icity ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium ri@@ dis @-@ heart failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid simultaneous @-@ ster@@ o@@ id@@ al anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and min@@ des@@ - to be avoided 2 days after treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
all patients , for which a therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed is intended , the intake of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ time spent for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
many patients , in which these events occurred , such risk factors had such risk factors for the appearance of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hyper@@ tension or Diabetes .
therefore in patients with clin@@ ically significant liquid @-@ hydr@@ ation - accumulation in the trans@@ cell@@ ular space a Dra@@ inage of take before the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment will be wo@@ unded .
5 serious cardi@@ ovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ din@@ ary events , and cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cul@@ ary events have been reported in clinical trials with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed occasionally , if this ingre@@ dient is usually administ@@ ered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ical drug .
for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated life @-@ materials ( except Gel@@ b@@ fi@@ eber , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ tra@@ yed ) not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of ir@@ reversible skull frac@@ turing the reproductive @-@ ability by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be pointed out before the treatment course to obtain advice regarding the sperm count .
in patients with normal kid@@ ney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) can high doses of non@@ ster@@ o@@ id@@ al anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds , like I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ic acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1,3 g daily ) to a reduced p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ex@@ cre@@ tion with the result of a multip@@ lic@@ ing of side effects .
therefore , caution is recommended if in patients with normal kid@@ ney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or Ac@@ e- t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ic acid in high dosage .
I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ - acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and min@@ des@@ - to be avoided 2 days after treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.4 ) .
as there is no data regarding the Inter@@ action potential as with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ time @-@ time like Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or Ro@@ f@@ ec@@ ox@@ i@@ b , the simultaneous application must be avoided with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - xed to be avoided .
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the sense status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between or@@ alen antibodies and ant@@ ine@@ oplastics . an increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International Stand@@ ar@@ ised Ratio ) if the decision was made to treat the patients with or@@ alen antibodies .
there are no data for the use of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed in Schw@@ ang@@ ers , but as with an@@ de@@ - def@@ ect an@@ tim@@ eters are expected in the pregnancy severe birth defects .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should not be used during pregnancy , except if strictly exhaus@@ tive and careful loading of the utility for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see Section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of ir@@ reversible inj@@ ecting the reproductive @-@ ability is made by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be pointed out before the treatment course to bring advice regarding the sperm service .
it is not known whether P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed into the mother &apos;s milk and unwanted effects in embro@@ i@@ ded inf@@ ants can not be excluded .

the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly Gastro@@ intest@@ inal nature and hang together with the pharmac@@ ological effect of the medication by means of the absorption of absorbed b@@ ills is prevented .
the gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal side @-@ effects were measured from clinical studies with Or@@ list@@ at 60 mg using a duration of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary .
the frequencies are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( Frequ@@ ently on the basis of the available data is not estimated ) .
the frequency of the well @-@ known side @-@ effects that were determined after the market introduction by Or@@ list@@ at , is not known , since these events are voluntarily reported by a population of un@@ certain size .
† There is pl@@ au@@ si@@ bly to cause the treatment with all@@ i to so@@ cl@@ amps with regard to possible or actual gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal side effects .
sub@@ p@@ ants of 800 mg of or@@ list@@ at and multip@@ lier of up to 400 mg three times a day were added over a period of 15 days to a normal and overweight prob@@ abil@@ ising , without significant clinical trial .
in the majority of cases reported by Or@@ list@@ at @-@ over@@ dose , no side effects or similar side effects were reported at the recommended dose of Or@@ list@@ at .
based on research on humans and animals can be derived from a fast return @-@ scale system@@ ic effects that are derived from the desired properties of Or@@ list@@ at .
the therapeutic effect continues in the lum@@ ens of the stomach and the top small intest@@ ine by co@@ al@@ ente ag@@ eing to the active Ser@@ in @-@ rest of the gast@@ ric and pan@@ cre@@ atic lips .
from clinical studies have been derived that 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , three times a day , the absorption of approximately 25 % of the dietary course is blocked .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ized , plac@@ ebo trials of adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 , the effectiveness of 60 mg of Or@@ list@@ at , was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ the@@ or@@ ical , fet@@ ched diet .
the primary parameter , the modification of the body weight in relation to the output value ( at the time of the fix@@ ation ) , has been evaluated as follows : as a variation of the body weight in studying ( table 1 ) and as the proportion of those study participants have lost more than 5 % of their initial weight ( table 2 ) .
although in both studies the weight reduction of 12 months has been observed , the largest weight loss appeared in the first 6 months .
the average change in the overall ch@@ oline was with Or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 2,4 % ( output worth 5,@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with plac@@ ebo + 2,8 % ( output worth 5,@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .

Alo@@ xi is applied by Chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ien , which are strong trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( like cis@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as with chem@@ o@@ therapies that are excessive trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( like Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , d@@ ox@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in or Car@@ b@@ opl@@ atin ) .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the additional gift of a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine which can be used as an anti@@ em@@ etic ) .

Alo@@ xi has been studied in three main studies at 1 8@@ 42 adults , who received chemical therapies that have strong or excessive trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting .
with chem@@ otherapy , the strong trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting are showed 59 % of the patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi , in the 24 hours after chem@@ otherapy no reduce ( 132 von 223 ) , compared with 57 % of patients with On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron @-@ treated patients ( 126 of 221 ) .
with chem@@ otherapy , the excessive trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting , 81 % of the patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi , in the 24 hours following chem@@ otherapy ( 153 from 189 ) , compared to 69 % of patients with On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron @-@ treated patients ( 127 of 185 ) .

Alo@@ xi is inde@@ xed to the prevention of serious nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting in strong em@@ eto@@ genic chem@@ otherapy due to canc@@ el@@ ation and prevention of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting in v@@ eto@@ genic chem@@ otherapy due to cancer .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi is used for prevention of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting that is in@@ duced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chem@@ otherapy , can be ampli@@ fied by adding one before the Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the Dick@@ dar@@ m@@ passage , patients should be monitored with an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ al col@@ ob@@ or or signs of a subtle I@@ le@@ us after the injection @-@ mining machine .
as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 Ant@@ ag@@ onists , however , caution is taken care of simultaneous tuning of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron to pharmac@@ euticals , which pro@@ long the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which Q@@ t@@ - interval is prolon@@ ged , or which tend to be an extension .
apart from connection with another chem@@ otherapy , Alo@@ xi should neither be used to prevent chem@@ otherapy for the treatment of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting .
in pre@@ clinical studies inhi@@ bited Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron the against tum@@ ors judicial activity of the five inter@@ connected chemical therapeu@@ tics not ( Cis@@ pl@@ atin , Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , Cy@@ clo@@ ab@@ in , D@@ ox@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in and Mit@@ omy@@ cin C ) .
in a clinical study did not prove a significant pharmac@@ ogen@@ ic interaction between a unique intra@@ ven@@ ous dose Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady @-@ stat@@ e- concentration or@@ alen met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ ami@@ ds , a CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors .
in one on a population based pharmac@@ ogen@@ ic analysis was shown that the simultaneous gift of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors ( Ami@@ o@@ dar@@ on , C@@ ini@@ dine , Peri@@ odi@@ din , R@@ end@@ s@@ ine , rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , Ser@@ tr@@ alin and Ter@@ ap@@ af@@ in ) had no significant impact on the clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experience for the use of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron for human pregn@@ anci@@ es are not before , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used at Schw@@ ang@@ ers , unless it is considered to be treated as required by the doctor .
in clinical studies the most commonly used in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams to observed side effects ( total 6@@ 33 patients ) , which at least possibly were with alo@@ xi in connection , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and trol@@ ley ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of over @-@ sensitivity actions and reactions to the destination ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were given in post @-@ marketing experiences .
in the group with the highest dosage indicated similar frequency of un@@ favourable events as in the other dos@@ ing groups ; there were no dose @-@ active relationships .
there have been no di@@ aly@@ sis studies because of the large distribution volume , however , is probably no effective therapy at a Alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dose .
in two random@@ ised double bl@@ ind@@ ented studies have been compared with ≤ 50 mg / m2 , Car@@ b@@ opl@@ atin , ≤ 1,@@ 500 mg / m2 of cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , and 100 mg / m2 ( half @-@ time 4 hours ) or 100 mg dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ time 7,@@ 3 hours ) , which was given to Day 1 without D@@ ex@@ ame@@ th@@ ason intra@@ ven@@ ous intra@@ ven@@ ous .
in a random@@ ised double bl@@ ind@@ stu@@ ds the total of 667 patients , who received a strong em@@ eto@@ genic chem@@ otherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ zin , as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , with patients compared to which 32 mg On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron received that were given on Day 1 intra@@ ven@@ ous .
results of the studies with default em@@ eto@@ genic chem@@ otherapy and the study with strong em@@ eto@@ genic chem@@ otherapy are summar@@ ized in the following tables .
in clinical studies on the indication of chem@@ otherapy in@@ duced nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) were the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the respective effects of On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron comparable .
after the pres@@ um@@ ented studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block at v@@ entri@@ cular DE@@ - and Rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation involved and pro@@ long the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study carried out in 221 healthy volunteers , was the assessment of the EC@@ G effects of i.@@ v. administ@@ ered Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in retail@@ er of 0,25 , 0,75 and 2,25 mg .
Res@@ or@@ ption Up intra@@ ven@@ ous fer@@ mentation follows an initi@@ ating the plasma centr@@ ations a slow Eli@@ min@@ ation from the body with an average termin@@ als half @-@ time @-@ time of about 40 hours .
the average maximum Plas@@ mak@@ on@@ zentr@@ ation ( C@@ max ) and the area below the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally proportional to the entire dosage range of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ g / kg in case of circular and canc@@ ers .
after intra@@ ven@@ ous G@@ abe of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the average number of 11 tes@@ ticle cardi@@ ac patients between day 1 and day 5 measured medium ( ± SD ) increase of the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron @-@ Plas@@ ser@@ on@@ zentr@@ ation at 42 ± 34 % .
from pharmac@@ ogen@@ ine@@ tic sim@@ ulations come forth , that at once a daily intra@@ ven@@ ous casting of 0,25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on 3 consecutive days achieved total of 0.75 mg reported value ; however , the C@@ max was higher after the default of 0,75 mg .
about 40 % are eliminated about the kid@@ neys and some more 50 % are converted into two primary met@@ abo@@ lic disorders that are compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron over less than 1 % of the ant@@ agon@@ istic impact on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 recept@@ ors .
in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ studies on met@@ abo@@ lic studies have shown that CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and , in inferior size , the I@@ so@@ enz@@ y@@ me CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 at the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are involved .
elimination of a intra@@ ven@@ ous individual dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron became approximately 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as an un@@ altered ingre@@ dient made about 40 % of the given dose .
after a unique intra@@ ven@@ ous bol@@ ster , the total physical activity is 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
while in patients with severe liver functioning the termin@@ ale elimination of Eli@@ min@@ ation time and the average system@@ ic exposure with Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron increases , a reduction of dose is however un@@ justified .
in pre @-@ clinical trials , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions which can be seen enough about the maximum human therapeutic effect , which indicates a low relevance for clinical use .
10 From pre@@ clinical trials are evidence that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can block only in very high concentr@@ ations of I@@ on@@ ary channels and re@@ lies in the v@@ entri@@ cular DE@@ - and Rep@@ ol@@ ari@@ zation and can extend the potentials of the action .
high doses Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( any dose ent@@ ails in approximately the 30@@ ples of therapeutic exposure to humans ) , which were given daily over two years , led to an increased incidence of liver , end@@ ok@@ r@@ ines , pan@@ cre@@ as , pan@@ cre@@ atic , pan@@ cre@@ as , pan@@ ni@@ eren@@ mark ) and skin tum@@ ors with rats , however not with mi@@ ce .
the underlying mechanisms are not completely known , but due to the used high doses and since Alo@@ xi is intended for the unique application , the relevance of these results is low evaluated for the human being .

June 2006 , the Committee on Human@@ phar@@ yn@@ x ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a neg@@ atives in which the approval of the approval for the treatment of hep@@ atitis C used by Alph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml inj@@ ecting solution was recommended .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that al@@ eon a biological medicine called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A is similar to the same therapeutic effect that is already approved in the EU ( also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference therapeutic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Alph@@ eon was used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ sustained ) hep@@ atitis C ( one through a virus infection .
in a micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic examination , the liver tissue samples also indicates the values of the liver y@@ ms Al@@ an@@ in@@ - Amin@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) in the blood standard .

the manufacturer of Alph@@ eon placed data before , which en@@ closures the comparison of Alph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( drug structure , composition and purity of medicinal products , effectiveness , safety and effectiveness at hep@@ atitis C ) .
in the study of patients with hep@@ atitis C , the effectiveness of Alph@@ eon was compared to the effectiveness of reference phar@@ ma by 455 patients .
in the study , how many patients were reported after 12 from a total of 48 treatment weeks as well as 6 months after the treatment of the treatment on the drug ( i.e. no signs of virus in blood ) .

furthermore , concerns have expressed concerns that the data for the stability of the drug and the market @-@ market have not been in@@ sufficient .
the number of patients infected with hep@@ atitis C , which spoke to the treatment with Alph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar in clinical study .
after setting the treatment with Alph@@ eon fl@@ amm@@ ed the disease in more patients compared to the reference phar@@ ma ; additionally , al@@ eon had more side effects .
apart from that , the testing performed in the study tests for exam@@ ining the question , however the drug is an immune response ( i.e. the body forms anti@@ body - special proteins - against the drug ) dis@@ sol@@ ves not sufficiently vali@@ dated .
it may be used for treating im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( one with Kru@@ ary @-@ formation in@@ coming skin infection ) and small in@@ fied la@@ zy ( R@@ iss@@ - or Schn@@ it@@ tw@@ unden ) , dis@@ car@@ ed and gen@@ dered wo@@ unds .
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections , which per@@ tin@@ ently or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant to hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Al@@ ar@@ go against this kind of infections might not work .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied in patients from the age of nine months , yet in patients under 18 years of age , which may not exceed 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient speaks not on the treatment after two to three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking of bacter@@ ial Ri@@ bos@@ om@@ es ( the parts of the bacter@@ ial cells in which proteins are produced ) and thereby inhi@@ bit the growth of bacteria .
Haupt@@ indi@@ k@@ ator of the effectiveness came in all five studies of the proportion of patients , their infection was bott@@ led after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of 139 patients decreased by Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2,@@ 1 % ) of 71 patients to plac@@ ebo for the treatment .
in the treatment of infected persons , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ efal@@ exin showed similar contact : if the results of both studies have been taken together with the hood issues , approximately 90 % of the patients of both groups were raised to the treatment .
however , in these two studies , however , was noted that Al@@ tar@@ go was caused in the treatment of di@@ so@@ aps ( eit@@ er@@ ge@@ arious bri@@ cks in the body tissues ) or infections , which have been caused by MR@@ SA was not effective enough .
the most common side @-@ effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is an irrit@@ ation at the job place .
the Committee on Human@@ phar@@ yn@@ x ( CH@@ MP ) finished to the conclusion that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go in the short @-@ term treatment of the following super@@ ficial skin infections towards the risks : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • in@@ fir@@ med small inc@@ iner@@ ation , de@@ ed or gen@@ dered wo@@ unds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission shared the company Gl@@ ax@@ o Group Ltd . a permit for the transfer of Al@@ tar@@ go in the whole of the European Union .
patients in which two or three days no improvement shows , should be examined once more and will be considered an alternative therapy ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in the event of a sensi@@ tization or severe local confusion due to the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be , the treatment should be canc@@ eled , the sal@@ be carefully de@@ con@@ dense and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection can be started .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known as exhaus@@ tive or susp@@ ected ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials at secondary open wo@@ unds the effectiveness of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin was caused by patients with infections , which were caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in resistant st@@ ack@@ ar@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) , in@@ sufficient .
an alternative therapy is to be considered , if after a 2- to 3 @-@ day treatment do not enter a crew or a deteri@@ oration of the infected .
the impact of simultaneous application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical funds on the same skin surface has not been investigated and the simultaneous use of other top@@ ical drugs is not recommended .
due to the small plastic @-@ concentration camps , which were reached with people after top@@ ical application on de@@ ported skin or infected super@@ ficial wo@@ unds , is a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo not to be expected ( see Section 5.2 ) .

ambi@@ rix becomes protection against hep@@ atitis A and hep@@ atitis B ( diseases that concern the liver ) in children between the ages of 1 and 15 , not im@@ mu@@ n against these two diseases .
ambi@@ rix is applied within the framework of one of two doses existing vaccines , whereby a protection against hep@@ atitis B could only be achieved after administration of the second dose .
for this reason ambi@@ tions may only be used when imm@@ uni@@ zation a low risk of hep@@ atitis B infection and is ensured that the existing vaccine can be brought into an end from two doses .
if a re@@ fres@@ her dose against hep@@ atitis A or B is desired , Ambi@@ rix or another hep@@ atitis A or B vaccine will be given .
vaccines work by elimin@@ ating the immune system ( the natural def@@ ende of the body ) , &quot; as it can cure against a disease .
once a child has received the vaccine , the immune system re@@ alizes the viruses and surface @-@ anti@@ gens as a &quot; alien &quot; and produces antibodies against it .
ambi@@ rix contains the same ingredients as approved since 1996 approved by Twin@@ rix adults and the associated vaccine Twin@@ rix children since 1997 .
the three vaccines are applied to the protection against the same diseases but Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix kids are administ@@ ered within one of three cans of existing vaccine .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data which support the application of Twin@@ rix adults , also used as cover for applying ambi@@ rix .
the main indi@@ k@@ ator for the eff@@ ic@@ acy was the proportion of the vacc@@ inated children , who had developed a protective anti@@ body after one month after the last inj@@ ecting .
in an additional study with 208 children the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared to a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month distance between the two inj@@ ections .
ambi@@ tions led up between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children a month after the last injection on the development of protective soli@@ ds against hep@@ atitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of ambi@@ rix on a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month distance between inj@@ ections was similar .
the most common side effects of ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vacc@@ ination ) are head@@ ache , pe@@ pe@@ on , red@@ ness , mat@@ s ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
ambi@@ tions may not be used for patients who may possibly pers@@ ensi@@ tive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other ingredients or ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibi@@ otic ) , not being used .
August 2002 , the European Commission shared the company Gl@@ ax@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ olog@@ icals s.@@ a. a permit for the transportation of Ambi@@ rix not all over the world
the stand@@ ar@@ dis@@ ation plan for the Grun@@ di@@ mm@@ ers@@ zation with ambi@@ rix consists of two vaccines , whereby the first dose is administ@@ ered at the date of election and the second dose between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a re@@ flex is desired for hep@@ atitis A as well as hep@@ atitis B , the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ tic vaccines can be vacc@@ inated with the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ enten vaccines or with a combined form of combination .
the anti @-@ hep@@ atitis against a vacc@@ ination sim@@ ulated anti @-@ hep@@ atitis viruses ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) - and anti @-@ hep@@ atitis A @-@ virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) -@@ anti@@ body values are in the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ enten vaccines .
it is still not completely safegu@@ ar@@ ded whether the immun@@ o @-@ competent persons who have addressed on a hep@@ atitis A@@ - vacc@@ ination , as they are also being protected with non @-@ em@@ ission antibodies because of immun@@ ological memory .
3 How in all inj@@ ections should be available for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ l@@ actic reaction after the gift of the vaccine such as medical treatment and monitoring is always available immediately .
if a quick protection against hep@@ atitis B is required , the standardization scheme is recommended with the combined sim@@ ulated hep@@ atitis A @-@ A @-@ virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ able hep@@ atitis B surface .
in hem@@ at@@ aly@@ tic sep@@ tic and persons with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the immune system , after vacc@@ ination , no bo@@ unds anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and Anti @-@ H@@ BS anti@@ bodies can be achieved so in these cases the gift of further vaccines can be required .
as a intr@@ ad@@ er@@ male inj@@ ecting or in@@ tra @-@ mus@@ cular administration can lead to a sub@@ optimal vaccine to be avoided should these inj@@ ections should be avoided .
at Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oc@@ top@@ en@@ ie or blo@@ od@@ onal disorders , Ambi@@ rix cannot be inj@@ ected to inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous since it can occur in these cases to in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular gifts .
when ambi@@ rix in second life year in the form of a separate injection , tet@@ ell@@ ular per@@ om@@ yel@@ i@@ tis@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza type b @-@ vaccine ( D@@ T@@ Pa @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or using a combined mask is sufficient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in patients suffering from immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immun@@ def@@ ective need to be taken that perhaps no adequate immune response is obtained .
in a clinical study conducted with 3 vacc@@ ination of this wording in adults , the frequency of pain , red@@ ness , sw@@ elling , gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ tis , head@@ aches and fe@@ ver comparable to the frequency that was observed at the earlier thi@@ om@@ ers@@ al@@ - and preser@@ vatives .
in clinical trials 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ination ambi@@ tions have been administ@@ ered at a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ inations at the age of 1 and including 15 years .
in a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 and including 15 years , the compatibility of ambi@@ rix not compared with the 3 @-@ dos@@ ed combination of combination .
only exceptions were the higher frequency of pain and mat@@ s on a calculation basis per vacc@@ d@@ osis Ambi@@ rix , but not on a calculation basis for each person .
pain was observed after the gift of ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 0.7 % of the Pro@@ ban@@ den , compared to 39.@@ 1 % with the commission after the gift of a dose of 3 @-@ doses of combination .
after the complete vaccine cycle , 6@@ 6.4 % of the Pro@@ ban@@ den , received the ambi@@ tions agreed , more than pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % at the Pro@@ ban@@ den , which had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ level of combination .
however , the frequency of mat@@ s was compared high ( that is , above the entire vaccine cycle at 39,@@ 6 % of the Pro@@ ban@@ den , the ambi@@ rix didn &apos;t compared with 36.@@ 2 % in the prob@@ ands that received the 3 @-@ doses of combination .
the frequency of pronoun@@ ced sor@@ eness and mat@@ s was low and comparable to those who have observed after administration of the combined form with the 3 @-@ doses of the vaccine .
in a compar@@ ative study for 1 @-@ year @-@ year vacc@@ ination , the appearance of local actions and general actions in the ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ group was comparable to that which is associated with the 3 @-@ doses of combined hep@@ atitis C @-@ A @-@ virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ able hep@@ atitis B @-@ B surface .
from the 6@@ - to 11@@ - year @-@ old , however , after vacc@@ ination with ambi@@ rix a frequent appearance of pain ( at the inj@@ ecting location ) per dose , not per pro@@ band .

the Fuel rates for Anti @-@ H@@ BS were 7@@ 4,@@ 2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to month 6 dose ( i.e. , in month 7 ) .
7 In a compar@@ ative study , which was performed at 12@@ - until including 15 @-@ year @-@ old , 142 two doses ambi@@ tions and 147 the standard line @-@ combination with three cans .
for the 289 persons whose imm@@ uni@@ ity was valuable , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ate rates ( SP in the table below ) against hep@@ atitis B in the month 2 and 6 after gift of the 3 @-@ dosage range significantly higher than with ambi@@ rix .
the immune answers that have been reached in a clinical compar@@ ative study for 1 @-@ year @-@ year a month after ending the full vaccine ( that is , in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies the vacc@@ ination had either a 2 @-@ dos@@ ed vaccine with ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ dos@@ ed vaccine with a combined sim@@ ulated hep@@ atitis A @-@ virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ able hep@@ atitis B @-@ B surface .
people who were sentenced at the time of the Grun@@ di@@ mm@@ v@@ zation between 12 and 15 years ago , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and Anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies to be proven for at least 24 months following the imm@@ uni@@ zation with ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 @-@ month vaccine .
the immune reaction against both anti@@ gens was comparable to the sim@@ pl@@ ation of 3 cans with a combined sim@@ ulator with a combination sim@@ ulated hep@@ atitis B surface and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ able hep@@ atitis B oc@@ op@@ an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical trial at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ old could be shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and Anti @-@ H@@ BS anti @-@ antibodies after 24 months is comparable to immun@@ isation in the 0 @-@ 6@@ - @-@ month vaccine is comparable to that in the 0 @-@ 12 @-@ month vaccine .

the hep@@ atitis A @-@ virus is usually transmitted by vir@@ al fruits foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other ways such as by bathing in waters negl@@ ected waters .
you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a p@@ ale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( lover ) and other symptoms which may possibly make a stationary treatment necessary .
as with all vaccines , Ambi@@ rix not fully protect against an infection with hep@@ atitis or hep@@ atitis B virus , even if the full vaccine has been completed with 2 cans .
if you / your child are infected before the administration of both vaccines or hep@@ atitis B virus ( although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or ill / feel ) a vacc@@ ination may not prevent a vacc@@ ination .
a protection against other infections that are causing the liver or symptoms that are similar to those after a hep@@ atitis or hep@@ atitis B infection can not be convey@@ ed .
• If you already have an allergic reaction to ambi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine including Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibi@@ otic ) .
an allergic reaction can express itself due to ju@@ ck@@ ende rash , respir@@ atory or ana@@ esthe@@ tic of the face or the tongue . • If you have performed an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hep@@ atitis A or hep@@ atitis B . • If you / your child have a severe infection with fe@@ ver .
• If you want to quickly have a protection against Hepatitis B ( that is , within 6 months and prior to the usually proposed administration of the second V@@ osis ) .
for a possible risk of infection with hep@@ atitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination the doctor will tell you / your child from a vaccine with ambi@@ tions .
instead , it will recommend you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hep@@ atitis B vaccine with a reduced sal@@ ute ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hep@@ atitis A @-@ virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis B @-@ hardness ) .
the second vacc@@ ination of this vaccine with reduced sal@@ ary to effective components usually cul@@ min@@ ated one month after the first dose and may l@@ end your child a vacc@@ ination prior to termination of the vaccine .
sometimes ambi@@ tions will suffer from people who are suffering from severe blood cells , under the skin and not in the muscle cr@@ ashes . • if you / your child are weak@@ ened due to a disease or treatment in your / her body &apos;s body , or if you / your child shall under@@ go a ha@@ w@@ aly@@ sis .
ambi@@ tions can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these people on the vacc@@ ination can not be sufficient , so be a blood test may be necessary to see how strongly the reaction to the vacc@@ ination is .
21 S@@ ail your doctor , if you / your child may take additional medicines ( including those who have been received without prescription ) or if you / your child have recently been vacc@@ inated / or have been planned or immun@@ og@@ lo@@ bul@@ ins ( antibodies ) , or it has been planned in the near future .
but it can be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is not protected against one or both hep@@ atitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine must be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , should be vacc@@ inated in separate positions and as many as possible limb@@ s .
when ambi@@ rix starts at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lo@@ bul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient .
usually , Ambi@@ rix pregnant or nurs@@ ing women not administ@@ ered unless it is urgently needed that it can be vacc@@ inated both against hep@@ atitis A and hep@@ atitis B .
important information about certain other components of ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( antibi@@ otic ) .
if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vaccine , speak to your doctor and arrange an appointment as soon as possible .

based on data base , which has become known since re@@ distribution of the first approval for the controller , the CH@@ MP believes that the benefits @-@ risk relationship for ambi@@ rix remains positive .
since Ambi@@ rix not only has been launched in one Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available security data for this medicine is limited due to the low patient position .
Am@@ mon@@ aps can also be used in patients aged over a month with an entire En@@ z@@ ym@@ pic or with hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ic encephal@@ opathy ( encephal@@ opathy ) in pre@@ history .
Am@@ mon@@ aps is possible - split by several single p@@ ants to the meals - s@@ wal@@ low@@ ed under the food or via a gast@@ ro@@ ar dent@@ ures ( through the stomach in the stomach of leading hose ) or a n@@ as@@ and@@ onde ( through the nose in the stomach of leading hose ) .
it was not a compar@@ ative study since Am@@ mon@@ aps was not compared to another treatment or with plac@@ ebo ( a hypo@@ medi@@ al ament , i.e. , without drug ) .
Am@@ mon@@ aps can also lead to appeti@@ zing , an ab@@ normal calcium content in blood , depression , irrit@@ ation , trou@@ blesho@@ oting , cre@@ ases , hydr@@ ation , anti @-@ pain , v@@ om@@ iting , in@@ sti@@ pation , rash , in@@ sti@@ pation , un@@ pleas@@ ing body or weight gain .
the Committee on Human@@ phar@@ yn@@ x ( CH@@ MP ) en@@ acted to the conclusion that am@@ mon@@ aps in patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary cycle to high am@@ moni@@ ous levels are effectively prevented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps was approved in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as due to the rar@@ ity of the disease at the time of approval only limited information on this medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use is inde@@ xed with all patients , in which a complete hi@@ ding organ has already manif@@ ested in the new@@ born age ( within the first 28 Leb@@ enst@@ age ) .
in patients with a bel@@ ated form ( in@@ adequate En@@ z@@ ym@@ pic ) , who manif@@ ests itself after the first life of life ) there is an indication for the use when in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese is a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ic encephal@@ opathy .
for inf@@ ants , for children who are not able to s@@ wal@@ low tablets or for patients with lo@@ oting is AM@@ AR@@ PS also available in gran@@ ular form .
the daily dosage is calculated individually considering the toler@@ ance and development of the daily prot@@ ections of the patient .
the previous clinical experience is the normal daily dose of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight of 20 kg as well as in growing and adults .
in patients who suffer from a timely lack of car@@ bam@@ yl phosph@@ ate@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ ty bam@@ yl@@ ase , the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ rul@@ line or Ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3,8 g / m ² / day required .
patients with a Ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase lack must be Ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0,4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8,@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ AR@@ PS tablets are not administ@@ ered in patients with excav@@ ation , as a risk for the origin of Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ ls , if the tablets are not immediately going into the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MONA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium poly@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ AR@@ PS should therefore be used in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or serious kid@@ ney @-@ heart failure as well as with sodium @-@ tention and eco @-@ formation of clinical conditions , only with caution .
since met@@ abo@@ lic and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium lam@@ but@@ yr@@ ate over the liver and the kid@@ neys , AM@@ AR@@ PS should be used in patients with liver or kid@@ ney failure only with extreme caution .
the significance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ AR@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contrac@@ ted ( see 4.3 ) .
at sub@@ cut@@ aneous scale of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats ( 190 - 474 mg / kg ) it came to a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal multip@@ lic@@ ation and to an increased loss of neur@@ ons .
there also found a consuming mat@@ ur@@ ation of cer@@ eb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a dimin@@ ished number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and therefore a disability of brain growth .
it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is in@@ dem@@ oted in humans in the mother &apos;s milk , and for this reason is the use of AM@@ AR@@ PS during the bre@@ ast@@ feeding period ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trial with AM@@ AR@@ PS , at 56 % of patients came at least an undes@@ irable event ( AE ) at 56 % of these undes@@ irable events , that they did not connect with AM@@ AR@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1.000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able tox@@ ic reaction at AM@@ AR@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 year old an@@ ore@@ tical patient , which developed a met@@ abo@@ lic encephal@@ opathy in conjunction with Lak@@ tat@@ azi@@ dis , peri@@ ph@@ er@@ ers , peri@@ ph@@ er@@ ie and pan@@ cre@@ atitis .
a case of over@@ dose stood for a 5 month old small@@ holding with a different individual dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate which showed a dose of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day a dos@@ is@@ limit neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a met@@ abo@@ lic active connection that is con@@ genital by acet@@ yl@@ ates with gl@@ ut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine , which is exposed over the kid@@ neys .
Sti@@ chi@@ omet@@ ric identi@@ fies phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine with urea ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ rogen at@@ oms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carriers for the ex@@ cre@@ tion of surplus @-@ reduced nit@@ rogen .
5 patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary cycle can be accepted that for each gram it is produced sodium @-@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate between 0,@@ 12 and 0.15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine @-@ nit@@ rogen .
it is of importance that the diagnosis is completed at an early stage and the treatment is started to improve the survival chances and clinical results .
the progn@@ osis of the early mani@@ fol@@ ds form of the disease with appearance of the first symptoms in the new@@ born age was almost always inf@@ ist , and the disease led even in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al@@ di@@ aly@@ sis or ob@@ ese amino acids or with their sti@@ cally @-@ free an@@ alogy within the first lifetime of death .
through hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative ways of nit@@ rogen hormone and sodium poly@@ phen@@ acet@@ ate ) , prot@@ ru@@ sted C@@ ost and possibly sub@@ stitution of ess@@ enti@@ als amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ born in post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first life @-@ month ) of diagnos@@ ti@@ led diseases on 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and the survival rate were treated 100 % , but even with these patients there was time with many to spiritual disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its .
in patients with a bel@@ ated form of the disease ( including female patients with het@@ ero@@ zy@@ g@@ ous form of or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ ty bam@@ bin@@ i recovered and afterwards permanently with sodium yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate and a prot@@ ru@@ di@@ ous diet were treated , was the survival rate 98 % .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are also hardly re@@ versi@@ bly and in treating some patients may occur further deteri@@ oration of neuro@@ logical condition .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is ox@@ idi@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ dens@@ ed in liver and kid@@ ney enzym@@ atic with gl@@ ut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine .
the concentr@@ ations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its met@@ abo@@ lic acid at plasma and Ur@@ in were determined according to G@@ abe of a single dose of 5 g sodium @-@ but@@ to@@ but@@ yr@@ ate in so@@ ber @-@ cycle and with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis for single hand@@ over as well as re@@ peti@@ tive gifts from up to 20 g / day ( non @-@ controlled studies ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate and its met@@ abo@@ lic disorders also were also examined in cancer patients by sodium and phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after a oral sub@@ dose of 5 g sodium and phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate in tablet form , 15 minutes after taking meas@@ urable plasma @-@ centr@@ ations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate .
in the majority of patients with ur@@ ic cycles or hem@@ og@@ lo@@ op@@ ia , according to various doses of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) in the next morning after night @-@ time fast@@ ing is not a phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate at Plas@@ ma .
with three of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , which were repeated with sodium yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single p@@ ants ) , the middle phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentration on the third day five times higher than after the first gifts .
Ex@@ traction The medication is used within 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100 % in the form of con@@ ju@@ gi@@ fted product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine over the kid@@ neys .
according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests had sodium @-@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at with tox@@ ic and non @-@ tox@@ ic doses treat@@ able effects ( investigation 24 and 48 h according to or@@ aler administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ AR@@ PS Gran@@ ules will be taken either oral ( inf@@ ants and children who are not able to s@@ wal@@ low , or patients with lo@@ af disorders ) or via a gast@@ ro@@ dent@@ ures , or a n@@ os@@ onde .
the previous clinical experience is the normal daily dose of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with new@@ born , inf@@ ants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight of 20 kg as well as in growing and adults .
the concentration of ammonia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , ess@@ enti@@ als amino acids ( especially per@@ v@@ ast@@ ous amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um proteins in plasma should be kept within the normal range .
in patients who suffer from a timely lack of car@@ bam@@ yl phosph@@ ate@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ ty bam@@ yl@@ ase , the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ rul@@ line or Ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3,8 g / m ² / day required .
AM@@ AR@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5.@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram sodium poly@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium poly@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when R@@ atten@@ f@@ utes prior to the birth phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active met@@ abo@@ lic of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ) were exposed , it came to l@@ esi@@ ons in the pyr@@ ami@@ des of the brain .
a prob@@ able tox@@ ic reaction at AM@@ AR@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 year old an@@ ore@@ tical patient , which developed a met@@ abo@@ lic encephal@@ opathy in conjunction with Lak@@ tat@@ azi@@ dis , peri@@ ph@@ er@@ ers , peri@@ ph@@ er@@ ie and pan@@ cre@@ atitis .
Stö@@ chi@@ omet@@ ric identi@@ fies phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine with urea ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ rogen at@@ oms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carriers for the ex@@ cre@@ tion of surplus @-@ wire
on the basis of investigations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary cycle can be assumed that for each gram , it is produced from 0,@@ 12 and 0.15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine @-@ nit@@ rogen .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are also not reversible for treatment and some patients may occur further deteri@@ oration of neuro@@ logical condition .
after a oral sub@@ dose of 5 g sodium and phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate in gran@@ ulate @-@ form , 15 minutes after taking meas@@ urable plasma @-@ centr@@ ations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate .
during the duration of durability the patient can store the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of over 25 ° C .
this procedure includes the small measuring spo@@ on clause , the mean measuring spo@@ on 2.9 g and the large measuring spo@@ on 8,@@ 6 g sodium poly@@ but@@ yr@@ ate .
if a patient has to get the medication via a Son@@ de , AM@@ AR@@ PS can also be dis@@ solved in water ( the solu@@ bility of sodium poly@@ but@@ yr@@ ate amounts to 5 g in 10 ml water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enz@@ y@@ me , so they can accumul@@ ate the thick@@ en@@ ic waste products which can accumul@@ ate after consumption of proteins in the body , not divor@@ ce .
if at your laboratory check , you must notify the doctor that you may have AM@@ AR@@ PS , since sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate can influence the results of certain laboratories .
when taking AM@@ AR@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or chem@@ ist when you take other medicines or recently taken , even if it is not prescription @-@ only drugs .
during the bre@@ ast@@ feeding time , you may not take AM@@ AR@@ PS because the medicine could move into the mother &apos;s milk and harm your baby .

An@@ gi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with &quot; ak@@ uten cor@@ k &quot; ( ACS , decreased blood zu@@ res to the heart ) , for instance at inst@@ abil@@ er Ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ din@@ ary ( heart attack ) without &quot; ST@@ - Heb@@ er &quot; ( a decent measuring rate at electro@@ cardi@@ ogra@@ m or EC@@ G ) .
if An@@ gi@@ ox to prevent blo@@ od@@ stream in patients used to under@@ go a PCI , a higher dose is administ@@ ered and the inf@@ usion can proceed up to four hours after the procedure .
this can contribute to patients with Ang@@ ina or heart attack on the maintenance of blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
approximate 14 000 patients took part in the main study on the treatment of ACS @-@ II@@ I@@ a @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( G@@ PI , a different medicine to prevent blood cells ) with the conventional combination treatment with her@@ et@@ ine ( another anti @-@ oxid@@ ant ) and a G@@ PI .
during the PCI was often a st@@ ent ( a short tubes that remains in the arter@@ ies to prevent a cl@@ asp ) , and they also got other medicines for preventing blood cells , such as ab@@ ci@@ ent and aspir@@ in .
for the treatment of ACS , An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without gift of G@@ PI - in the prevention of new events ( deaths , heart accidents or rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ari@@ zation ) after 30 days or one year , just as effective as traditional treatment .
in patients who under@@ went up a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox in relation to all indicators is just as effective as ho@@ et@@ ine , except in severe ble@@ eding in which it was significantly more effective than H@@ epar@@ in .
An@@ gi@@ ox may not be used in patients who may possibly pers@@ ensi@@ tive ( allergic ) against bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine , other brain or one of the other ingredients .
it may not also be used in patients suffering , which recently had a ble@@ eding , as well as humans with heavy high blood pressure or severe kid@@ ney problems or a heart attack .
the Committee on Human@@ phar@@ yn@@ x ( CH@@ MP ) finished to the conclusion that An@@ gi@@ ox in the treatment of ACS and during a PCI a ann@@ ot@@ able replacement for H@@ epar@@ in is .
September 2004 , the European Commission shared by The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd appro@@ ving a permit for the transfer of angi@@ ot@@ ox in the whole of the European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with ac@@ ute Kor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes ( inst@@ ab@@ ile Ang@@ ina / non - ST @-@ Heb@@ ungs@@ inf@@ arkt ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in an emergency handle or when an early intervention is planned .
the recommended initi@@ al@@ dose of angi@@ o@@ ox in patients with ACS is a intra@@ ven@@ ous Bol@@ us@@ ement of 0,1 mg / kg followed by an inf@@ usion of 0,25 mg / kg / h .
if a PCI is conducted in further succ@@ ession , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be increased and inf@@ usion is increased to the duration of the surgery on 1.75 mg / kg / h .
after the PCI can return to clinical requirements again the reduced inf@@ usion dose of 0,25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours .
immediately prior to the procedure a bol@@ ting of 0,5 mg / kg will be administ@@ ered , followed by an inf@@ usion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the Rhin@@ op@@ last@@ y .
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ot@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of a initi@@ ating intra@@ ven@@ ous weight of 0.75 mg / kg of body weight and one of them directly subsequent intra@@ ven@@ ous inf@@ usion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg of body weight / h at least for the duration of the operation .
the safety and eff@@ ic@@ acy of a all@@ evi@@ ate Bol@@ us by An@@ gi@@ ox was not tested and is not recommended , even though a short PCI procedure is planned .
this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is short@@ ened to under 225 seconds , should be a second m@@ enc@@ ore of 0,3 mg / kg / body weight .
in order to decrease the appearance of low ACT values , the constitutional and dil@@ uted medicines should be carefully mixed and the Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis should be observed rapidly .
once the ACT is worth more than 225 seconds , a further monitoring is no longer required , provided that 1.75 mg / kg inf@@ usion can be administ@@ ered properly .
in patients with moderate kid@@ ney @-@ functioning ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are treated with PCI ( whether treated with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine against ACS or not ) , should be employed a lower inf@@ usion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h .
lies the ACT value below 225 seconds , is a second Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis of 0,3 mg / kg to be administ@@ ered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis once again .
in patients with mid @-@ severe kid@@ neys who introduced to the approval of II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PL@@ ACE @-@ 2 ) , which were included in the Phase 5 minutes by gift of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Bol@@ us without dosage adjustment on average 366 ± 89 seconds .
3 In case of patients with severe kid@@ ney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis @-@ patient patients is an@@ to@@ x @-@ indi@@ ces ( see below section 4.3 ) .
the treatment with angi@@ ot@@ ox can be re@@ directed 30 minutes after ending the intra@@ ven@@ ous weigh@@ ting h@@ epar@@ ks or 8 hours after the end of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous streams of the molecular H@@ epar@@ in .

patients are carefully monitored during the treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of ble@@ eding , especially when bid@@ val@@ s@@ ud@@ ine is administ@@ ered in combination with another anti @-@ anti@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ( see Section 4.5 ) .
even if PCI @-@ patients can occur at bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in most blo@@ od@@ ations on arter@@ ial dots , can occur in patients suffering from a per@@ k@@ ut@@ aneous coron@@ ary ar@@ mies ( PCI ) while treating in principle everywhere ble@@ eding .
in patients who are taking War@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , should be considered a monitoring of IN@@ R @-@ Wer@@ ts ( International Stand@@ Mal@@ ised Ratio ) to ensure that the value is achieved after abor@@ tion of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine again the prior to treatment .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolesc@@ ents and children from six years with diabetes that need treatment with ins@@ ulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the stomach wall , the upper th@@ igh or the upper arm inj@@ ected or as permanent inf@@ usion with an ins@@ ulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough ins@@ ulin for the regul@@ ator of the Glu@@ cos@@ ity ( sugar ) produced in the blood or that ins@@ ulin can not apply effectively .
in@@ sist@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in diff@@ ers very slightly from Human@@ ins@@ ulin , and the changes means that it works faster and a shorter ear @-@ term is more effective than a short @-@ effective human ins@@ ulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra was used in its application in combination with a long @-@ effective ins@@ ulin in patients with type @-@ 1 diabetes that can produce no ins@@ ulin , in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study involving 5@@ 72 children aged between 4 and 17 years .
in case of type 2 diabetes , in which the body ins@@ ulin can not be effective , A@@ pi@@ dra was examined in a study involving 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indi@@ k@@ ator for the eff@@ ic@@ acy was the change of concentration of substance gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ zed hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
in the first study with adults with type @-@ 1 diabetes , after six months , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a lower@@ ing of 0.@@ 14 % at In@@ sul@@ in@@ lis@@ pro .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , the reduction of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c level is equivalent to the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c @-@ concentration after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0,30 % with human@@ ic normal ins@@ ulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra must not be used in patients who may possibly have hy@@ pers@@ ensi@@ tive ( allergic ) against in@@ sul@@ ul@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in or any of the other ingredients , or in patients suffering from a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra must possibly be customized if it is administ@@ ered along with a number of other medicines that can impact on the blood @-@ glu@@ cos@@ ity level .
September 2004 , the European Commission shared the company San@@ o@@ fi @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH has been a permit for the integration of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is considered substantial as sub@@ cut@@ aneous inj@@ ecting either in the field of pan@@ l@@ oth , of the wa@@ iter , or of the del@@ to@@ x or sub@@ cut@@ aneous through continuous flow inf@@ usion into the area of pan@@ cre@@ ws .
due to the reduced Glu@@ con@@ e@@ ogen@@ esis @-@ capacity and the dimin@@ ished inverter , the In@@ sul@@ in@@ requires in patients with a limitation of the liver function .
any change of the work force , the brand ( flo@@ ating ) , the In@@ sul@@ int@@ yp@@ s ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc @-@ del@@ ayed , etc . ) , the type of ins@@ ulin ( animal ins@@ ulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can draw a change in the in@@ appropriate order .
3 A in@@ sufficient dosage or ab@@ out@@ break of a treatment , especially in patients with an ins@@ ulin @-@ tax diabetes , can lead to a hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and a di@@ abe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ azi@@ erg@@ osis ; these states are potentially vital to life threat@@ ening .
the change@@ over of a patient to another in@@ sist@@ or or ins@@ ulin of another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and can make a change of dosage .
the timing of a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the ingre@@ dient of the used In@@ sul@@ ine and can therefore change during the change of the treatment scheme .
among the substances that increase blood circulation and increase incl@@ ination to hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic substances , or@@ op@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ Conver@@ ting @-@ enzym@@ m ( ACE ) -@@ Hem@@ mer , Flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , Fo@@ ox@@ et@@ yl@@ lin , Pro@@ po@@ xy@@ phen , S@@ aliz@@ yl@@ ates and Sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics .
in addition , under the effect of sympath@@ e@@ dic@@ s such as Bet@@ ab@@ lock@@ ers , Cl@@ oni@@ din , Gu@@ an@@ eth@@ id@@ in and Reser@@ pin the symptoms of the ad@@ ren@@ ergen counter@@ party .
animal experim@@ entation studies for the reproductive @-@ rep@@ air@@ ment showed no differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ in and Human@@ ins@@ ulin in relation to pregnancy , the embry@@ onic development , the birth or the post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether In@@ sul@@ an@@ l@@ ul@@ ence enters into the human mother &apos;s milk , but in general ins@@ ulin occurs neither in the mother &apos;s milk , nor is it res@@ orted to or@@ ally application .

according to a gl@@ uc@@ in@@ ist , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the Ur@@ - cause of the severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and avoid similar episodes .
ins@@ ulin lowers the blood sugar levels by the stimulation of the peri@@ ph@@ eral gl@@ uc@@ ose ( especially through sk@@ elet@@ al muscles and fat ) , as well as by the im@@ itation of glu@@ cos@@ ine production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at sub@@ k@@ ut@@ ans Ga@@ - be done faster and the active duration is shorter than at hu@@ - man@@ em Nor@@ mal@@ ins@@ ulin .

in addition , in@@ sist@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has an twice as fast way as normal Human@@ ins@@ ulin and sco@@ red the full glu@@ cos@@ al effect about 2 hours earlier than Human@@ ins@@ ulin .
the data was clearly visible that in an application of in@@ sul@@ ul@@ ul@@ si@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal is reached a comparable post@@ p@@ ran@@ ial gly@@ cem@@ ic control as is given in a human@@ ic normal ins@@ ulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
