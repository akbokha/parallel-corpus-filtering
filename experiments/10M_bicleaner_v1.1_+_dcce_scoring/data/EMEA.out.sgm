<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public License Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Humanpharynx (CHMP) has been assessed to recommendations regarding the application of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need more information about your disease or treatment, please read the package inserts (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">For more information regarding the recommendations of CHMP, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, than 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg melting (tablets that can arise in the mouth) as solution to the insertion (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. Turres thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or sight of things that are not available), distrust and inscription; • bipolar-I disorder, a psychic disorder, in which patients have manic episodes (periods) alternately with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used for the treatment of severe to severe manic episodes and for the prevention of manic episodes in patients who have addressed the drug in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">Injecting solution is applied to the rapid control of increased unrest or behavioural disorders, if the oral intake of the medication is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both diseases can take the solution for taking or put the melting tabletches in patients where the swallowing of tablets are prepared.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who are taking other medicines at the same time as Abilify, the dose of Abilify should be customized.</seg>
<seg id="10">This affects the signal transmission between brain cells by means of neurotransmitters, i.e. chemical substances that allow communication between nerve cells to each other.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripibilzol presumably works mainly as a partial agonist "for the receptors for the neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also serotonin called).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means Aripibilzol like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but in a low degree as the neurotransmitters works to enable the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Da Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin near schizophrenia and bipolar disorder has a role played, Aripibilzol to normalize the activity of the brain, causing psychotic or manic symptoms and to prevent their reacting.</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of anbilify that reoccur in the symptoms of symptoms, was examined in three studies over up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of injecting solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases, which compared to increased unrest, over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In a further study, Abilify about twelve weeks in 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the effectiveness of Abilify and placebo that reoccur to 160 patients with which the manic symptoms were already stabilized with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The effectiveness of Abilify injecting solution has been in a study on 301 patients with bipolar disorder, who suffered in stagnant unrest, with which by Lorazepam (an other antipsychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies the change in symptoms of patients were examined using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients infected with the treatment, examined.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also led studies to examine how the body gets the melting-coated tablets and the solution for taking (up).</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies with injecting solution showed patients who received Abilify in doses of 5,25 mg, 9,75 mg or 15 mg, a significant increased reduction in symptoms increased stress than the patients who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the application for the treatment of bipolar disorder reduced Abilify in four of the five short-term studies more effective than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also used up to 74 weeks in more effective than placebo and replacental episodes in previously treated patients and when it comes in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Anbilify injections in 10- or 15-mg-doses reduced more effective than placebo the symptoms increased undisturbed and were similar effectively as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify for taking (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disorders (continuous), somnolence (inflection), vocals, nausea (elevated memory), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnever (sleep disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee on Humanpharynx (CHMP) finished to the conclusion that the advantages of Abilify for treating schizophrenia and in the prevention of a new manic episode in patients, the predominantly manic episodes and in which the manic episodes of the treatment with Aripibilzol spoke to outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the committee came to the outcome that the benefits of injecting solution for rapid control of increased unrest and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder, if a oral therapy is not suitable to outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">June 2004, the European Commission shared the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a permit for the transportation of ibilify in the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is a disorder in the treatment of excessive to severe manic episodes of bipolar-I- disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients indicated, the predominantly manic episodes and their manic episodes in the treatment with Aripibilisi (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY amounts 10 or 15 mg / day at a refreshment dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">A stacked effectiveness in dosages above a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY amounts to 15 mg once daily, irrespective of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar-I- disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">With regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group should be considered a lower Initial dosage, if clinical factors do this justify (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 inductor is set out of the combination therapy, the Aripibilzol dose to be reduced to the recommended dose (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The appearance of successive behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders, and has been reported in some cases after the start or change of an antipsychotic therapy, also in treatment with Aripibilzol (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of a epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder is no increased admissions risk with Aripibilzol compared to other antipsychotka.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripibilzol should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases, cerebrovasculosis, hypothesis, hypovolous drugs, hypovolous medicines) or hypertension (including akzelerious and maligne form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Spätdyskinesia: in clinical trials, which was a year or less digestible, there were occasional reports on during the treatment with Aripianzol-tretende dyskinesie.</seg>
<seg id="39">If at one with ABILIFY patients treated signs and symptoms of a Spätdyskinesie patients should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient has developed signs and symptoms which impose on a mns, or unclean high fever without any additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotka must be abducted, including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore Aripibilzol should be used in patients with clamping cases in the anamnese or at random, which are being used with crampons.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripibilzol in patients with psychosis who are associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripibilzol, a higher sterilization compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">There were however in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between dosage and the speaking for unwanted cerebrovasculary events upon with Aripibilzol patients.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hypermetcemia, in some cases extremely and associated with Ketoaziergosis or hyperosmolarem Coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="45">There is no precise risk assessment for Hyperglycaemia-related unwanted events with ABILIFY and other atypical antipsychotic agents to be treated with direct transmissions.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsie, Polyurie, Polyphagie and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be regularly monitored with regard to a deterioration of the glucose values.</seg>
<seg id="47">A weight gain is generally applied in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar Manie, due to Komorbidding, the use of antipsychotica in which weight gain is known as side-effect and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripibilzol on the central nervous system, if Aripibilzol is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective medicines such as Sedierung (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The h2 antagonist Famotidine, a Magensäure of blocker, reduces the Resorption rate of Aripibilzol, whereby this effect is however not relevant to be clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy volunteers, a high-effective CYP2D6-Inhibitor (Chinidine) the AUC of Aripibilzol around 107%, while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly-effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, similar effects have and therefore should be made similar dosed reduction.</seg>
<seg id="52">At CYP2D6 'bad' (= 'poor ") metabolic fishers can result the common application with high-effective Inhibitors from CYP3A4 in higher plasma chambers from Aripibilzol compared to CYP2D6 extendiven metabolic.</seg>
<seg id="53">If one should consider the common gift from Ketoconazol or other high-effective CYP3A4 Inhibitors with ABILIFY, the potential benefits should predominate potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly-effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, like Itraconazol and HIV protocols, are likely to have similar effects and therefore should be made similar cumulative issues.</seg>
<seg id="55">After dismissing the CYP2D6- or 3A4-Inhibitors the dosage of ABILIFY should be raised to the dosage height before the beginning of the companion therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with ABILIFY administered, can be calculated with a moderate increase in Aripibilzol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical studies showed doses of 10-30 mg Aripianzol a day not significant effect on metabolic disorders of the substrates of CYP2D6 (Dextromethorphan / 3-methods-morphology) and 3A4 (Dextromethorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">The patient should be coming to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during the treatment with Aripibilzol.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to the insufficient data situation for the safety of people and due to the reproduction studies for animal studies, this medicine may not be applied in pregnancy, unless the potential benefits justifies clearly the potential risk for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">As well as in other antipsychotka, patients should be forewarned, dangerous machines, including fuel-cars, to serve until they are certain that Aripibilzol has no negative influence on it.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects occurred more frequently (≥ 1 / 100) to than under placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of the rates listed below is defined according to the following criteria: often (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1.000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study over 52 weeks entered in patients who were treated with Aripiual (25.8%) of EPS including Parkinson-ism, Akathisie, Dystonie and Dyskinesie, compared to patients infected with Haloperidol (57.6%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study over 26 weeks was the incidence of EPS 19% in patients with Aripibilzol treatment and 13.1% in patients among placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study over 26 weeks was the incidence of EPS 14.8% in patients who were treated with Aripianzol and 15.1% in patients under Olanzapin therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes with bipolar-I disorder - In a controlled trial over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 23.5% was among patients suffering from Aripibilzol- treatment and 53,3% in patients under Haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In a different study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26,6% in patients decreased by Aripibilzol treatment and 17,6% for those under lithium-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-time period of 26 weeks when a placebo-controlled trial was the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients suffering from Aripibilzol- treatment and 15.7% for patients with placebo patients.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripibilzol and placebo, in which potentially clinically significant changes in routinely controlled laboratory parameters occurred, taken no medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases the CPK (creatine phosphokinase), generally temporarily and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of the patients treated with Aripianzol treated patients compared to 2,0% of the patients to be treated with placebo patients.</seg>
<seg id="71">To the side effects that may occur in connection with an antipsychotic treatment, and on their appearance even in the treatment with Aripibilzol, the Maligne neuroleptic syndrome, spatirovasculary events and increased mortality in older dementia, hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical studies and since the market introduction were unintentional or visible acute overdosing with Aripibilzol alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and with no deaths.</seg>
<seg id="73">While there are no information about the efficacy of an hematalysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripibilisi; it is unlikely, however, that hematalysis is a high plasma cutting accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is suspected that the effectiveness of Aripibilzol in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disorder regarding the combination of a participantagonistic effect on Dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and an antagonistic impact on serotonin 5HT2a receptors will be conveyed.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripibilzol showed a high affinity to the Dopamine D2- and D3 receptors and a moderate affinity to the Dopamine D4-, to the Serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, to alpha-1-adrenergen and for histamine-H1receptors.</seg>
<seg id="76">At the gift of Aripibilzol in doses of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily on 2 weeks to healthy volunteers, the Positrons-Emissions-tomarprid, a D2 / D3 receptors, at Nucleus caudatus and at Putamen.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-time studies (4 to 6 weeks) at 1,228 schizophrenen patients with positive or negative symptom showed Aripibilisi compared to placebo a statistically significant improvement of the psychological symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a Haloperidol-controlled trial was a week 52 of the percentage of the members of patients who held an approach to the study medication, in both groups similarly (Aripibilzol 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from Messages, which were defined as secondary studies, including PANSS and the Montgomery Asberg- depressionaries scale, showed a significant stronger improvement than at Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled trial over 26 weeks on stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia showed an significantly higher reduction of the return rate, which was at 34% in the Aripibilzol group and at 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olanzapper-controlled, multinational double blind study on schizophrenia on 26 weeks, the 314 patients were controversial and in which the primary study enziel 'weighted' was referred to under Aripibili (N = 18 or 13% of the valuable patients) in significant patient (i.e. a increase of at least 5,6 kg at an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled Monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar-I-disorder illustrate Aripibilzol a compared to placebo legend effectiveness in reducing lack of physical symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dosage of bipolar-I error showed Aripibilisi towards placebo no excessive effect.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo- and active-controlled Monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, showed Aripibilisi, compared to placebo leggy effectiveness in week 3 and a accounting effect that was comparable to that of Lithium or Haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">Aripibilzol also pointed out to 12 a comparable portion of patients with symptomatic remission of the Manie on how Lithium or Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled trial over 6 weeks with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychological characteristics which are partly over 2 weeks not to Lithium- or Valproat-monotherapy in therapeutic symptoms, compared to monotherapy with lithium or Valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a long-time expansion phase over 74 weeks in manic patients, who had achieved a remission during a stabilisation phase before Randomize compared to placebo with regard to the prevention of a bipolar refund, predominantly in prevention of a relapse into the Manie.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro-studies are the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 for the Dehydrift and hydroxytyres of Aripibilzol, the N-Dealkyrie is catalyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The average Elimination period is approximate 75 hours for Aripibilzol in extensively metabolic actors over CYP2D6 and at approximate 146 hours with 'bad' (= 'poor') metabolic visers above CYTHD6.</seg>
<seg id="90">At Aripibilzol there are no differences in pharmacogeninetics between male and female healthy volunteers, so they showed no gender-dependent effects in a pharmacokinetic examination.</seg>
<seg id="91">A non-specific evaluation of the pharmacogeninetics has no reference to clinically significant differences in ethnic origin or the effect of smoking on the pharmacogeninetics of Aripibilzol.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacogenic properties of Aripibilzol and Dehydro-Aripibilzol were similar in patients with severe kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study at Probanden with different catching-cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of the liver function of Aripibilisi, but the study covered only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of class C, which is not enough to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies on security issues, toxicity, toxicity, toxicity, genotoxicity and for canogenous potential, the preclinical data made no special hazards to humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicological effects were merely observed in dosages or expressions, which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans, so they have limited or no meaning for the clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects revolve a dosisdependent side of the toxicity (Lipofuscin-Pigment-accumulation and / or parench.-noosis in humans) and an increase in tricycles / carcinomes / carcinomes at 60 mg / kg / day (the 10fold of the middle Steady-State-Exposure (AUC) at the recommended Maximaldosis in humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">Furthermore, a Cholelithiasis has been observed as a result of the precipitation of Sulfate-conjuction of Aripibilzol from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (the 1-3) of the mid-sized Steady-State-Exposure (AUC) at the recommended dose dose or the 16- to 81times of recommended Maximaldosis in people based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, in the human Galle with the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg of concentrations of hydroxy- Aripibilzol no more than 6% of concentrations that have been established in the study over 39 weeks in the Gall of Monkeys, and lie far below the limits (6%) of the vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits these effects were observed after dosages, which resulted in expositions of 3- and 11ine of the medium steam-state AUC at the recommended clinical Maximaldosis.</seg>

<seg id="300">Herds of oversensitivity 1 The frequency of oversensitivity will be calculated based on a defined in relation to a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">Since these events have been reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of actual frequency are possible and it was established no special connection with these events.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an antimikrotubuli drug, which promotes the cohesion of the Mikrotubuli and stabilizes the Mikrotubuli by inhibitation of their deolymerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">These stabilization leads to a inhibitory of the normal dynamic reorganization of the mikrotubulky network, which is essential for the vital interphase and the well-gothic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is well-known that Albumin the transzythosis of Plasmakomponents conveys and in the framework of in-vitro trials, proved that the presence of Albumbs supported the transport of Paclitaxel through the endothelcells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transendothelial transport through the gp-60-Albumineptor is conveyed and due to the albuminary Proteins (anthted protein sildic Rich in cysteine) an Paclitaxel accumulation in the field of the tumors.</seg>
<seg id="306">The application of Abrasiane for metastatic Mammakinzinom is supported by the data of 106 patients in two single-related studies and of 454 patients, which were treated in a randomised phase-III peditions.</seg>

<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal bleeding data in case where intervention can occur in connection with a blood transfusion complications in case the intervention is not possible to expect a blood loss from 900 to 1 800 ml.</seg>
<seg id="361">Treatment with Abseamed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is shown.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a self-blood circulation, Abseamed is injected into a vene.</seg>
<seg id="363">The injection can also be carried out from the patient or a supervisor where appropriate guidance can be obtained.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic kidney failure or in patients who receive chemotherapy, the hemoglobinvalues should always be in the recommended area (between 10 and 12 grams per decilformers in adults respectively between 9.5 and 11 g / dl of children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The Iron of all patients are before treatment to ensure that no iron gel is made, and iron supplements should be administered during the entire treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients who receive a chemotherapy, or in patients with kidney problems, an anemia can be caused by a erythropographic organ or by the fact that the body speaks not sufficient to the body's body thropoids.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also applied to operations to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of blood pressure.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell that has been produced by a gene (DNA) that it proved to become the formation of epetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">Abseamed was compared with administration as an injection in a vene in the context of a main stubulation with 479 patients who suffered in one by kidney problems caused by reference.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients participating in this study was at least eight weeks of Eprex / Erypo had been injected into a vene before they were either deamed to deamed or continued to Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">Major indicators for the efficacy was the change of heretic values between the beginning of the study and the survey period in weeks 25 to 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also placed the results of a study in which the effects of under the skin supritated Abseamed were investigated with those of Eprex / Erypo at 114 cancers who received a chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study with patients who suffered in one by kidney problems, the hemoglobiness were caused by patients who were imprisoned at Abseamed as in the same measure as with those who received Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">Compared to that, patients showed Eprex / Erypo received an increase of 0.063 g / dl of the output value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effect of Abseamed is an increase in blood pressure, which occasionally lead to symptoms of an encephalopathy (encephalopathy) such as sudden, stinged headaches and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Abseamed may not be used in patients who may possibly persensitive (allergic) against epoxetine alfa or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="377">Abseamed as injecting under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems, as further studies are required to ensure that this has been triggered by any allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee on Humanpharynx (CHMP) was finished to conclude that for Abseamed, in accordance with the provisions of the European Union of evidence was provided that the medicines has a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile such as Eprex / Erypo.</seg>

<seg id="750">Actos is applied to the treatment of type-2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent Diabetes). • It can be used alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially overweight patients) in which metformin (a diabetesmedikament) is not shown. • It can be used together with another diabetesmedikament (DualTherapy).</seg>
<seg id="751">It can additionally be applied to metformin for patients (especially overweight patients) that can not be satisfactory with metformin alone in the highest tolerable dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a Sulfonylharnstoff or insulin the previous dose of Sulfylharnrogen or insulin can be maintained at the beginning of the Actos treatment, except for patients with hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar); here should be reduced the dose of Sulfonylharnrogen or inulate.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body of your own insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases, which makes the type 2 diabetes better set.</seg>
<seg id="754">With more than 1 400 patients the effectiveness of Actos in tripletherapy has been studied; in addition, patients received a combination of metformin with a Sulfonylharnstoff, in addition they received up to 3.5 years of either Actos or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylized Hämoglobin, HbA1c) measured that indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to lowering the HbA1c value, which suggests that the blood sugar levels in application of doses of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg have been reduced.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the tripletherapy study the effect of the extra gift of Actos to existing treatment with metformin and a Sulfonylharnant demonstrated in a lowering of the HbA1c values around 0,94%, while the additional gift of placebo to a lowering of 0,35% resulted.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study, in which the combination of Actos and insulin used for 289 patients were examined, the patients, the Actos in addition to insulin tests, a reduction of the HbA1c values of exactly 6% after 6 months, compared to 0.14% in the patient which took additional placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common side effects related to Actos were visual disorders, infections of the upper breathing paths (colds), weight gain and hypoesthesia (decreased sensitivity to maturity).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos must neither be used for patients who may possibly take hypersensitive (allergic) towards Pioglitazone or one of the other ingredients, nor in patients with liver issues, heart failure or diabetic ketoer (high stresses - infacidity - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that Actos in the context of monotherapy (during the universal treatment) as an alternative to the default treatment with metformin in patients should be shown in which metformin is not shown.</seg>

<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also indicated for combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar has been inadequate, and where metformin due to contraindications or intolerance is unsuitable (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">For use of pioglitazon in patients under 18 years of age, no data is available, therefore the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients who are endangered by the presence at least a risk factor (e.g. former coronary heart disease or symptomatic coronary heart illness), the doctor should begin the treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually.</seg>

<seg id="796">In the over a period of 3.5 years of ongoing proactive study, fractures performed at 44 / 870 (5.1%) of the patients treated with Pioglitazon treated with 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients with a comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the presumped maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days occurred no symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone seems to act by activating specific core receptors (Peroxisome Proliferator, Receptor-g (PPAR-g)), which leads in the animal-model to an increased inulate of liver, lipid and skeletal cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazon reduces Glucoseproduktion in the liver and the peripheral gluctionstandings in the case of an insulin resistant.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with Pioglitazon versus Gliclazid as monotherapy was conducted over two years to examine the time until after the therapeutic effects (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8,0% after the first 6 treatments).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the start of therapy it was able to maintain blood sugar control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8,0%) by Pioglitazon at 69% of the patients to be treated (compared to 50% of the patients below Gliclazide).</seg>

<seg id="809">In a study about 20 weeks of reduced pioglitazon not only the sober-orglyceride, but also improved the postprandial dis-level mirror, this is both an effect on the Triglycerid absorption and the hepatic Triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the proactive study, a cardiovascular study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced makrovasculans in groups were randomised that were additionally applied over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular and placebo.</seg>
<seg id="811">According to oraler application, Pioglitazis quickly resorated, with the peak concentration of unmodified Pioglitazone in plasma usually reaches 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">Based on this basis, the contribution of M-IV applies to the efficacy of the effectiveness of Pioglitazon, whereas the relative humidity of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In Interaction studies, it could be proven that Pioglitazis has no relevant effect on the pharmacogenic or pharmacodynamics of Digoxin, Warrine, Phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>

<seg id="1176">In comparison to this, this was 22% (60 of 268) of patients suffering from Allopurinol and in none of the 134 patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1177">The most common side effects of Adenuric (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are headaches, diarrhea, nausea (nausea), rash and abnormal liver values.</seg>
<seg id="1178">Especially in patients with cardiac disease, possibly there is also an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels.</seg>
<seg id="1179">The Committee on Humanpharynx (CHMP) ended in the conclusion that Adenuric was more effective in lowering the urinary tract in the blood but also a higher risk of side-effects associated with the heart and blood vessels.</seg>
<seg id="1180">The treatment of chronic hyperurikemia management patients who have already led to urine formations (including one out of the sickle known or currently present Gather-notation and / or a Gichpin).</seg>
<seg id="1181">If the serumpers plan after 2-4 weeks still is &gt; 6 mg / dl (357 µmol / l), can be considered a dosage increase on ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily.</seg>
<seg id="1182">In patients with severe kidney efforts, effectiveness and safety have not yet been fully examined (creatinin- clearance &lt; 30 ml / min, see Section 5.2).</seg>

<seg id="1188">Liver ailconditions During the clinical trials of phase 3 were light realities of the liver functioning, treated with Febuxostat treated patients (3.5%).</seg>
<seg id="1189">It is therefore advised to run before the Febuxostatine treatment and in the further course depending on the clinical trial (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1190">Theophylline Zwar were not performed any exchange studies on Febuxostat, but it is known that the XO inhibitration can lead to an increase in the theophyllins (an imitation of the metabolic acid of theophylline was also reported for other XO inhibitor).</seg>
<seg id="1191">In Probanden, the simultaneous gift of Febuxostat and naproxen 250 mg 2 x daily associated with an increase in the fur-condition (Cmax 28%, AUC 41% and T1 / 2 26%).</seg>
<seg id="1192">In clinical studies the application of Naproxen or other NSAR / Cox-2 Hemann is not associated with a clinically significant increase of undesirable events.</seg>
<seg id="1193">Colchicin / Indometacin / hydrochlorthiazid / Warfarin Febuxostat can be used together with Colchicin or Indometacin, without that a dosage adjustment for Febuxostat or at the same time is required.</seg>
<seg id="1194">In a study involving Probanden-effective 120 mg of ADENURIC 1 x daily a medium 22% increase in AUC from Desipramine, a CYP2D6 substrate, which indicates a possible weak inhibitory effect of Febuxostat to CYP2D6-enzymm in vivo.</seg>
<seg id="1195">Antazida It could be shown that includes simultaneous intake of a antacid, the magnesium-hydroxid and aluminium-hydroxid contains, the absorption of Febuxostat (about 1 hour) delayed and a decrease in the Cmax around 32%, however no significant change from AUC causes.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Pregnant data on a very limited number of exponized pregnancies can not be resolved on the side effects of Febuxostat on the pregnancy or health of fetus / newborns.</seg>

<seg id="1293">3 The risk of severe vicious side-side effects seems to be increased in patients who are not taking their medicine properly and / or it is based on the appearance of symptoms which refer to a malophonic irritation.</seg>
<seg id="1294">It is very important that all dosing instructions can be given to the patient and be understood by the patient (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1295">While in large clinical trials by Alendronat no increased risk has been established, rare (after market introduction) gastric and Duodenalulls, including some severe viruses and with complications, reported (see Section 4.8).</seg>

<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences in the systemic exposure of Tacrolimus, this can lead to transplants or an increased incidence of side effects, including sub- or overimmunossuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always keep the same tacrolimus formulation and maintain appropriate daily dosage; conversions of the formulation or of the regime should only be made under the narrative control of one in the transplantation (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">As a result of conversion to an alternative formulation, a therapeutic medication must be carried out and appropriate dosing adapts can be carried out to ensure that systemic exposure to Tacrolimus remains.</seg>

<seg id="1435">Since Advagraf is a medicine with a low Clearance, adjustments of the dose may require several days until the Steady State has been assigned.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical studies allow that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the mirror in blood 20 ng / ml cannot exceed.</seg>

<seg id="1643">The virus in Advocene is a "Adenovirus" which was changed so that there cannot produce a copies of yourself and thus cannot prevent infections in the human being.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advocapproach would have donated directly into the tumors and allow the cancerous cells to build the normal p53-protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein that is made out of the not broken down in the human body available p53-gene, normally contributes to the restoration of corrupt DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1646">At Li-Fraumeni-cancer, where the p53-gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work properly, and the cancers can continue to grow and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company put data from a study with a patient in front of the Li-Fraumeni-cancer in the area of the subset, into the bones and in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After CHMP did the answer of the company on the questions asked questions were still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the testing of initial documentation the CHMP will be created on day 120 a list of questions that will be sent to the company.</seg>
<seg id="1650">After the CHMP, the injecting of Advexin was argued in Li-Fraumeni-Tumore benefits for patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee also had concerns about the processing of medicinal products in the body, the nature of administration, and the security of medication.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company had not proven sufficient to be established in a reliable way and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who arrive in close contact with the patient that is detrimental.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company did not know the CHMP whether the withdrawal consequences for patients has, which are currently participating in clinical trials or "Compassionate-Use" programs with Advexin.</seg>

<seg id="1656">For adults and young people aged 12 years, the recommended dose of aerobts is twice daily a tablet that should be taken whole with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and finished once the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nose-mucosa (petrified nose), claddling.</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effect of medication means effect on the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main-performance measurements were the changes of the severity of the havores of the havoirs, which were reported by the patient before the start of the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients carried their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and rated with a standard scale, how heavy the symptoms were over the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In view of all the havores of the nose, the patients, the aerobots reported the patients who took aerosze over a decrease of exposure to 46,0%, compared to 35,9% in patients who took Pseudoephedrin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nose-mucosa was seen below the patients showed an alleviation of symptoms by 37,4% compared to 26,7% in patients who took desloratadin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of aerosze (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachykarst (carditis), aphygitis (acts of anti-inflammation), constipation, headache, fatigue, insomnever (sleeplness), somnolenz (sadness), sleep disorders and nervousness.</seg>

<seg id="1671">After the drop of the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper breathing difficulties, the treatment can be continued with desloratadine as monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since aerosze pseudoephedrine contains, the drug is also contrasting in patients suffering from a monoaminoxidase (MAO) inhibitor within 2 weeks after the termination of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to the alphamimetical activity in combination of pseudoephedrals with other vasodicular, Pergothic, Cabergolin, Lisurid, Cabyamin, phenylephrine, Ephedrine, Oxymetazolin, Napselkaetc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The security and effectiveness of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient reflection and the data are not enough to address the respective recommendations for dosing.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and the efficacy of aerosensic were not tested in patients with kidney or liver functioning and the data are not sufficient to persevering appropriate recommendations for dosage.</seg>

<seg id="1898">This is the immune system later in a position to make contact with a flu-virus this pedigree more quickly.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the membrane-case of the virus with the "surface area" (proteins on the membrane surface, which sees the human body as physical-alien), adjusting and used as a part of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">"" "a survey of some of the study centres showed that the study was not performed in accordance with" "" "good clinical practice" "" "(GCP)." ""</seg>
<seg id="1901">Thus, the scope of the clinical data base for assessing the security of the vaccine is not to fulfill the requirements of the EMEA guidelines for prepandemic vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Should you take part in clinical trials and need more information about your treatment, please contact your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="1903">For more information regarding the recommendations of CHMP, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="1904">It is applied in combination with other antiviral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years, associated with the humanos immune-virus from type 1 (HIV-1) which causes the acquired immune-immune syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients who can't be smells any capsules, Agenerase is available as a solution to the insertion, but these can not be taken along with Ritonavir because the security of this combination was not examined.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Agenerase should only be ordered once the doctor has checked which antiviral drugs has previously taken before, and the likelihood has judged that the virus will address the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years amounts to 600 mg twice daily, which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg of Ritonavir and other anti-viral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1908">For children between four and twelve years and in patients with a weight of less than 50 kg the recommended dose of Agenerase is governed by body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">Vgenerase decreases in combination with other antiviral drugs the HIV-quantity in the blood and keeps them on a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">AIDS not to heal, however, can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also delay the development of with AIDS infections and illnesses.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenerase was examined in combination with other antiviral medicines, but without Ritonavir, examined in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adult, who had previously been treated with protocols.</seg>
<seg id="1912">This compared with low dosified ritonavir increased drug Agenerase was taken at 206 adults, the formerly protocols of the former protocols.</seg>
<seg id="1913">Major indicators for the efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-retardant concentrations of HIV in the blood (Viruslast) or the change of the virglast after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In studies with patients who had previously had no protagonisms, even after 48 weeks under Agenerase more patients had a Viral last less than 400 copies / ml as placebo, but Agenerase was less effective than Indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">With children reduced Agenerase also the Viruslast, however, were treated by the children, who were treated earlier with protagonisms, very few to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study involving adults, which were treated earlier with protagonisms, associated with Ritonavir increased drug Agenerase the Viruslast after 16-week treatment just as effective as other protocols</seg>
<seg id="1917">In patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other protagoners, it came under Agenerase along with Ritonavir to a stronger failure of the Viruslast after four weeks than in the patients who continued their former protocols.</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of Agenerase (observed with more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, diarrhoea (diarrhores), Flatulence (blizzling), nausea (nausea), vomiting, rash and Fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenerase may not be used in patients who may possibly persensitive (allergic) against amplavr or one of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Agenerase may also not be used in patients who are Johanniskraut (an herbal supplement for treating depression) or medicines that are just as vgenerase, and in high concentrations in the blood of health-harmful are taking.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines on HIV exists in patients, the Agenerase, taking the risk of a podystrophy (changes in the distribution of the body-fat), a osteonecular (descending of bone tissue) or an immune system of syndroms (symptoms of an infection which are caused by the resting immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee on Humanpharynx (CHMP) enacted to the conclusion that the benefits of Agenerase in use in combination with other antiretroviral medicines used to treat with protagonisms in HIV-1-infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenerase is usually taken along with pharmacogeninetic amplifier, but the committee demonstrated that the use of vgenerase have taken in combination with Ritonavir in patients who had previously had no protagonism before.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"" "Agenerase was originally registered under" "" "exceptional circumstances" "" "because at the time of approval for scientific reasons only limited information." ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission for the company Glaxo Group Limited was approved for approval by Agenerase in the whole of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Agenerase is used in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of HIV-1- infected, protagonisers (PI) -regated adults and children over the age of 4.</seg>
<seg id="1927">For usually, Agenerase capsules are to be administered by pharynavir in pharynavir together with low doses of Ritonavir together with low doses of Ritonavir (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of Ampulmong should take place under consideration the individual viral resistance movement and the treatment treatment of the patient (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of Ameliavir as a solution to the insertion is around 14% lower than of Ameliavir as a capsule; therefore are Agenerase capsules and solution for taking on a milligram per milligram basis are not interchangeable (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 600 mg of amotavir twice daily with 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2. when Agenerase capsules used without the amplifying additive of Ritonavir (Booadding), higher doses should be applied to Agenerase (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg of amotavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg Amplavir that should not be exceeded (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">The pharmacogenic, effectiveness and safety of vgenerase in combination with low doses of Ritonavir or other protagonies were not examined in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenerase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years, due to the lack of data to harmlessness and effectiveness (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacogenic data the dose of Agenerase capsules should be reduced the dose of Agenerase capsules in adult sufferings at 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver functioning on 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The simultaneous application is to be carried out in patients with mild or moderate liver functioning, in patients with severe liver functioning, it is contrasting indices (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Agenerase may not simultaneously be given to pharmaceuticals, who own a low therapeutic width and also depicting substrate of the Cytochrom P450-Isoenzyms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal supplements which threw the Johanniskraut (hypericum perforatum) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma-centrations and a diminished therapeutic effect of amplavr during the intake of amplavr (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be advised that Agenerase or any other antiretroviral therapy does not cause a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of a HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy, including the treatment with Agenerase, does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">For usually, Agenerase capsules are to be used together with low doses of Ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral medicines (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral combination therapy, have a increased risk for severe liver effects with potentially deadly course.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the case of simultaneous antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C, please read the relevant information provided for this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with reduced mobility function, including a chronic-active hepatitis, an increased incidence of liver operations under a antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to the clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous application of Agenerase and Ritonavir with fluticason or other Glukokortikoids, which have become more than CYP3A4, is not recommended unless the potential benefits of a treatment risk systemic corrosion effects including Morbus Cups and Suppsion of the secondary function (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the metabolism of the HMG-CoA-Reduktase-Hemmer Lovastatin and simvastatin has been dependent on CYP3A4, is a simultaneous agreement of Agenerase with Lovastatin and simvastatin because of the elevated risk of Myopathies including Rhudomyolysen not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines, which can cause serious or life-threatening effects, such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under control of the International Standarised ratio), are available for the determination of the ingredient concentration.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients who are taking these medicines at the same time, Agenerase can be less effective because of decrepit plasmasks or less effective (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with Ampulmonr can be the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptive pills, however the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">When methadone is given simultaneously with ampledges, patients should therefore be monitored on the symptom symptoms, especially if there are also low doses of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Due to the potential risk of toxicity due to the high propylenglycolgehalts of the Agenerase solution to the insertion is this presentation in children under an age of four years, and should be used with caution at certain other patients.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Agenerase should be set on duration 5 if a rash are accompanied by systemic or allergic symptom or are involved in mucous membranes (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">In patients who received an antiretroviral therapy including protocols, was reported on the appearance of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycaemia or an exazerbation of an existing diabetes mellitus.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other diseases, regarding their therapy drugs were necessary to be associated with the development of diabetes mellitus or a hyperglycaemia.</seg>

<seg id="1956">In case of seedophiles patients (type A and B), which were treated with protocols, are reports of an increase in bleeding including spontaneous glutas hematoms and hematthroes.</seg>
<seg id="1957">With HIV-infected patients with severe immune defective patients may develop a inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections, which leads to severe clinical conditions or deterioration of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although a multifactorial eology is accepted (including application of cortical resources, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrose especially in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long-term application of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrate with low therapeutic width Agenerase may not simultaneously be given to pharmaceuticals, who own a low therapeutic width and also depicting substrate of the Cytochrom P450-Isoenzyms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrate with low therapeutic width Agenerase with Ritonavir must not be merged along with drugs whose active ingredients are primarily associated with CYP2D6 and are associated with severe Plasmasonry with serious and / or life-threatening effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It was shown that Rifampicin is caused by a 82% reduction of AUC from Amplavr which can lead to a virology failure and to a resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In the attempt to compensate the low plasma surface by a dosage increase of other protease inhibitors in combination with Ritonavir, were very frequently undesirable effects observed at the liver.</seg>
<seg id="1963">Johanniskraut (hypericum perforatum) The Serummirror of Ameliavir can be degradated by the simultaneous application of herbal equations with Johanniskraut (hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient is already matured on Johanniskraut, are the amplush level and, if possible to review the Viruslast and defired the currant.</seg>
<seg id="1965">A dosage adjustment for one of the drugs is not required if Nelumavir is administered along with amplavir (see also the eavavion at the bottom).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increased, for Cmax on the other hand increased by 30% when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) in combination with amotavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials, dosages of 600 mg are applied twice daily and Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily, which occupy the effectiveness and inconceivable of this treatment cinematography.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% lower if Ameliavir (750 mg twice daily) in combination with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of amotavir in plasma, which were obtained in the combination of amotavir (600 mg twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily), approximately 40 to 50% lower than if Ampulavir (600 mg twice daily) in combination with 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1970">A dosage recommendations for simultaneous administration of Ampulviolr and Kaletra may not be given, however, there will be a narcott monitoring, as the effectiveness and inconceivable of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">No pharmacokinetic study was conducted for use by Agenerase in combination with Didanosin, but due to the indemary component of Didanosine, is recommended that the income of didanosin and nogenerase are at least one hour apart.</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore at gift of Efavion, in combination with Amswavir (600 mg twice daily) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) no dosage adjustment required.</seg>
<seg id="1973">The treatment with Efavion in combination with Amswavir and Saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protagonisms.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of Nevirapin on other protocols and existing limited data can be presently that Nevirapin the Serumkonzentration of Ampulviolr might be lowers.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these medicines should be used simultaneously, caution is recommended as Delavirdin because of the reduced and possibly subtherapeutic properties less effective.</seg>
<seg id="1976">When these drugs are applied together, caution is recommended; a thorough clinical and virology monitoring should be carried out as an exact prediction of the effect of combination of amplavr and Ritonavir on Delavirdin difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous gift of amotavir and rifabutin resulted in an increase of plasma-centration (AUC) by rifabutin at 193% and therefore an increase in associated with rifabutin-effects.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons, rifabutin may be administered along with Agenerase, becomes a reduction in the dosage of rifabutin on at least half of the recommended dose, although no clinical data are required.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmaceutical Studies with Agenerase in combination with Erythromycin were not conducted but could be the Plasmasks of both drugs in case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg Fosamprenavir and 100 mg of Ritonavir with 200 mg of ketoconazol at plasma around 25% and the AUC (0-ear) to the 2,6954 compared to the value that has been observed after 200 mg ketoconazol once a day without simultaneous application of Fosampadavir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines that are listed below, including substrates, inhibitor inductors of CYP3A4, can occur if they are used together with Agenerase possibly to interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be based on toxic reactions, associated with these medicines, if they are used in combination with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other protagonist it is advisable that Antazida are not taken at the same time as Agenerase, as it can come to Resorptionsstörungen.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous application of anticonvulsiva, which are known as an enzydeine, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with amplavir can lead to a degradation of plasma jet.</seg>
<seg id="1985">The serum concentrations of calcium-channel block such as Amlodipin, Dilodipin, rocky, rocky, Nisoldipin, Nisoldipin and verapamil can be increased by Ampulmonr, thus increasing the activity and toxicity of these drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Simultaneous intake involving Agenerase can substantially increase and increase using PDE5-Inhibitors associated with PDE5-Inhibitors, including Hypotension, visual dysfunctions and priapism (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study, in the Ritonavir 100 mg capsules twice daily with 50 µg fluticasonpropionat intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days at Probanden, stibutable the fluticasonpropionat Plasticaspionate (90% -Confidenzinterval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">Consequently, the simultaneous gift of Agenerase with Ritonavir is not recommended together with these glucokortikoids, unless the potential benefits of a treatment weighs the risk of systemic corrosive effect (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">At HMG-CoA concentric plugs, such as Lovastatin and simvastatin, whose metabolism is strongly dependent from CYP3A4, are pronounced validations of Plasmaspiegel in simultaneous administration of Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since Plasmaspiegelincrease of these HMG-CoA remembrance to Myopathy, including a rhudomyolysis, the combined application of these medicines will not be recommended with amotavir.</seg>
<seg id="1991">It will be a common monitoring of therapeutic concentrations up to stabilising the mirror since the plasma-concentration of cyclosporin, Rapamycin and Tacrolimus can be raised by Amswavir (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, Agenerase may not be applied together with orally used Midazolam (see Section 4.3), whereas for simultaneous application of Agenerase is offered with the parcranal Midazolam caution.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for the simultanious use of parenteral Midazolam with other protocorbitors to a possible increase in plasma cutting from Midazolam around the 3- to 4-fold.</seg>
<seg id="1994">When methadon together with amaliavir should suffice, patients should therefore be monitored on the symptom of symptoms, especially if there are also low doses of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Because of the minimal permeability of historical comparisons, no recommendation can currently be given as the amotavige- dose is to adapt if amviolavir is administered at the same time with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">In case of simultaneous babe of warriin or other oral antibodies, together with Agenerase, an increased monitoring of INR (International Standarised ratio) because of the possibility of a weak or reinforcement of antithrombotic effect. (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of Ritonavir on hormonal contraceptive pills is not predictable, therefore alternative methods are recommended for receptive prevention.</seg>
<seg id="1998">A careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended in simultaneous gift of Agenerase (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">This medicine may only be used during pregnancy only after careful weighing of potential crops for the mother in comparison to the potential risks for fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">In the milk lactic rats have been proven, though, however, it is not known whether Ameliavir goes into the mother's milk.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A response level of impairments which was administered by lowering in the uterus until the end of the lactation Ampulmonr was displayed, during the lactation period a diminished increase in the 12 body weight.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The further development of the revenue, including fertilisation and reproduction capacity was not affected by the administration of amplavir to the mother.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The invariability of Agenerase was examined in adults and in children 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with different antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most connected with the Agenerase treatment related side effects were slightly up to moderate, occurred early on and rarely brought out to treatment breakage.</seg>
<seg id="2005">In many of these events, it is not clear whether they are in connection with the intake of Agenerase or another at the same time to HIV treatment applied to HIV treatment or whether they are a result of diunderdiseases.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the side-below side effects are from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which with protocols did not pre-treated patients 1200 mg Agenerase twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (level 2 to 4) written by the investigators in connection with the studies of research and in more than 1% of the patients were performed, as well as under the treatment of tread laboratory changes (degrees 3 to 4) are listed.</seg>
<seg id="2008">The anti-retroviral combination therapy was associated with a redistribution of the body-functioning (Lipodystrophy) with HIV-patients, including a loss of peripheral and faecal obesity, hypertrophering and visceral obesity, hypertrophia of the breasts and dorsocratic fat.</seg>
<seg id="2009">Under 113 antiretroviral not pre-treated persons who were treated with Amvudin / Zidovudin on a medium duration of 36 weeks, was only observed one case (Stiappoints) (&lt; 1%).</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the study PROAB 3006 occurred at 245 NRTI- pre-treated patients with amotavir 7 cases (3%) compared to 27 cases (11%) at 241 patients with Indinavir, in combination with different NRTIs over a medium duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0,001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Skin types are normally mild to moderate, recurring issues or fulopapulous nature, with or without itch and occurred generally spontaneously during the second treatment week and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks, without the treatment with amotavir had to be broken.</seg>

<seg id="2291">With Aldurazyme treated patients may develop infusion-related reactions, which are defined as any related side effect, which occurs during infusion or until the end of the infusion (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason especially these patients should continue to be monitored narrowly monitored, and infusion of infduracyme should only be carried out in a reasonable clinical setting, in which revitalisation institutions will be available immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase-3 study, we expect to form nearly all patients IgG antibodies against Laronidase, usually within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of a infusion-related reaction must be treated with caution in use by Aldurazyme (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">As little experience regarding the resumption of treatment after a longer break, must be cautious due to the theoretically increased risk response to a interruption of treatment.</seg>

<seg id="2303">Since no data on newborn, which were exposed to Laronidase over the mother's milk, is recommended, during treatment with Alduracyme not to breastfeed.</seg>
<seg id="2304">The effects in clinical trials were predominantly classified as infusion-related reactions, which were observed at 53% of patients in the phase 3-study (treatment duration up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years of age (treatment duration up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Unwanted medicines related to Aldurazyme, which were observed during the phase-3 study and its extension in a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older at a treatment duration of up to 4 years, are frequently (≥ 1 / 10); often (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>

<seg id="2311">Patients suffering from low antibody mirror for a robust detriment of the GAG Spiegels in Harn, while in patients with high anti-bodies an variable lowering of GAG in Harn was to be noticed.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in the phase-3 study and one in the Phase 2 study) showed a marginally until low neutral inhibitory activity on enzymatic Laronization activity in vitro, which seemed to not affect the clinical effectiveness and / or the reduction of GAG in the Harn.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not seem to stand in connection with the incidence of undesirable drug transactions, even if the appearance of undesirable drug transactions typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reason for the Enzymosis therapy is in one for the hydrolysis of the akcumulated substrate and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient enzymes.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion, Laronidase is quickly removed from the circulation and of cells in the lymphomas, most likely over Mannose-6-phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and effectiveness of alduracyme were examined in a randomised, double-blinded, placebo phase-3 study on 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were reprinted for the study dedicated to the entire sickness spectrum, the majority of patients were on the middle of the medium size and only a patient turned to the heavy prototype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were reprinted if they had a researched expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">Primary endpoints for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the FEV and the absolute distance in the 6-minutary test.</seg>

<seg id="2327">A one-year-year-2 study conducted in which mainly the security and pharmacogenic inetics was examined by Alduracyme in 20 patients who were at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years old (16 patients with the heavy punching form) and 4 with the intermediate circuit form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage was increased due to increased GAG- mirror at the Harn in week 22 in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg.</seg>
<seg id="2329">For several patients there was an end growth (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) determined to the Z-Score for this age group The younger patients with the middle orbit form (&lt; 2.5 years) and every 4 patients with the middle orbit has limited a normal mental speed velocity to the older patients with severe infeed form, or not in no progress in cognitive development.</seg>

<seg id="2621">Apart from connection with another chemotherapy, Aloxi should neither be used to prevent chemotherapy for the treatment of nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies inhibited Palonosetron the against tumors judicial activity of the five interconnected chemical therapeutics not (Cisplatin, Cyclophosphamide, Cycloabin, Doxorubicin and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study did not prove a significant pharmacogenic interaction between a unique intravenous dose Palonosetron and a Steady-state- concentration oralen metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 Inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In one on a population based pharmacogenic analysis was shown that the simultaneous gift of CYP2D6 Inhibitors (Amiodaron, Cinidine, Periodidin, Rendsine, ritonavir, Sertralin and Terapafin) had no significant impact on the clearance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experience for the use of Palonosetron for human pregnancies are not before, therefore Palonosetron should not be used at Schwangers, unless it is considered to be treated as required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical studies the most commonly used in a dose of 250 micrograms to observed side effects (total 633 patients), which at least possibly were with aloxi in connection, headaches (9%) and trolley (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of over-sensitivity actions and reactions to the destination (burning, hardening, discomfort and pain) were given in post-marketing experiences.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage indicated similar frequency of unfavourable events as in the other dosing groups; there were no dose-active relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2629">There have been no dialysis studies because of the large distribution volume, however, is probably no effective therapy at a Aloxi- overdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double blindented studies have been compared with ≤ 50 mg / m2, Carboplatin, ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 of cyclophosphamide, and 100 mg / m2 (half-time 4 hours) or 100 mg dolasetron (half-time 7,3 hours), which was given to Day 1 without Dexamethason intravenous intravenous.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double blindstuds the total of 667 patients, who received a strong emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 Cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazin, as well as 250 or 750 micrograms Palonosetron, with patients compared to which 32 mg Ondansetron received that were given on Day 1 intravenous.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of the studies with default emetogenic chemotherapy and the study with strong emetogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical studies on the indication of chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) were the effects of Palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including the respective effects of Ondansetron and Dolasetron comparable.</seg>
<seg id="2634">After the presumented studies, Palonosetron has the ability to block at ventricular DE- and Repolarisation involved and prolong the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study carried out in 221 healthy volunteers, was the assessment of the ECG effects of i.v. administered Palonosetron in retailer of 0,25, 0,75 and 2,25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption Up intravenous fermentation follows an initiating the plasma centrations a slow Elimination from the body with an average terminals half-time-time of about 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum Plasmakonzentration (Cmax) and the area below the concentration time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally proportional to the entire dosage range of 0.3- 90 μ g / kg in case of circular and cancers.</seg>
<seg id="2638">After intravenous Gabe of Palonosetron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the average number of 11 testicle cardiac patients between day 1 and day 5 measured medium (± SD) increase of the Palonosetron-Plasseronzentration at 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">From pharmacogeninetic simulations come forth, that at once a daily intravenous casting of 0,25 mg Palonosetron on 3 consecutive days achieved total of 0.75 mg reported value; however, the Cmax was higher after the default of 0,75 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated about the kidneys and some more 50% are converted into two primary metabolic disorders that are compared to Palonosetron over less than 1% of the antagonistic impact on the 5HT3 receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro-studies on metabolic studies have shown that CYP2D6 and, in inferior size, the Isoenzyme CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 at the Metabolism of Palonosetron are involved.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination of a intravenous individual dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron became approximately 80% of the dose within 144 hours in urine, Palonosetron as an unaltered ingredient made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a unique intravenous bolster, the total physical activity is 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">While in patients with severe liver functioning the terminale elimination of Elimination time and the average systemic exposure with Palonosetron increases, a reduction of dose is however unjustified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical trials, effects were observed only after expositions which can be seen enough about the maximum human therapeutic effect, which indicates a low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 From preclinical trials are evidence that Palonosetron can block only in very high concentrations of Ionary channels and relies in the ventricular DE- and Repolarization and can extend the potentials of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses Palonosetron (any dose entails in approximately the 30ples of therapeutic exposure to humans), which were given daily over two years, led to an increased incidence of liver, endokrines, pancreas, pancreatic, pancreas, pannierenmark) and skin tumors with rats, however not with mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not completely known, but due to the used high doses and since Aloxi is intended for the unique application, the relevance of these results is low evaluated for the human being.</seg>

<seg id="2669">Furthermore, concerns have expressed concerns that the data for the stability of the drug and the market-market have not been insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients infected with hepatitis C, which spoke to the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A, was similar in clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After setting the treatment with Alpheon flammed the disease in more patients compared to the reference pharma; additionally, aleon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from that, the testing performed in the study tests for examining the question, however the drug is an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibody - special proteins - against the drug) dissolves not sufficiently validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It may be used for treating impetigo (one with Kruary-formation incoming skin infection) and small infied lazy (Riss- or Schnittwunden), discared and gendered wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used to treat infections, which pertinently or probably caused by methicillinresistant to hylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alargo against this kind of infections might not work.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be applied in patients from the age of nine months, yet in patients under 18 years of age, which may not exceed 2% of the body surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient speaks not on the treatment after two to three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking of bacterial Ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced) and thereby inhibit the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">Hauptindikator of the effectiveness came in all five studies of the proportion of patients, their infection was bottled after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of 139 patients decreased by Altargo and 37 (52,1%) of 71 patients to placebo for the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected persons, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar contact: if the results of both studies have been taken together with the hood issues, approximately 90% of the patients of both groups were raised to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">However, in these two studies, however, was noted that Altargo was caused in the treatment of disoaps (eitergearious bricks in the body tissues) or infections, which have been caused by MRSA was not effective enough.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side-effect with Altargo (which was observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is an irritation at the job place.</seg>

<seg id="2685">Patients in which two or three days no improvement shows, should be examined once more and will be considered an alternative therapy (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the event of a sensitization or severe local confusion due to the use of retapamulin Salbe, the treatment should be canceled, the salbe carefully decondense and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection can be started.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin should not be used to treat infections in which MRSA is known as exhaustive or suspected (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical trials at secondary open wounds the effectiveness of retapamulin was caused by patients with infections, which were caused by a methicillin resistant stackarcoccus aureus (MRSA), insufficient.</seg>

<seg id="2724">Ambirix is applied within the framework of one of two doses existing vaccines, whereby a protection against hepatitis B could only be achieved after administration of the second dose.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason ambitions may only be used when immunization a low risk of hepatitis B infection and is ensured that the existing vaccine can be brought into an end from two doses.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresher dose against hepatitis A or B is desired, Ambirix or another hepatitis A or B vaccine will be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines work by eliminating the immune system (the natural defende of the body), "as it can cure against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Once a child has received the vaccine, the immune system realizes the viruses and surface-antigens as a "alien" and produces antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same ingredients as approved since 1996 approved by Twinrix adults and the associated vaccine Twinrix children since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are applied to the protection against the same diseases but Twinrix adults and Twinrix kids are administered within one of three cans of existing vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix adults contain identical ingredients, some of the data which support the application of Twinrix adults, also used as cover for applying ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indikator for the efficacy was the proportion of the vaccinated children, who had developed a protective antibody after one month after the last injecting.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared to a six-month and a 12-month distance between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambitions led up between 98 and 100% of the vaccinated children a month after the last injection on the development of protective solids against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection of ambirix on a six-month and a 12-month distance between injections was similar.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of ambirix (observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccination) are headache, pepeon, redness, mats (fatigue) as well as irritability.</seg>

<seg id="2739">The standardisation plan for the Grundimmerszation with ambirix consists of two vaccines, whereby the first dose is administered at the date of election and the second dose between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a reflex is desired for hepatitis A as well as hepatitis B, the appropriate monovaltic vaccines can be vaccinated with the appropriate monovalenten vaccines or with a combined form of combination.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis against a vaccination simulated anti-hepatitis viruses (anti-HBsAg) - and anti-hepatitis A-virus (anti-HAV) -antibody values are in the same size as after vaccination with the respective monovalenten vaccines.</seg>

<seg id="2744">If a quick protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardization scheme is recommended with the combined simulated hepatitis A-A-virus and 10 µg recombinable hepatitis B surface.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In hematalytic septic and persons with disturbances of the immune system, after vaccination, no bounds anti-HAV- and Anti-HBS antibodies can be achieved so in these cases the gift of further vaccines can be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">As a intradermale injecting or intra-muscular administration can lead to a suboptimal vaccine to be avoided should these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">At Thromboctopenie or bloodonal disorders, Ambirix cannot be injected to injected subcutaneous since it can occur in these cases to intramuscular gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2748">When ambirix in second life year in the form of a separate injection, tetellular peromyelitis- and Haemophilus influenza type b-vaccine (DTPa-IPV / Hib) or using a combined mask is sufficient (see Section 5.1).</seg>

<seg id="2757">The frequency of pronounced soreness and mats was low and comparable to those who have observed after administration of the combined form with the 3-doses of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study for 1-year-year vaccination, the appearance of local actions and general actions in the ambirixgroup was comparable to that which is associated with the 3-doses of combined hepatitis C-A-virus and 10 µg recombinable hepatitis B-B surface.</seg>
<seg id="2759">From the 6- to 11- year-old, however, after vaccination with ambirix a frequent appearance of pain (at the injecting location) per dose, not per proband.</seg>

<seg id="2779">As with all vaccines, Ambirix not fully protect against an infection with hepatitis or hepatitis B virus, even if the full vaccine has been completed with 2 cans.</seg>
<seg id="2780">If you / your child are infected before the administration of both vaccines or hepatitis B virus (although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or ill / feel) a vaccination may not prevent a vaccination.</seg>
<seg id="2781">A protection against other infections that are causing the liver or symptoms that are similar to those after a hepatitis or hepatitis B infection can not be conveyed.</seg>

<seg id="2785">For a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination the doctor will tell you / your child from a vaccine with ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, it will recommend you / your child 3 injections of a combined hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced salute (360 ELISA units of a formalinactivated hepatitis A-virus and 10 micrograms of a recombinant hepatitis B-hardness).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccination of this vaccine with reduced salary to effective components usually culminated one month after the first dose and may lend your child a vaccination prior to termination of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes ambitions will suffer from people who are suffering from severe blood cells, under the skin and not in the muscle crashes. • if you / your child are weakened due to a disease or treatment in your / her body's body, or if you / your child shall undergo a hawalysis.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambitions can be given in these cases, but the immune response of these people on the vaccination can not be sufficient, so be a blood test may be necessary to see how strongly the reaction to the vaccination is.</seg>

<seg id="2791">But it can be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine must be given at the same time with Ambirix, should be vaccinated in separate positions and as many as possible limbs.</seg>
<seg id="2793">When ambirix starts at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immunoglobulins, it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient.</seg>

<seg id="2805">Based on data base, which has become known since redistribution of the first approval for the controller, the CHMP believes that the benefits-risk relationship for ambirix remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since Ambirix not only has been launched in one Member State (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available security data for this medicine is limited due to the low patient position.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonaps can also be used in patients aged over a month with an entire Enzympic or with hyperammonic encephalopathy (encephalopathy) in prehistory.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonaps is possible - split by several single pants to the meals - swallowed under the food or via a gastroar dentures (through the stomach in the stomach of leading hose) or a nasandonde (through the nose in the stomach of leading hose).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study since Ammonaps was not compared to another treatment or with placebo (a hypomedial ament, i.e., without drug).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonaps can also lead to appetizing, an abnormal calcium content in blood, depression, irritation, troubleshooting, creases, hydration, anti-pain, vomiting, instipation, rash, instipation, unpleasing body or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee on Humanpharynx (CHMP) enacted to the conclusion that ammonaps in patients with disorders of the urinary cycle to high ammonious levels are effectively prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "Ammonaps was approved in" "" "extraordinary circumstances" "", "as due to the rarity of the disease at the time of approval only limited information on this medicine." ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indexed with all patients, in which a complete hiding organ has already manifested in the newborn age (within the first 28 Lebenstage).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a belated form (inadequate Enzympic), who manifests itself after the first life of life) there is an indication for the use when in the anamnese is a hyperammonic encephalopathy.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are not able to swallow tablets or for patients with looting is AMARPS also available in granular form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dosage is calculated individually considering the tolerance and development of the daily protections of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="2817">The previous clinical experience is the normal daily dose of phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight of 20 kg as well as in growing and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">In patients who suffer from a timely lack of carbamyl phosphatesynthetase or ornithintranty bamylase, the substitution of Citrulline or Arginine in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3,8 g / m ² / day required.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with a Argininosuccinatsynthetase lack must be Arginine in a dosage of 0,4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8,8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMARPS tablets are not administered in patients with excavation, as a risk for the origin of Ösophagusulls, if the tablets are not immediately going into the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium polybutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMARPS should therefore be used in patients with congestive heart failure or serious kidney-heart failure as well as with sodium-tention and eco-formation of clinical conditions, only with caution.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Since metabolic and excretion of sodium lambutyrate over the liver and the kidneys, AMARPS should be used in patients with liver or kidney failure only with extreme caution.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The significance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known; the use of AMARPS during pregnancy is therefore contracted (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">At subcutaneous scale of phenylacetate to young rats (190 - 474 mg / kg) it came to a slowdown of neuronal multiplication and to an increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There also found a consuming maturation of cerebral synapses and a diminished number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and therefore a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be determined whether phenylacetate is indemoted in humans in the mother's milk, and for this reason is the use of AMARPS during the breastfeeding period (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trial with AMARPS, at 56% of patients came at least an undesirable event (AE) at 56% of these undesirable events, that they did not connect with AMARPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 10), frequent (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1.000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction at AMARPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by a 18 year old anoretical patient, which developed a metabolic encephalopathy in conjunction with Laktatazidis, peripherers, peripherie and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of overdose stood for a 5 month old smallholding with a different individual dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms go with the accumulation of phenylacetate which showed a dose of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day a dosislimit neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolic active connection that is congenital by acetylates with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine, which is exposed over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Stichiometric identifies phenylacetylglutamine with urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as alternative carriers for the excretion of surplus-reduced nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disorders of the urinary cycle can be accepted that for each gram it is produced sodium-phenylbutyrate between 0,12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine-nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is of importance that the diagnosis is completed at an early stage and the treatment is started to improve the survival chances and clinical results.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early manifolds form of the disease with appearance of the first symptoms in the newborn age was almost always infist, and the disease led even in treatment with peritonealdialysis or obese amino acids or with their stically-free analogy within the first lifetime of death.</seg>
<seg id="2838">Through hematalysis, the use of alternative ways of nitrogen hormone and sodium polyphenacetate), protrusted Cost and possibly substitution of essentials amino acids, it was possible to increase the survival rate of newborn in postpartal (however within the first life-month) of diagnostiled diseases on 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and the survival rate were treated 100%, but even with these patients there was time with many to spiritual disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a belated form of the disease (including female patients with heterozygous form of ornithintranty bambini recovered and afterwards permanently with sodium ylbutyrate and a protrudious diet were treated, was the survival rate 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficits are also hardly reversibly and in treating some patients may occur further deterioration of neurological condition.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrate is oxidized to phenylacetate, which is condensed in liver and kidney enzymatic with glutamine, with phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrat and its metabolic acid at plasma and Urin were determined according to Gabe of a single dose of 5 g sodium-buttobutyrate in sober-cycle and with liver cirrhosis for single handover as well as repetitive gifts from up to 20 g / day (non-controlled studies).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrate and its metabolic disorders also were also examined in cancer patients by sodium and phenylbutyrate (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After a oral subdose of 5 g sodium and phenylbutyrate in tablet form, 15 minutes after taking measurable plasma-centrations of phenylbutyrate.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with uric cycles or hemogloopia, according to various doses of phenylbutyrate (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) in the next morning after night-time fasting is not a phenylacetate at Plasma.</seg>
<seg id="2847">With three of six patients with liver cirrhosis, which were repeated with sodium ylbutyrate (20 g / day orally in three single pants), the middle phenylacetate concentration on the third day five times higher than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Extraction The medication is used within 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100% in the form of conjugifted product phenylacetylglutamine over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the results of the Micronucleus tests had sodium-phenylbutyrat with toxic and non-toxic doses treatable effects (investigation 24 and 48 h according to oraler administration of a single dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMARPS Granules will be taken either oral (infants and children who are not able to swallow, or patients with loaf disorders) or via a gastrodentures, or a nosonde.</seg>
<seg id="2851">The previous clinical experience is the normal daily dose of phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with newborn, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight of 20 kg as well as in growing and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essentials amino acids (especially pervastous amino acids), carnitine and serum proteins in plasma should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">In patients who suffer from a timely lack of carbamyl phosphatesynthetase or ornithintranty bamylase, the substitution of Citrulline or Arginine in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3,8 g / m ² / day required.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMARPS Granules contains 124 mg (5.4 mmol) sodium per gram sodium polyylbutyrate, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium polybutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>

<seg id="2858">On the basis of investigations on the excretion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disorders of the urinary cycle can be assumed that for each gram, it is produced from 0,12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine-nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Already existing neurological deficits are also not reversible for treatment and some patients may occur further deterioration of neurological condition.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is used to treat adult patients with "akuten cork" (ACS, decreased blood zures to the heart), for instance at instabiler Angina (a form of pain in the chest with different strength) or myocardinary (heart attack) without "ST- Heber" (a decent measuring rate at electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If Angiox to prevent bloodstream in patients used to undergo a PCI, a higher dose is administered and the infusion can proceed up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can contribute to patients with Angina or heart attack on the maintenance of blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Approximate 14 000 patients took part in the main study on the treatment of ACS-IIIa-IIb / IIIa-Inhibitor (GPI, a different medicine to prevent blood cells) with the conventional combination treatment with heretine (another anti-oxidant) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI was often a stent (a short tubes that remains in the arteries to prevent a clasp), and they also got other medicines for preventing blood cells, such as abcient and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">For the treatment of ACS, Angiox - with or without gift of GPI - in the prevention of new events (deaths, heart accidents or revascularization) after 30 days or one year, just as effective as traditional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients who underwent up a PCI, Angiox in relation to all indicators is just as effective as hoetine, except in severe bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox may not be used in patients who may possibly persensitive (allergic) against bivalirudine, other brain or one of the other ingredients.</seg>

<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of angiotox in patients with a PCI consists of a initiating intravenous weight of 0.75 mg / kg of body weight and one of them directly subsequent intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg of body weight / h at least for the duration of the operation.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of a alleviate Bolus by Angiox was not tested and is not recommended, even though a short PCI procedure is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">This value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to under 225 seconds, should be a second mencore of 0,3 mg / kg / body weight.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to decrease the appearance of low ACT values, the constitutional and diluted medicines should be carefully mixed and the Bolusdosis should be observed rapidly.</seg>

<seg id="2915">Both light and heavy blood fluctuations occurred under Bivalirudin alone than in the groups of Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa-Inhibitor and Bivalidrudin plus GPIIb / IIIa- Inhibitor (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An ACUITY heavy blood circulation has been defined as one of the following events: infirsthesis, intraocular bleeding or bleeding of ≥ 4 g / dl without bliteration blood-level of ≥ 3 g / dl of known blood circulation, reoperation due to a bleeding, application of blood products for transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Further, less frequently watched blood location, which appeared at more than 0.1% (occasionally), were "other" point, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose or neck.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following information on side effects are based on the data of a clinical study with Bivalirudin at 6000 patients who undergo a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Both in the Bivalirudin group as well as in the comparative approach, it came with women as well as in patients over 65 years more often than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both light and heavy bleeding occurred among bivalgeudin significant less frequently than in the comparative group under Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa-Inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects that are not listed above were reported after extensive application in practice and are summarized according to system organs in table 6.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In case of overdose the treatment with bivalgeudine is immediately breaking and the patient engulously monitored with regard to signs of a bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains Bivalirudin, a direct and specific Thrombininhibitor, which is located at the catalytic center as well as at the Aniston-setting region of Thrombin binds, irrespective of whether thotmbine is tied in the liquid phase or to a straight edge.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The bond between Bivalirudin an Thrombin, and with it its effect, is reversible because Thrombin will turn off the bond of bivalirudine-Arg3-Pro4 slowly, making the function of the active centre of Thrombin regenerates.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, by Bivalgeudin with Serum of patients in which it has come into the past of the saving-inductive Thrombal syndrome (HIT / HITTS), no thrombal agonizing reaction induce.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children from six years with diabetes that need treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is subcutaneous (under the skin) into the stomach wall, the upper thigh or the upper arm injected or as permanent infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin for the regulator of the Glucosity (sugar) produced in the blood or that insulin can not apply effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insistinglulisin differs very slightly from Humaninsulin, and the changes means that it works faster and a shorter ear-term is more effective than a short-effective human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was used in its application in combination with a long-effective insulin in patients with type-1 diabetes that can produce no insulin, in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study involving 572 children aged between 4 and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In case of type 2 diabetes, in which the body insulin can not be effective, Apidra was examined in a study involving 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indikator for the efficacy was the change of concentration of substance glycosylized hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study with adults with type-1 diabetes, after six months, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) compared to a lowering of 0.14% at Insulinlispro.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, the reduction of the HbA1c level is equivalent to the HbA1c-concentration after six months with Apidra compared to 0,30% with humanic normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra must not be used in patients who may possibly have hypersensitive (allergic) against insulullulisin or any of the other ingredients, or in patients suffering from a hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra must possibly be customized if it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can impact on the blood-glucosity level.</seg>
<seg id="2976">September 2004, the European Commission shared the company Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH has been a permit for the integration of Apidra in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is considered substantial as subcutaneous injecting either in the field of panloth, of the waiter, or of the deltox or subcutaneous through continuous flow infusion into the area of pancrews.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the reduced Gluconeogenesis-capacity and the diminished inverter, the Insulinrequires in patients with a limitation of the liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of the work force, the brand (floating), the Insulintyps (normal, NPH, zinc-delayed, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the manufacturing method can draw a change in the inappropriate order.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 A insufficient dosage or aboutbreak of a treatment, especially in patients with an insulin-tax diabetes, can lead to a hyperglycaemia and a diabetic ketoaziergosis; these states are potentially vital to life threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The changeover of a patient to another insistor or insulin of another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and can make a change of dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The timing of a hypoglycaemia depends on the ingredient of the used Insuline and can therefore change during the change of the treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2983">Among the substances that increase blood circulation and increase inclination to hypoglycemic substances, oropotensin-Converting-enzymm (ACE) -Hemmer, Fluoxetine, Fooxetyllin, Propoxyphen, Salizylates and Sulfonamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, under the effect of sympathedics such as Betablockers, Clonidin, Guanethidin and Reserpin the symptoms of the adrenergen counterparty.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experimentation studies for the reproductive-repairment showed no differences between Insu- linglulin and Humaninsulin in relation to pregnancy, the embryonic development, the birth or the postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether Insulanlulence enters into the human mother's milk, but in general insulin occurs neither in the mother's milk, nor is it resorted to orally application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">In the following are those of clinical trials are listed, grouped according to system organs and sorted according to decreasing prevalence (very often: ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; rare: ≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000); not known (incidence on the basis of availability).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Colt, cold and fass skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiety, unusual creation, creation, humiliation, hyolishness, headaches, headaches, nausea, nausea, nausea and heartbeat.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy is foaming, the injecting location within the injecting range continuously change, can occur in the sequence a lipodystrophy to the injection station.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycaics with unconsciousness can be given by an intra-muscular or subcutaneous injecting from glucco (0,5 to 1 mg), which is given by a correspondged person, or treated by intravenous gifts of glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">According to a glucinist, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the Ur- cause of the severe hypoglycaemia and avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin lowers the blood sugar levels by the stimulation of the peripheral glucose (especially through skeletal muscles and fat), as well as by the imitation of glucosine production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at subkutans Ga- be done faster and the active duration is shorter than at hu- manem Normalinsulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study with 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type-1 diabetes, Tus showed an inulate relevant dosing range of 0.075 up to 0.15 E / kg a disproportionate effect, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a disproportionate effect of glucosal effect, just like Humaninsulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">In addition, insistinglulisin has an twice as fast way as normal Humaninsulin and scored the full glucosal effect about 2 hours earlier than Humaninsulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">The data was clearly visible that in an application of insulululsiisin 2 minutes before the meal is reached a comparable postpranial glycemic control as is given in a humanic normal insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">If Insulullulisin 2 minutes before the meal, was achieved a better postprandiale control than with humanic normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If Insulullulisin 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal - turns, a comparable glycaemic control as was given in human genmalinsulin, which is given 2 Mi- Nutes prior to meal (see Figure 1), reaches.</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulullulisin at Gabe 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before the beginning of the meal, compared to humanitarian standards, which was 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 mins) before the start of the meal (figure 1A) as well as compared to humanitarian standards, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (figure 1B).</seg>
