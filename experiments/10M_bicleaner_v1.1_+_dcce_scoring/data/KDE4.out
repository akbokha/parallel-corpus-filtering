to use the crash module , click on the section . then you can view the page , the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; for the crash , or the list of the cr@@ ashes , if available , deleted .
the module Panel filter ( also called Fol@@ der filter ) can be accessed in the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under the extras filter . with the module , you can filter and Kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s up @-@ to @-@ date working directory on different kind of filter .
to use the DO@@ M @-@ buil@@ ders in the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; select extras DO@@ M tree tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the current document . as default , the display begins with the root kn@@ ots of the document , example : docum@@ ent@@ element , all other no@@ des are sub@@ elements of this root @-@ not@@ ation .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; represents another view of objects with the MI@@ ME type in@@ corporation / directory in local files . it can be used as an alternative for the various symbols and text screens so that you can view the content of your local file system .
the speci@@ ality of &amp; FS@@ View ; it consists of por@@ tra@@ ded folder hierarch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called Tree @-@ Map . each object is proportional to its size . this size must possess proportional to its size . this size must possess the property that the sum of sizes of the or@@ derly objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
at &amp; FS@@ View ; the size is the size of a file or a folder , whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries . in this way , large files can be easily recognized , even if they can be seen far down in the Ord@@ ina archy . accordingly , &amp; FS@@ View can be considered as a graphical and interactive version of the UNIX command command .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; it is an entry in the tre@@ ad @-@ presentation a rectang@@ le that represents a file or folder in your fil@@ es@@ ystem . to simplify navigation , the right edge can provide reasonable colour and damage settings .
the color of a rectang@@ le that is switched on display color mode , the depth can be set for the slight detection of the cas@@ ing depth or the representation of another file , such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type .
a rectang@@ le can be lab@@ eled with the various properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each property , you can specify if there is enough space for representation , or whether the area of subordin@@ ates can be used ( although per@@ mitting error by constraints on signs of the loyalty ) . in addition , you can specify the relative position of marking in the rectang@@ le .
when working algorithms for Tre@@ em@@ aps should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . at the Tre@@ aties in &amp; FS@@ View ; this goal is not always comp@@ elled to represent the ne@@ sting entries of the entries , and this frame will no longer be available . note that less space is lost for the frame when the rectang@@ le is quad@@ r@@ atic .
as division of the surface of an entry for the subordin@@ ate items will be eff@@ ected . here it is necessary for the testing and prevention of space @-@ lu@@ sts by frame always beneficial the surfaces are emerging , which are as quad@@ r@@ atic . the best methods of this are rows , columns or rec@@ orders .
you can specify the minimum presented area for an entry over the menu entry view . instead , a smoking pattern is drawn into the surface of the higher amount , to indicate that this area is actually occupied by an or@@ derly entry .
originally &amp; FS@@ View was intended as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets developed for the use of KC@@ ach@@ egr@@ ind .
the module image gallery can be found in the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu with the extras picture gallery ... or with C@@ trl ; I .

&amp; digi@@ came ; contains a fast image processing with basic editing tools . you can use this to assess your photos , comment and correct . the processing capabilities can be easily expanded with KDE image plugins Interface ( manual ) modules .
although &amp; digi@@ came , easy to use , it provides d@@ user @-@ used professional skills . it works fully in 16 @-@ bit color foam and all available modules support the raw converting by means of li@@ bra@@ w , DN@@ G export and ICC h@@ our@@ al workflow .
improved database with significantly more met@@ adata , such as &amp; eg ; over the camera or the lens to search for .
like everyone &amp; k@@ de ; programmes are also &amp; digi@@ tised ; an open source project . that means it &apos;s dependent on the support of the end user . therefore , you should notify me of problems and improvement .
&amp; digi@@ came ; try to make the det@@ ector of problems or suggestions as easy as possible for them . here , the help menu provides an entry problem or wishes .... This will open a dialog with a under@@ lined link . all required information is already registered here . follow the instructions to complete your report .
&amp; digi@@ came ; is a project that is supported by a community . that means that the user and developer can help each other . if you have a regular user of &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ation , then we would like to answer you questions to other users of &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ation . in this mail@@ ing@@ list , however , you should be all spoken of this language .
you can also visit the digi@@ tised ; homepage to learn news about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ came .
the best start to get to &amp; digi@@ came ; to participate , the registration in the developer &apos;s mailing list . guide to the log in in the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ came ; .
if you start &amp; digi@@ vor ; for the first time , you will be asked to specify your pictures and your database . you can simply specify a local , remote or remote folder . enter a folder name or click on the folder icon folder folder to select a folder .
in the second field you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data collection will be stored . this path remains the same for all image folders .
later you can so@@ ap as many folders like you want . &amp; digi@@ came ; will you use in addition as an Al@@ ben@@ library . settings digi@@ vert@@ eb@@ ral Coll@@ ections
if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top folder containing pictures as basic folders . &amp; digi@@ tization ; considers every sub@@ folder as an album . no picture is changed . during the search of the folder you will get a progress view like this :
&amp; digi@@ vor ; dur@@ ging recur@@ sive the libr@@ arian in all its depth . you can not include sub@@ folders unless it &apos;s i@@ ste in hidden folder . this can take you outside &amp; digi@@ tised , take a point before the name of the sub@@ folder .
if you take an existing folder containing photos as the basic folder , you will notice that the albums will take in M@@ eine Al@@ ben@@ list no photos as symbols . you can change the photo by taking a popular photo from the album and then use this on the folder symbol . you will find further details in the section albums .
once you have configured the basic folder , you can create in &amp; digi@@ tised ; your digital camera , then you should learn how to use M@@ eine &apos;s albums and m@@ ates key@@ word to manage your photos in the albums .
raw support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , so can &amp; digi@@ tization also . the support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the menu Help Tex@@ ture support .
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections of Ro@@ w @-@ Dec@@ o@@ der@@ ein@@ gs and Ro@@ h &apos;s work@@ flows .
an easy to use cam@@ Suit is provided to you , so that you can connect with your digital camera and your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ 2 . of course , every medium and each card reader , which is supported by your operating system , with &amp; digi@@ tised ; work together .
modern digital cameras are signed by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transfer . for the actual transmission to the machine , the camera will then be implemented as a record project ( P@@ TP ) and its deri@@ vatives . older cameras will be used under circumstances for connecting the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; digi@@ tization ; uses the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 to communicate with digital cameras , which a constantly increasing number of more than 800 cameras supported . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol , a far @-@ spread protocol , which is developed by the International Imaging Industry Association and other peri@@ ph@@ er@@ als without the need additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for your communication with the computer . da photos in general are large files and transmission via the serial port are slow , this connection has now turned out . &amp; digi@@ tised ; supports these cameras and leads the transmission of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 through . a complete list of supported cameras will be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ photograph@@ 2 has to be created with li@@ bex@@ if support , the ex@@ if support is provided by some lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 camera operators . if the ex@@ if support is not in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 . if the ex@@ if support is not possible in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 . if the ex@@ if support may not be noticed , or the generation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things in &amp; digi@@ came ; is how easy its functionality through modules can be extended :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the KDE Image plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common modular structure for &amp; digi@@ tising ; , K@@ Photo@@ album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . goal is to provide the modules to all video programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate pictures in virtually any way , as it can also be a user . your advantage is that it is much easier to complement &amp; digi@@ tization ; by writing a small module to complement an function than the changes in &amp; digi@@ tised ; even perform .
to simplify the window , you can either remove the page with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch in full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ trl + Shift + F .
editing and stretching of pictures works everywhere : you can place an image in another part of the tree , over the horizontal separ@@ ating line or in another application window . the only restriction is that a picture is not able to put into keywords , data sli@@ der or search .
- a file selection allows you to lift the spread @-@ wide selection : JPEG , PNG , TIFF , Ro@@ h , movies and audio
the Text@@ filter is used only for the fields that are currently displayed in the toolbar . thus , the fil@@ tering is shown on the fil@@ ename only when this ind it is displayed and displayed correctly . what fields are displayed can be displayed in the dialog box settings .
the view &amp; quot ; M@@ eine Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; represents a organized view of your photo al@@ ets . these albums are stored on your folder in which it was stored on the hard disk , according to the name of their collection in the properties properties or after the date , where the album was first created , sorted , the date can be changed in the properties of the album .
if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . choose to add a screen@@ shot directly to an album . select the album Im@@ porting screen@@ shot .
to copy or move a picture from one album to another , you can select the photo with the mouse on the target album and drop it there . in which then you may need to move the image through re@@ loc@@ ating or copying . you can easily copy all the photos and move it to the target album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the search features allowing you to enter information about this collection . to access the album , you need to edit the album with the right mouse button on the album and edit in the context menu directory .
Alb@@ um@@ - Kolle@@ g : are a method designed to mark your albums , so that you can select from a common name for the s@@ orting of your photos , or viewing albums sort by collection . if you want to add or delete new collections . if you want to add new collections or delete it , you can do it in the settings for collections .
the Alb@@ um@@ - Date : is used if you sort your albums by date by viewing albums sort by date .
the buttons For@@ t@@ ester , average , New Year : they set the date on the one of the oldest , the new image or the passage of the album . this will first attempt to calculate the average of the pictures from their EX@@ IF @-@ information . if this fails , instead , the date of last modification of each file used in this folder .
when you first came to an album in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ des ; the first picture is selected as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; M@@ eine Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; however , this will help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes , the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album icon , you need to click the image with the right mouse button , and in the context menu &amp; quot ; As Alb@@ um@@ vor@@ schau . you can also drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
an album can always be included in a collection and collections can not be wast@@ ed .
&amp; digi@@ came ; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the field of m@@ ash key@@ word left down in the main window . album collections have a different effect . they can always use all the photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
the image window provides you the main view of your photos . if you choose an album , all images are displayed in this album in the image window . each photo will be shown in a preview , you can adjust the size of this curtain with the two lou@@ pe buttons in the toolbar .
when you open an album the first time you &apos;ll just wait while the th@@ umb@@ nails will be generated . this allows you to re@@ use in which you can generate all the spect@@ ators in the menu extras .
information about each image will be displayed below the corresponding preview . what information you are , you can change about settings and adjust the area th@@ umb@@ nails your wishes .
the th@@ umb@@ nails will have hel@@ pers , which can rest . if you ho@@ ver the mouse po@@ inter for a moment to rest . the screen@@ shot shows the most important properties , including all the keywords of a photo . the screen@@ shot up in the section Intro@@ duction into the main window shows such an auxiliary character .
photos are all that comes to &amp; digi@@ tising . albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you . the image processing shows your photos and allows you to reach a number of improvements to them . you can easily reach the context menu of the preview or menu image in the menu bar . you can choose between the spect@@ acle of images , a slideshow or the processing of images .
you can open the image processing with a photo by using either F@@ 4 image editing ... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and Edit ... select a guide on how to edit your photos . with the image processing , you can view your photos and change it .
it may happen that &amp; digi@@ tised , the functionality which you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by opening the context menu with the right mouse button , and how you adjust it to your needs , you will find information in &amp; k@@ de ; manual .
you should note that after processing through other image editing programs can occur with the pictures included in the image . some programs do not save this data with the changing image . thus , this information is lost from the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , bl@@ ending , etc .
&amp; digi@@ came ; put two ways of fil@@ ming . the sim@@ pl@@ est is to select it with the right mouse button on the th@@ umb@@ nail and choose dirt . in the sub @-@ menu you can specify the level of rotation .
to change the fil@@ ename of a photo , you can click with the right mouse button on the th@@ umb@@ nail and select F2 ren@@ aming from the context menu . note that you maintain the extension ( .jpg , ges@@ ystem@@ .tif , &amp; etc . ) .
if you came a photo from &amp; digi@@ tised , it will be del@@ ayed into the du@@ st@@ bin of &amp; k@@ de ; shi@@ fted . F@@ 8 Photo Del@@ ete or Ent@@ f Falls you prefer to really delete , you can use this by stopping .
the view &amp; quot ; M@@ eine Dat@@ um@@ sli@@ ste@@ quot ; organize your photos from the data . &amp; digi@@ came ; used for this either the EX@@ IF date or if this is not available , the date of last modification of the file .
if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the dating back in the dates below to show you only the photos of the selected days .
photos with keywords provide a flexible and powerful way to organize your photos and cat@@ alog@@ ous . keywords are stickers that can be assigned to individual photos or whole groups . once a key@@ word has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this key@@ word or search .
if a key@@ word is selected , all photos , which were marked with this key@@ word .
tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to organise your keywords and quot ; M@@ eine Stich@@ wor@@ t@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; together , so you are the keywords which you &apos;re looking for , easily find .
the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and s@@ ni@@ fied key@@ word in the IP@@ TC datashe@@ ets of the picture , at least for JPEG , and so you can also convert your keywords in other programs as soon as &amp; digi@@ tised , the pictures have noticed .
you can add new keywords by using the right mouse button either on &amp; quot ; for a key@@ word , and then select new key@@ word , after you click on a existing key@@ word , this becomes a key@@ word for that key@@ word .
you can delete a key@@ word by clicking the key@@ word with the right mouse button and delete . if you delete a key@@ word , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the key@@ word is removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a key@@ word by pressing it to the desired position in the tree and draw down there . then a menu that gives you the option to slide the key@@ word . a key@@ word can be at a time only once in the tree .
you can edit the properties of a key@@ word by clicking it with the right mouse button and click in the context menu key@@ word . you can change the name of the sample and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; M@@ eine Stich@@ wor@@ te@@ quot ; alter .
to select another photo as an album icon , you need to click the image with the right mouse button and select in the context menu as Alb@@ um@@ vor@@ schau . additionally you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
to use &amp; digi@@ vor ; s functionality with keywords , you must first have done your photos with keywords , you can click on the appropriate key@@ word in the tree &amp; quot ; M@@ eine Stich@@ wor@@ quot ; drag and lay down there . alternatively , you can also select it with the right mouse button on the preview of the pictures and select from the context menu key@@ word .
you can provide a photo with any number of tags . the photo is shown as soon as you choose one of the keywords paid for each person in a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event , where it was made etc .
once you have given a photo with keywords , this will appear under the preview of the image in the main window .
you can remove a key@@ word in which you open the context menu of the photo and select from the keywords menu . the menu shows you only the keywords which were assigned to the photo .
the tim@@ eline view shows a tempor@@ al adjustment of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be moved via this hist@@ ogra@@ m . to choose a time frame , you only have to click on the lower rectang@@ le of the selection frame , which indicates the time unit . thus all related images are displayed in the main window .
in the field below you can enter a title and save your selection . it will then be displayed in the list below .
include all elements of the database : names , reviews , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , dates and in the future even more .
Neb@@ ul@@ er Search box is a small lamp the green is found when the search hits . if you click here , the fil@@ tering will be deleted and all pictures again displayed . if the search has nothing found , then the lamp is red .
the most advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side@@ bar with the bin@@ oc@@ ulars . if you can open this search here however as live search , which always contains the fil@@ tering what you entered as a search criterion . after you saved it was recorded as a search engine he filter at the list .
if you are happy with your selection , push the head OK and the search will be performed . the text field will be displayed in a search list . if you choose to select a name in my search list , you only need to select the corresponding entry from the view of the search list and select an option in his context menu .

if you want to delete a existing search from the list , select in the context menu search .
the Advanced search presents you an expan@@ sive search form with many search parameters , with which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ tization ; s database .
the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Alb@@ end@@ aten@@ bank@@ note . an option can be deleted from this list with search group . each option can link with other over the logical operations All ... , A ... , none ... or at least ... we can link Su@@ chen of the Typ@@ s &amp; quot ; AND NI@@ CH@@ T@@ quot ;
&amp; digi@@ tised ; character@@ izes each image by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows you to compare these sig@@ nat@@ ures . the less the difference between two image nat@@ ures , the more correspond to it . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is an area where you can drop each image . by means of a spon@@ ell@@ erts , the results are increased or decreased . if you slide a picture of somewhere about the symbol of the un@@ accurate search in the left page row , then you will open it and you can drop it there .
sketch : free hand @-@ colour sketch : draw a fast sk@@ et@@ ches and &amp; digi@@ tised , finds the matching pictures . also here you can get a sw@@ elling value .
this rider provides an intui@@ tively plug @-@ tool based on the Mar@@ ble plug @-@ program . you can press with the mouse wheel or bending it . press C@@ trl ; lin@@ ker mouse button to draw a square . all pictures within this coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . of course , that requires your photos Geo @-@ data contain .
in the field below you can specify a name for your Geo @-@ filter . this will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a live ge@@ om@@ folder .
&amp; digi@@ came ; represents a lumin@@ ous in a separate window available with which you can easily compare pictures . he works with all supported image files , also raw files , together .
select one or more pictures from any View in the main window and then use C@@ trl ; L D@@ em lumin@@ ous add from the context menu . the selection will be added to the lumin@@ ous menu and open its window . if you are back in &amp; digi@@ ous , main window will be opened , you can open the lumin@@ tically fast with L extras .
from the th@@ umb@@ bell bar you can compare the images that you want to compare in the left or right area of the window . if you can preview the pictures from the toolbar and perform the zoo or adju@@ sting operations on one of the pictures , then they will also compare the same area of the two pictures .
another mode is better suited to print quickly from a picture series . if you are using p@@ air@@ wise navigate from the toolbar , then view the left mouse button on any preview picture . the right neigh@@ bou@@ red image will be displayed in the right area . this simpli@@ fies it to be performed by a number of similar pictures .
of course , the normal sol@@ der action also work directly from the lumin@@ ous as e.g. F@@ 4 file be@@ ers ....
all imaging information from the right side@@ bar of the main window are available for both pre@@ ach@@ ers in the light . this makes it e.g. simple visual differences with exposure data .
at the bottom of each area you will find a built @-@ in pi@@ voting function , which you can see on the crossed paths . to hold the visible area of the image , you need to click on it and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; pressing both images will then display the same image .
the zo@@ om@@ es works just as in other views . just use the zoom regul@@ ator under the images or C@@ trl . mouse wheel to see in the picture in and out to zo@@ oming . this happens in both images when you &apos;re the Pre@@ view Pre@@ view .
what is a digital survey - apart from the fashion word ? digital survey considers every part of the process that followed up to the final output and the permanent storage . each of the photos took up , sc@@ ans or digital photos saves a form of digital survey . most of us do not make this in a systematic and efficient way .
we will give you a tool , a plan and practical tips as you can backup your pictures , you can backup and photos back again . we consider the downloading , remove , re@@ tire , re@@ group@@ ing , archiving , wait and export of image files .
&amp; quot ; Digit@@ ale survey takes on , indigenous , categori@@ zed , sec@@ ures , transformed , transform@@ ers , pre@@ fabric@@ ated and exported content that have a mon@@ ary or cultural value . quot ;
met@@ adata are defined as data about data . met@@ adata are defined in accordance with your definition data , which will provide information on or provide documentation of other data provided by an application or environment .
I d@@ are to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you need not even know how many photos you have , then you don &apos;t even need to save the met@@ adata both in a database and in the image files , so that you can access a fast search and a secure archiving to which you can access with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you do and need to know anything to fit into your system is the establishment of information structure in contrast to the data structure . you must decide whether others want to have access to your photos or on a network drive &amp; etc . note that you have to switch to a larger drive sometime .
maybe you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can quickly be found throughout your dates . if you make enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folders like &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; use . export is a folder of images to print or publish on a website .
professional photograph@@ ers have different requirements such as sealing of photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant supply of pictures on different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years there will be 95 % archives and 5 % working files and you will then not re@@ build your structure for this content .
which types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the st@@ acker processing sim@@ pler . separate new of old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you &apos;re looking for an original or a derived image .
we also recommend the met@@ adata option to store met@@ adata in the introduction of met@@ adata in &amp; digi@@ tization . this makes sure that Ex@@ if@@ - and IP@@ TC data can be stored into the file by selecting the met@@ adata from the database into the files by selecting the appropriate item on the menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens when you want to change ? this includes a met@@ adata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones .
now the real work begins , as you now need to apply any keywords , cap@@ tions and review . of course you can select all the images that need the same attri@@ bute and then put the value . you start the best with the rating or the rank . this makes sense , since you can concentrate on the best photos .
let &apos;s now let ourselves with keywords , keywords , as you are often called for other programs , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
if you import cat@@ alo@@ zed images from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; digi@@ tised , automatically insert the tree for you b@@ z@@ w the pictures to the right place . the changed keywords are done by &amp; digi@@ ms ; updated during it the sub@@ trees are persec@@ uted .
the graphic shows how different met@@ adata are over@@ cut . this is a very cru@@ de representation , since each block of met@@ adata in truth consists of many sections . fil@@ ename and calendar data are characteristics of all images .
enough the keywords - the next section refers to damages or comments , the third important tool to catalog your met@@ adata .
you don &apos;t want to let your photos just see your photos just let them share with your friends , your family , other photograph@@ ers and agencies . they are certainly interested in getting your photos arrive .
take a look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it closer , you start to see some details , people , the place .
and now I tell you this one of the Al@@ de@@ field of Al@@ lied &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y . Wow ! you start to dream , associations , the historical time span is re@@ present , you might even hear the silence . so the dam@@ aging has changed your perception of this panorama .
for others who consider your photos , the title may be more important than the picture itself to generate an interest . if you show images you should tell a story . remember that the key is the meaning to the viewer to help Him through the mot@@ if you have moved to understand what you understand .
it is fine when a picture is not perfect when it has the strength to work only with an ins@@ cription for itself alone .
with &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ation , you can export as much text , at an internation@@ alised alpha@@ bet ( U@@ TF @-@ 8 ) , when you use your images in Web @-@ galleries , then these signs may be exported to your preferences in the labelling and / or the title of the web @-@ gallery system . you do not have to tell the story for the op@@ ener .
do you remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find into a different city without navigation system ? it was not a te@@ di@@ ous planet in Goo@@ g@@ le@@ Earth ? well , because with images the train of the sp@@ atial presentation now already starts with light speed .
the possibilities to explo@@ iting the Geol@@ ocation are already inn@@ is@@ able and will be able to repeat itself in the future , you can also export your travels via pictures with geographic data . &amp; digi@@ tization also , the photos can also export you to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flick@@ r &amp; etc . with the Goo@@ g@@ le@@ Maps viewer .
&amp; quot ; Copy@@ left is a voc@@ abulary with copyright and den@@ otes the copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same freedoms are also valid in all modified versions , so also for the work of others .
the following description tells you the information in the home page of &amp; digi@@ came ; as information depos@@ ited :
the author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should add your name , or the name of the person who has created the photo . if it is not desired , the name of the photographer can be used , then the name of a company or organization has been stored . this field does not support comm@@ as nor sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ator .
author title ( syn@@ onym for cap@@ itals ) : associated with the author . this field contains the working design@@ ation of the photographer . examples of this can be titles as : employee , freelance photographer or independent photographer . as this is a comment on the car field , this field has to be filled out .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the provider , to identify who you are . this does not necessarily have the author . if the photographer can be listed here , then you can find the picture to others . if the picture is a bearing photo , then the group / agency will provide the image here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although this is no longer a protection against abuse . everyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computer can delete or modify the solution for this problem are digital water@@ mark . for individuals , this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and half @-@ pro@@ s this protection is very important for it .
the digital water@@ mark is unique each image unique . &amp; digi@@ came ; in the near future , such a module can be used for st@@ acking processing .
topics : PLAT@@ TEN@@ FE@@ H@@ LER , record loss , ECC , transmission errors , ag@@ eing of storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , lifestyle , temperature , data size , widespread su@@ pers@@ ti@@ tions
of course , we are not talking about CDs that were lost on the street or a fire . these kind of loss are the same that can also be done with traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section it is possible to solve problems with the new media .
K@@ roll On@@ track , the biggest data recovery company in the world , has some interesting statistics , which has a loss of data .
to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs must be treated cau@@ tious and you can no longer stay longer than a couple of years . of course , you can also buy CDs and DVDs in food quality . there are offers on gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollars ; 2 people who claim a lifetime of 100 years for themselves . whether you believe it is in your brass room .
CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ readable , but you can use this risk in which you use good Dis@@ ks and good recording guarantee and they are not much more costly than the cheapest but you write much more reliable , so you write the right choice .
CDs and DVDs are very sus@@ cep@@ tible to faul@@ ts , even if you have just written only effective data , the rest we needed for the form@@ atting and the control sum@@ ming . despite this massive protection , it is required by chemical aging , ul@@ tra@@ violet light , dust and etc .
for def@@ ective CDs and DVDs there is a favorable program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster which apparently causes mir@@ acles in CDs and DVDs . it also does not work for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications that damaged data from damaged flo@@ pp@@ ies , hard disks , fl@@ ash@@ media , USB drives , etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to win the formats against the HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disk can store 50 GB and thus almost six@@ teen the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8,5 GB . everything that has been said to CDs and DVDs also applies for the Blu @-@ ray disk .
then burn slowly with a good recording guarantee on high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ etary format . if you need to store the media with a description , date &amp; author , and afterwards on animals protected site . do not forget to transfer the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read this media .
Disk@@ manufacturers keep your statistics for itself . your manufacturer guarantees a new disk , but not the data . Google produces on this subject a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard disks : dis@@ inf@@ alli@@ zation
shortly : disco@@ vers keep on the longest if you are operated in the temper@@ ament range of 35 ° C up to 45 ° C . in lower temper@@ ament , the most common error matter , S@@ MAR@@ T can not notice this error . some of S@@ MAR@@ T identified errors . these are in particular readers and publisher loads . the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years .
this is only the complete disp@@ at@@ est due to over voltage . of course you can also have data loss due to an electric if you have secured the files , but this losses can normally be produced without any major problems .
while most electrical devices does not hide much power , that can result in devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed key@@ boards , complete data loss , hard@@ ships , hard@@ boards , destruc@@ tive mother@@ boards and other def@@ ective . protect yourself from the un@@ avo@@ idable that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most widespread protection against black@@ tips is a trans@@ verse protection . this is a device that some of the energy heat absorbed and the rest gro@@ unded . it &apos;s usually available in the form of a plug @-@ in . do not think any plug @-@ in is also included .
if you are looking for an over@@ time protection , then you should pay attention to the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also consider that it provides protection against fl@@ ashes and thus protects the properly connected devices .
since you can use over voltage of any cable to your computer , you should consider that also all peri@@ ph@@ er@@ als connected to your system are also protected . some manufacturers put over voltage sim@@ ulator and also contain a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection possibilities for the co@@ axial cable of cable @-@ mo@@ dem@@ s and TV card .
if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ load protection . a variety of these devices are specially developed for not@@ ebooks and therefore contain very small and you also contain the protection for the modem . so you are ideal for travel .
while an over@@ flight protection your system protects from smaller oscill@@ ations in the power lines , it will not really help you during a complete waste . even an failure of a few seconds may result in loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in a breaking @-@ free power supply .
in addition to the protection against over@@ vol@@ tages , these devices can be automatically available cordless energy when a black@@ out occurs . if you buy a US@@ V , you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as an over@@ load protection . in addition , the life time of the battery and the combined software is interesting .
concerns the potential risk that your computer system is exposed and and compare his safety in power problems with the cost of avoiding this . a high quality over@@ voltage range can be you up to &amp; euro ; 40 . this is just a small prize sli@@ ce if you think how well your computer is protected . at the end you should remember all cable before you go to the holidays .
the Amazon Web @-@ Service includes S3 storage service - a simple memory service . with the right configuration , you can use this as drive under &amp; Linux ; Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as a backup destination for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is another popular offer to store any amount of data .
they are at home compared to the hard disks , although very expensive - 40 GB costs &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollars ; 500 . in addition , you must send the data to the compar@@ atively slow Internet .
the solutions are therefore suitable only as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general locking solution . for this , it is too slow .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flick@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo @-@ Community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com make online store services available to photos . their free space provides you more at full resolution online . the professional variant provides you more available , in case of Flick@@ r dramatic more . for 25 $ a year you get unlimited memory , which should be checked in reality .
from the point of view of data security , the web solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically regulated thanks to the TCP protocol and with the large firms are included in the offer a backup and a distributor memory . thus they are des@@ ast@@ er@@ ate .
the diagram illustr@@ ates the elements of the transmission chain in calcul@@ ator . all transmission errors are pr@@ one to transmission errors . the file system Z@@ FS and b@@ ust represent at least the data integr@@ ity between operating system and hard drive safely .
the worst thing is that you did not say if this is happening in your hardware . all these disorders can stay un@@ detected until you have no protection in your computer . no one seems to have thought of it . no one seems to have thought of it . the internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than that in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supply are another source of transmission loss since it generate interference within the data currents . under normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are currently not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look to the future . already 2010 you will see thousands of bugs per year .
Z@@ FS of Sun Mic@@ ros@@ ystems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle lower faul@@ ts at low level . it &apos;s open source , with many patents and is available under one to the GPL in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it will soon also be available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available .
Oracle has launched its own initiative with its b@@ lower fil@@ es@@ ystem . this is still in the Alpha status . it uses the same prot@@ ections of the Z@@ FS and is also available for &amp; Linux ; it is still not part of the kernel .
under@@ estimate this not ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss in the not@@ ebook and 46 % at the workplace systems . not@@ ebooks are already the proportion of the theft of 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most of viruses . it leads to a lower damage , than for example against theft or re@@ installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; it has been no longer seen anymore .
Open Source file systems are less sus@@ cep@@ tible to data loss as propri@@ etary systems : false , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the spread file systems . you can find a very good English article here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent cor@@ rupt data and data loss : false , only the speed of the investigation process at a su@@ dden inter@@ ruption during an operation is higher and an un@@ defin@@ able status will be avoided before the problem appeared , it is lost .
viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : false , theft and human errors are the root causes of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings from fundamental physical limitations . community is that while the technology is further developed there is a natural fron@@ tier for this progress . sensitivity and smo@@ ky @-@ characteristic for all types of light sensors are far from that border no longer far away .
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 meg@@ ap@@ i@@ x@@ el@@ ic sensors . even if this resolution is already too high for comp@@ uting cameras and high quality optics are the optimum for compact cameras . even DSLR cameras have your border with 10 @-@ 12 Meg@@ ap@@ i@@ xel . for higher resolutions , you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
an 750@@ GB disk drive you ton@@ ight for 100 &amp; euro . so do not make anyone else responsible for the data loss . so please backup your data frequently according to a plan and test this backup before you create anything like the re@@ install of your operating system , the exchange of plates or the size change of hard disk drives .
suppose you make your back@@ ups on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a flash suggests you are lucky when the drive was not connected in the moment .
a disaster defe@@ ats locally to and destroy a lot . forget aircraft : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous for your data . they normally affect an entire room or the complete house .
therefore , Des@@ aster does not always mean any local storage . bring your back@@ ups the stairs up to the neighbour &apos;s house , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as above mentioned is a common reason for a data loss despite securing the panic . if you have a backup , which is not immediately available , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all the files is to be backed up . it is a snapshot of a snapshot without a history and represents a complete copy at a time of time .
difference insurance : a backup of the files have been altered since the last complete backup . created a complete snapshot of two points : the complete backup and the final analysis of the process .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files changed since the last backup has been changed . you can restore the original status at any time . this backup comes from a sealed system at the next with the exception that it is just rep@@ ast@@ ed and not continuously .
r@@ sync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily create on your machines . in contrast to script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file @-@ controlled scripts , r@@ sync only the difference of files that were really changed . this will be com@@ pressed and if you want to increase security via s@@ sh .
backup important images directly after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or other optical medium .
this procedure can give you enough time to un@@ cover loss and restore . at the same time you come back for backup but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of work files . in the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot should be done manually , after which you have made a complete check .
themes : met@@ adata , stored in the image file stored IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , original , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ locate images and met@@ adata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , ... , use of the internet .
so that valuable images will survive the next 40 years that is about the time span in which you really are interested in you because they should remember your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be observed :
since the future due to your nature is un@@ predic@@ table you must look at all what today is said with caution . unfortunately , there is no other way than to make some vig@@ il@@ ance while the current system are backward . the less variants you have used in the past , so that is easier to assess the questions of the future .
this issue should actually be answered from the explanations in this document . use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtu@@ alization is nowadays available for anyone . so if you have an old system , you keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and visual technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the expert set for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means to enlarge .
sometimes we assume that you have planned the scal@@ ability and set the area you want to enlarge a dedicated top or partition . at * nix Systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and store it on a new record :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g , whether your new record was realized by the system , but do not hang it on .
&amp; Dollar ; dd if = / dev / s@@ db / S@@ dc # source is / dev / s@@ db , the new record is / dev / s@@ dc / dollar ; # works with ext@@ 2,3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and Reiser@@ FS . / dev / s@@ ad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of Reiser@@ FS if necessary
Open Source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day no software does not exist , then you can create it yourself . this task is easier by year to year sim@@ pler .
GIF is a propri@@ etary , pat@@ ented format that dis@@ appears slowly from the market . you should not use it anymore .
PNG is designed as an open source standard of GIF . it may be much more . it is dist@@ ressing , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC met@@ adata , but not as many as TIFF , but not as many as TIFF need and a slow @-@ expression . this format we would like to recommend you to store your images .
TIFF was widely used as a picture format . TIFF can be stored in un@@ com@@ pressed shape or in a container with a sliding @-@ free com@@ pression mode ( def@@ ect ) . however , a problem is however , that this format is adapted by many people . therefore , there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
DN@@ G The Digit@@ ale Neg@@ ative file format is a licensed free and open resource format that developed by Adobe Systems . DN@@ G was developed exclusively on the TIFF / EP format and fully committed to the use of met@@ adata . one hand@@ ful compan@@ ions sets DN@@ G already now and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon it at some time .
this may be one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology has been introduced to replace the &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a mark@@ er with extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
many photograph@@ ers draw it from an original of your recording , mostly in sli@@ pping image . X@@ MP does not fit through the image file , but it can be noted in problems with the link between the met@@ adata and the image file . therefore , you should think about whether you use DN@@ G as a container and put it all there together .
the Dublin Core Met@@ adata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online met@@ adata communities , which includes a large range of application and mod@@ elling , discussions and collabor@@ ative work in the D@@ C@@ MI communities and D@@ C@@ MI groups , annual conferences and workshops , basic connections and educational efforts to reach a far @-@ reaching acceptance of met@@ adata standards and practices .
import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the pictures are on the camera po@@ dium , you can use this as a temporary backup .
convert raw files to DN@@ G and save them in your archive archive . this function is not yet implemented .
for a refined editing you can use external programs . if you have the pictures again with &amp; digi@@ tised , then you should add the met@@ adata again . these were cut down from the other programs .
protect the edited paintings for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them then into web@@ galleries , coding in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc .
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ation . in the Ad@@ ding of a photo to an album you will find a description as you &apos;ve already installed on your hard drive . but the camera interface will give you many advanced settings to import@@ ing images to your Alb@@ end@@ aten@@ ate bank .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ tised , connect it to the display mode , connect the camera to the display mode to switch off and turn off . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , they try to connect with your camera . when the connection is made , a fer@@ ous view of all photos on the camera will appear . some cameras do not display a preview images . if this is the case , the file names are displayed and a symbol for file order for each file , photos , movies , music etc. on the camera .
before you download the photos on your computer , you might need any camera information about each entry . with the page features and met@@ adata from the camera interface you can see the properties of an entry or its met@@ adata .
this dialog displays file properties and photo@@ graphic information that can be stored internally from the camera . a symbol indicates that the picture has not been downloaded to your computer . note that in some digital cameras do not be available all the information .
the tab met@@ adata displays the internal met@@ adata , such as ex@@ if , manufacturer indicated , GPS etc. of the image . this information is the same as in the met@@ adata page from the main window of &amp; digi@@ tising ; or the picture processing . please note that these met@@ adata are not available at some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button Download and then download the selection from All . this invites you to download the photos and we recommend you check if the pictures were downloaded instantly in an album before you deleted the photos from the camera .
if you do not want to download all photos , you can only choose the desired using the standard optional methods from &amp; k@@ de ; select the item you download and then download the download page . the button below Download the button for download until you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , is an option New Download available . these pictures have not been downloaded by &amp; digi@@ tization . in this case , the new images are downloaded with a star at the fore@@ front row . if you choose this option , only the new pictures are downloaded .
if you want to download the buttons for download or download selected , appears in which the photos are stored . the list of existing albums will be sorted whenever normal folder is sorted , shown in Section M@@ eine &apos;s section . select the target album from the list and press OK .
after you selected the target album , click OK , and &amp; digi@@ tised ; loads the photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all of them at once , by selecting the button del@@ eting . if you just want to delete it and use them deleted .
note that there is no possibility to recover the photos you deleted from the camera ; so they will be completely deleted . so you should carefully review whether the photos are successfully deleted in a &amp; digi@@ ous ; however , you should delete it from the camera . if you want to delete it from camera , since this is much faster .
cameras use as fil@@ ename for the photos often do not be particularly meaningful again . the file names are usually deleted again after the photos from the camera will load . therefore , it can be useful to integrate the date and time on which the image was taken to integrate into the fil@@ ename .
in the next section you will find options for turning and sp@@ ies of the picture and for file @-@ based under@@ taking . if you use this last option automatically a folder a day will be created .
the options Dur@@ ing the transfer opens three more options that are performed before the photos on the disk . the first two concern the data on the author Standard Aut@@ ot@@ ty . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
if you wish to use a different file format than standard format , you can use e.g. in mach@@ ining fot@@ o- % Y@@ - % M@@ - % d % H : % M : % S . turn off the option Date &amp; time . for more adjustments you should read the help of the command str@@ f@@ time .
if you use the Camera fil@@ ename , you have the option to change the fil@@ ename in small letters lines . or in large letters , if you prefer this .
the new fil@@ ename , the &amp; digi@@ came ; for a photo used , below the name , the camera will be displayed in the preview . your settings to ren@@ ame will be stored and automatically used when you open the camera lens .
&amp; digi@@ came ; can use all the information about the orientation of the camera to a pun@@ ctu@@ ation recording . not all cameras present these information . in the section of page row met@@ adata , you can read further details about the information that your camera is embedded in the photo .
the automatic turn is usually turned on , and if your camera does not supply this information , leaves the photo in the original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic rotation , use the button hei@@ gh@@ ted and select the automatic rotation at the bottom of the window .
if your camera has been made about the date , where the photo was made , I can create &amp; digi@@ b ; this sub@@ verb@@ s will be loaded onto the image data . all pictures with the same date will be loaded into the same sub@@ album . not all cameras present this information . in the section side@@ bar Met@@ a @-@ Data you can read , which information can be embedded into the photos .
this option is normally off , and in this case save &amp; digi@@ tization ; the photos directly on target album . if you want to change this option . use the button below and select the option file @-@ based under@@ taking at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to load photos from their computer on their camera is the button Download . select then upload . choose the file sel@@ ector &amp; k@@ de ; appears in which you can select files up@@ loaded , you can also select more than one file with the default &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
once the images are settled , asks &amp; digi@@ tization ; you , where the images are loaded high . select a folder selection dialog for the camera . select the desired folder and click OK to start the upload . the images will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . it is a position that can be displayed in long@@ itude and lati@@ tude , and which can be displayed on a map . determining the data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian GL@@ ON@@ AS , the European Galileo or any other system .
not only for professional photograph@@ ers it may be interesting to link a picture with an precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to credit an area through automatic recording of GPS data . environmental plan@@ er , military , police , architecture offices and real estate mak@@ ler can use this ability .
if you &apos;ve forgotten later , where exactly the photo was made , you can post a browser which shows the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ation , users who want to locate the place of photos , or just want to document this aspect , it is well to provide position &apos;s position .
the question is how does the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that there are many GPS data fields such as the direction , saddle and ticket Reference . there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , via a re@@ processing of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic assignment .
as far as we know , there are currently no camera integrated with GPS unit . but there are a few who work with GPS recei@@ vers . either as card module or transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : co@@ y@@ Manu@@ als iP@@ A@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ dak D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR R@@ CS Pro G3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with g@@ p@@ sman or g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel . you must save this data in the g@@ px format , as this is the only format that is supported by the module for geographic assignment .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract data from pictures and by GPS . on the following page you can use the same under &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and lati@@ tude , or other data , then you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ if@@ tool of Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the precau@@ tionary coordinates , which are produced for example by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle .
map@@ s.@@ google.com will not show European street species . here are some European pages , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all the navigation details for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ came ; tries to give you so much control over his work processes as possible . in order to access these settings , you need to select Settings menu . you can switch between these settings ; you can switch between these settings by clicking on the symbols of the left @-@ hand side .
select action can be displayed on embedded screen preview or start editing . you place the standard behavior of &amp; digi@@ tised ; firm , if you click on an entry in the main view .

editors is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to provide the photo . this must not be the author , if this is registered for a message agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press . if the picture is a bearing photo , then the group or agency should provide the picture here .
the IP@@ TC @-@ actions store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC field . this is achieved that the met@@ adata are permanently contained in the image and not only entered into the database by &amp; digi@@ tising ; . these met@@ adata are also available to other programs and can be imported into &amp; digi@@ tization .
cap@@ tions described as embedded cap@@ tures ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images : this will sync the comments that you add to your photos , with the pictures embedded in pictures . this allows your compl@@ ain@@ ations also contain references , these are written by the recording &amp; digi@@ tions .
the site settings contains all options for the information that appear , when the mouse @-@ cursor in the main window above a file rests . depending on the chosen option this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ tised ; supports a number of different image formats and some video formats and audio formats . to specify which data types and digi@@ tising ; display , you can add the file extensions to this list and remove . each file in a &amp; digi@@ ner ; Alb@@ um@@ ord@@ ner , which does not have this extension , by &amp; digi@@ tised ; ignored .
the default settings can be reset again by pressing the button Ref@@ res@@ h right of each category .
the settings of the lumin@@ ous output of &amp; digi@@ tised ; can then be placed on this page . however , some pictures have enabled different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . however , the option &amp; quot ; In the whole image size lad@@ ders , you should only have access to rapid invo@@ ices . if you have one , then you can get better results results .
by default the image processing has a black background behind the indicated photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can switch the toolbar when you use the image editing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dar@@ ker or bri@@ ghter color in the picture . these colors will be set here . in the image processing , this approach can be mounted at F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Chro@@ ma Sub@@ sampling is meant that the images are co@@ ded in a higher resolution of lumin@@ ance than in color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for the immediate explanation .
with the setting PNG @-@ Com@@ pression you can reduce the size of PNG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality , as PNG need a hide @-@ free algorithm . the only effect is that the picture dates back more time to output and pack . if you have a rapid calcul@@ ator , you can set this value to a high com@@ pression . it means 1 : a low and 9 a high com@@ pression .
with the option TIFF @-@ files com@@ pressing you can switch the def@@ ender -@@ com@@ pres@@ sion@@ sal@@ g@@ .@@ mus for TIFF @-@ pictures . this reduces the size of the black images . it has no effect on image quality , since the defensive algorithm has not been working .
with the setting losses @-@ free JPEG @-@ 2000 files you can save lo@@ st@@ less . even if you have written the des@@ crip@@ tive setting , the relationship between quality loss and file size was far better than with normal JPEG . when this paragraph was not yet supported , but there were not yet in the planning .
in the previous versions of &amp; digi@@ tised , the image processing was only a picture @-@ view for photos . currently , it is very fast to a tool for mani@@ p@@ ulation of your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of the image processing .
the default gain is that all green pixels are equal . if you use this option with a minimum loss of details , this difference creates a mesh in the output . this option identi@@ fies a bit soft , eliminated but the 2x@@ 2 lat@@ tice model with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD @-@ quality method .
when this option is set , the white equ@@ als of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used .
this setting is only used when the white equ@@ als is not set . standard is it a fixed color balance , based on a white card that was photograph@@ ed in the sunlight .
this setting is supported only for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SLR cameras . the use of the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images in four steps will get more details in the det@@ ector . for other cameras this option will be ignored .
the standard is it the red@@ dish , so the parts of your images are burned down , due to the in@@ ability of your camera the sh@@ red@@ ded white . use this setting crossed out in various ro@@ at@@ ö@@ fe . last@@ ly , you can try some parts of missing information from the det@@ ector to re@@ construct .
this is possible because blue pixels in general not feel as fast s@@ ati@@ ble as green and red . &amp; digi@@ b therefore try the missing green and red propor@@ tions from the yet not saturated blue pixel . of course this is a question how much colour or white you want .
if you select the option , you get the option to put a level . here a value of three is a compromise and can therefore be adapted individually for each image .
put the l@@ umin@@ ous value to your taste . you probably have to put it a bit higher than the standard 1 . however , this can also be done later in the picture options of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ments . in order to keep the time for de@@ hum@@ idi@@ ties small , you should proceed conserv@@ ative .
a demo@@ os@@ a@@ icing for the algorithm is a digital image process to get a complete image from the parts image . this algorithm is also available as C@@ FA @-@ inter@@ pol@@ ation or color @-@ construction .
&amp; digi@@ w ; and D@@ cra@@ w put you three alternatives available : Bil@@ in@@ ear , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gradient ) was the first algorithm that was used by D@@ cra@@ w . but it creates colour @-@ art@@ ef@@ acts to the edges . Bil@@ in@@ ear is interesting if you are looking for a fast solution with a acceptable result .
if you know the color of your l@@ enti@@ ls you can get the red and blue o@@ fre@@ ading values here . this is certainly the best method for a color@@ box correction , since you are performed during the raw converting .
a profile will translate the color information and gives instructions on how to be given again . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ation ; information as translate from a color tree into the other so that the colors are as accurately as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; behaviour issues when a picture is opened in the image processing / colour management module with raw files . &quot; &quot; &quot;
color @-@ profile folder set here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .c@@ ol@@ or / ICC , where you can save all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ b ; examine this folder then during the start .
configure the ICC Profile you have the option &amp; quot ; default squ@@ oth ; for your profiles to be depos@@ ited . everything can be changed while opening the raw file .
the color management view is an alternative compared to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your pictures and not the whole screen .
the input profiles should be designed to the camera performers and the model that you use . not all profiles are created on the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which does not contain dy@@ ton gam@@ ma , not for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you need to perform the color @-@ tone mapping itself .
there are other options like the Soft @-@ proof profile , with which you can em@@ ulate what your picture of a device would be back . this is very useful to print as your printer has a smaller color area than your camera and some colours therefore can be very satisfied , instead of leaving on the blin@@ ded algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras it is quite obvious that colour profile is intended for them . unfortunately , not in the models of Canon . therefore , a table of cameras and profiles can fit together . of course , this answer is obviously in@@ official :
the Canon Prof@@ iles extension makes the style recognized for the target : F for accurate style , L for landscapes , N for neutral , P for Por@@ tra@@ it@@ and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; image Plugin interface . it is an interface supported by a series of &amp; k@@ de ; pixel and image processing . many modules support , which were written to work with each program , which supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select that you want to use , and these modules will appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition you will find some also in the context menu of the preview .
short @-@ commands for tasks that are performed by modules , can set in the menu under settings short @-@ errors .
for further information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I @-@ modules you can get through the K@@ IP@@ I project on http : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the di@@ asch@@ au should be easy to understand . the upper regul@@ ator j@@ us@@ ks the time between the images , normally are 4 @-@ 5 seconds good . the other tick @-@ sections turn off the met@@ adata , or out that appears at the bottom of the pictures during the display .
the camera properties on the left there is a list of all currently supported cameras . on the right above there is a button automatic detection , the camera is connected to the computer . below are the port@@ folios . currently , are the port@@ folios . currently , here are Seri@@ elle , US@@ B@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire @-@ mass storage .
at the lower end you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wi@@ re@@ - ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) -@@ mass storage am@@ lu@@ gs from the camera list . you have to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / take , specify on which you hang your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ tised , you must connect the camera to your computer , to connect it in the display mode .
try out if &amp; digi@@ tised , the camera automatically recognis@@ es . if not , you can set camera od@@ ell and port manually . after you have set your camera , your camera will appear in the menu camera .
you can select any name for your camera . this is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window . if you own more than one camera , you can insert them all here .
with the option confirmation document for the re@@ loc@@ ating of &gt; Images in the tr@@ ash bin , you can display the talk of &amp; digi@@ tised ; when del@@ eting a photo set in an album . in the del@@ e@@ tion of a photos and del@@ eting a album you will find further details .
the editorial changes due to the right side@@ bar can still be applied through &amp; digi@@ ti@@ tion ; otherwise , if you use the option changes in the right page row without a refund . otherwise , you need to apply changes to the button below .
you can also check the display of the screening of &amp; digi@@ tised ; in case of star@@ ters . this speeds up in under the start process of &amp; digi@@ tised .
the setting Bei@@ m start looking for new photos are forced to look for new or deleted albums / photos . this extends the start time of &amp; digi@@ tised ; . if something from the base folder was deleted , asks &amp; digi@@ tised ; you whether it should delete it from the database .
different shades may be used in &amp; digi@@ tised , in order to adjust the main window to your tastes . these settings allow you to select settings design from the toolbar . a preview of the available designs will be below :
these designs are defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ation , you will find further information about this tutorial .
&amp; digi@@ tising ; contains a fast image processing with some basic tools . you can use this to view your photos and to correct and improvement . the image processing can be started by a click with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by the context menu of the preview and selection of the inser@@ tion indicators / editing .
the image processing contains a series of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ tising ; so they are not part of your distribution . you can find more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules in the section .
a status line at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ ename , current fil@@ ename , enlargement factor and the current image size shows .
a menu bar on the top and including the toolbar for fast access to the most frequently used functions .
the editing functions of the image processing alter your photos . however , any of the functions will change the original photo before using it or used the button save from the toolbar . note that you can no longer restore the original photo as soon as you have saved the image .
so you should possibly customize a copy of your image before you change it . this allows you to save it with File Save as complete .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original balance by using the Settings File Recovery or use the button &apos; button &apos; button in the toolbar . you then lose each change that you have done on the photo since the last time .
almost every action of the image processing can be revers@@ ed or restored . the last action you can make back @-@ run by selecting ren@@ dering or restored by selecting Edit from the menu .
if you often use this , you should turn the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ trl . -@@ Z to rec@@ ede and C@@ trl .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; about the return or re@@ produce button in the toolbar , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu applications , all the actions are also revers@@ ed or restored .
once you have started image processing , you can move between photos in the same album or the same key@@ word by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar . if you &apos;ve made changes on the current photo , you will be asked if you want to save it .
you can take in the picture and perform zo@@ oming in which you use C@@ trl . mouse wheel or symbols in the toolbar or the entries in the in@@ sured menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the toolbar : mag@@ ni@@ fier factor automatically
view full screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode . you come to the normal view , in which you use the Es@@ c button . usually , you can view this in motion dialog by &amp; digi@@ tised , change it from the &amp; digi@@ tization ; main window will view . see the section for inser@@ ting the image processing .
if you want to print the actual picture , you can select in the menu picture and get the default &amp; c@@ de ; print dialog . you can customize the settings before you print your photo .
from the main menu you can print individual pictures or whole sent@@ ences . entire picture @-@ pages can choose from your selection . you only need to select the pictures with the standard methods and select from the menu album ex@@ porting printers . if you follow the wiz@@ ard , you only need to make your choice .
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; main window has a side@@ bar on the right edge , which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same page row is available without the navigation device . it is displayed when one of the five rider is cli@@ cked on :
multi@@ f@@ aches Click on the same rider makes the page bar appearing or disappear into the border .
in the print@@ able view , you can insert or insert screen@@ ings with unlimited size . the text is U@@ TF @-@ 8 compatible . that means all special signs are allowed . the compl@@ ements will be copied into the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC@@ - fields so that you can be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data support only ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut according to 2000 characters and special characters will be re@@ formed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling field in other applications , you should consider these restrictions .
after you commented it , you either use the button or just change the next picture , the cap@@ tions will then be saved .
in addition to the applied @-@ button , there is a button More . with this you can read further met@@ adata in the selected file or database . however , you can also read the met@@ adata in the files . however , this will always be performed if you have selected a met@@ adata settings that is always written in the pictures .
the rating shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and s@@ orting . it can be used either with a single mouse @-@ click on the 5 stars in the page row or with the keyboard short@@ cut . to evaluate multiple images at the same time , select it and use the context menu .
the rating is written in the IP@@ TC field . the coding follows the sch@@ ema in the following table :
the keywords display a search box for fil@@ tering the keywords , the keywords , and a file @-@ box with the previously used in this &amp; digi@@ ti@@ led ; -@@ session was attached .
the key@@ word tree is adjusted dynam@@ ically to the given search key@@ word . you can quickly restrict the number of possibilities in search of a key@@ word . this ability is particularly useful if you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom is another relief in entering keywords in a picture series . if you have given various keywords , these are stored for quick access .
keywords can also be set by mark@@ ers of the appropriate bonds fields in the tree ; all the keywords of an image are stored in the IP@@ TC field key@@ word .
if several pictures are selected in the main view and select a key@@ word in the key@@ word , this is only applied to the highlighted picture and not on the entire selection , if you want to have a selection with a key@@ word , please read the key@@ word filter .
the page row , key@@ word filter is used to change the selection of displayed in the main window . usually , the left page row will be used with their album , dates , key@@ word and search views . if in addition one or more keywords are used from the right , the cutting @-@ item is displayed on the right . all the keywords are available .
you can also draw and put it . suppose you have selected in the main view several pictures to provide you with keywords . if the key@@ word already exists , you can simply drag it out of the right side@@ bar and put on the selection . then a dialog you ask if you want to put the key@@ word .
in the upper example , the main window shows the images on a calendar tag . the key@@ word filter is selected in no keywords , selected the quantity of three pictures . they were selected with C@@ trl + a , and then , a key@@ word from the right key@@ word tree was moved and there . a dialog asks if this key@@ word should be set .
this search for changes takes place every time of the program . you can also be disabled at Settings .
if you have a rule with and created and determine that it should be one or would have to change it easily with a double @-@ clicking on the text and the rules .
( 1 ) : the entry in which in the database is searching for . this may be an album , name , key@@ word , key@@ word , key@@ word , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or a string that is already set in the database .
for example , you can specify a Exten@@ ded search on all elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group options , you only need the p@@ addle at the end of the rule and then use the button groups . the options are then as follows :
why have Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Flick@@ r not listed ? the free space is limited there on 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution there .
this article / tutorial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I found it mostly on &amp; digi@@ came ; s concrete implementation adapted .
the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow , that the colors will come from your camera or scanner , you can achieve that the colors on your monitor , those from your camera or scanner , and the colors you print or publish in the web that suit you from your digital dark@@ room .
when the theme is based on colour management , then everyone wants to push for the outcomes which he wants . unfortunately , the meaning of this tutorial is to provide you with adequate information about colour management . in addition , you should make links with deeper information to make your own informal decisions and make you obtain the desired result .
if your image runs all the six listed below , you must not take care of colour management .
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated at the s@@ RGB @-@ Far@@ br@@ aum . ( more information can be found below )
your only other image files are sent by e @-@ mail or the web , where the RGB of de @-@ fac@@ to standard is standard .
so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life for everyone so easy , why should one use another color tree and so that thoughts have to make thoughts over col@@ ouring books ?
a visual example of limitation of s@@ RGB compared to the colors that we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hu@@ fi@@ isen@@ shaped region , and the colours in the s@@ RGB color tree , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger color trees , so visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms exc@@ ell@@ ency page and then click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
must I improve my monitor if I decided to work only in the s@@ RGB color tree ?
yes ! whether you work in the s@@ RGB @-@ Far@@ br@@ aum , or not , you need to monitor your monitor , since s@@ RGB is that your ; on@@ itor can work on s@@ RGB mode , so you must either use your monitor on the RGB RGB RGB mode ) , then you must either use your monitor on the s@@ RGB Standard Edition or both .

this tool presents five automatic correc@@ tions which can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before you attempt a further manual process .
the functions norm@@ alize , dis@@ similar and contrast enhancement from the menu correct automatic correction automatically try out of your colors the best . you will have to experiment with these effects , to see which best suits your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method will sc@@ aled the lumin@@ ous values over the entire image so that the dark@@ est point black and the bri@@ gh@@ test point as bright as possible will change without its color p@@ adding . this function is often a stomach correction for pictures that are dark or washed .
the same : this method j@@ us@@ ses the lumin@@ ance of the colors of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogra@@ m of an image is as flat as possible . at times , it has the same very good results in improving the contrast of an image . sometimes it also produces a very powerful operation that affects either mir@@ acles in a picture or it destro@@ ys it .
automatic in the same way : this method maxim@@ ises the colour area in the red , green and blue @-@ channel . it det@@ ects the dark and bright thres@@ holds and j@@ us@@ ites the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogra@@ m area .
contrast : this method improves the contrast and lumin@@ osity of the RGB values of an image by the post@@ p@@ one of the lowest and highest values on the greatest possible range and a res@@ um@@ ance of all values between them . this is only visible in mature images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the whit@@ ew@@ ing of &amp; digi@@ tised , is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the whit@@ ew@@ ing of a picture .
the whit@@ ew@@ ing correction is slightly restricted as over a color tree with 8 @-@ bit per colour . in case you can perform far from the origin@@ ating area , which works with over@@ exposure mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , so your ways to make correction better off .
this tool is based on a white ab@@ rup@@ tive @-@ mis@@ m of the copyright by Paw@@ el T. Mel@@ ym . you start him via the menu entry colors white .
the pron@@ unci@@ ation can be adjusted in size . on the left are both the origin@@ ating picture as well as the preview of the target image . the preview is adjusted dynam@@ ically to the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original white straight , then it suff@@ ice on the lower window .
the th@@ umb@@ nails of the target photos has a red mark@@ er . the L@@ umin@@ ance of the Pix@@ els under this mark@@ er is shown as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogra@@ m .
to the right above , a hist@@ ogra@@ m is displayed , as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogra@@ m is very helpful to , even in well illumin@@ ated images , most of the pixels very small lam@@ umin@@ ate levels . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ aire .
the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and gam@@ ma . the shadow pen@@ ises lets you improve the shadow details of your photos or even down measurements .
An@@ stat works with the above controls placed on pi@@ ps , you should use the color temperature of Pi@@ p@@ ette . press on this button and then somewhere on the picture show to use the color temperature of the White @-@ like color . in this way , the temperature and green values will be automatically set .
in addition , you can set the white equ@@ als with the list of preferences . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposure indication increases the colors when more than a color channel of the Pix@@ els is over@@ exposed .. You will see the combined result in the white @-@ comparison . this is displayed in the pre@@ viewed as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the buttons Save as and load exactly this . every setting of the white dress you can set up here in a text file and later re@@ load it .
the kno@@ b preferences set out all fil@@ tering values again on their default values as well as the per@@ tin@@ ent white cream . please note that also the neutral settings may be found another photo as your original text . if you save it , your origin@@ ality will be changed .
you can set here the co@@ thick@@ er depth per colour @-@ channel of the ordered image . 8 @-@ bit co@@ coding is a widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit co@@ coding is better for high @-@ quality pictures . this coding requires also more panel , calculation time and stands available for the formats PNG , PN@@ M , TIFF and DN@@ G .
this tool opens the same dialog as the processing of raw images . it uses the change and the assignment of colour pro@@ fil@@ ly . color @-@ tone mapping may be carried out by the under@@ balance for the brightness . a detailed guide for the use of colours can be drawn up in the chapter of colour management .
another important tool can be found in the menu under Color Ton@@ value Cor@@ rection . this tool makes an integrated way to store several color channels at the same time . this is helpful if your camera or scanner always use the same error and you can always find the same correction . in the manual you need more information .
a very powerful option to fix the coating process is the tool for the Grad@@ ation that you will find in the colours of Grad@@ ation in the menu .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; tool color @-@ effects will give you four color @-@ effects , a solar installation , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a cant@@ een @-@ filter at your disposal .
in times of the chemical processing , Solar@@ isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ ans , an effect of the image was destroyed by the extra light . this had the effect that the lighter ranges dar@@ ker and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second lighting . the result was a partial neg@@ ation of the image . this tool allows you to try this interesting effect fine .
the intensity controls the Solar@@ isation . at about 50 % intensity the picture shows what chem@@ ically possible is possible . another raise is finally creating a negative image that doesn &apos;t generate on photo paper .
this is an example of the solar installation . the original alb@@ ild is the ( 1 ) and this is working ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vivi@@ d @-@ Filter sim@@ ulates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ oth ; effect . it is different from a satur@@ ation that he has a stronger contrast @-@ effects that makes the colors brilliant and smooth . try it simple , he emb@@ ell@@ ished many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name provided by the Japanese company F@@ UJ@@ IF@@ IL@@ M . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and hence a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colors in day@@ light and high contra@@ sts . this character@@ ization make him a film of choice for nature photograph@@ ers . Vel@@ vi@@ as are very saturated color but also some photograph@@ ers , especially those of the most beautiful landscapes .
the Ne@@ on@@ filter sim@@ ulates Ne@@ on@@ light on the contra@@ sts . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the sli@@ der re@@ peti@@ tions the strength of Ne@@ on@@ lich@@ s . in large images the filter can re@@ load the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not un@@ common that you want to correct the color @-@ tr@@ ast and lumin@@ osity of your photos with the tools in the menu under colours . all your judicial authorities can be viewed in preview . once you are satisfied with the result you use the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
if you get a photo by low light conditions , you can get the revers@@ ed problem : one to big s@@ ati@@ ation . even in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation can reduce it . any changes you can perform in preview . if your result you like the result you can confirm your changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tools Grad@@ ation and the simple light intensity / gam@@ ma / gam@@ ma is the instrument of ton@@ ing correction to improve the exposure . even though the dialog to this tool is very complicated , you need for the details explained here in the area of sli@@ ders . made of concrete the three sli@@ ders below the hist@@ ogra@@ m .
the window contains a graph@@ s of intensity , a hist@@ ogra@@ m , active channel , or of the selected area . below graph@@ s are three sli@@ ders in which are cli@@ cked and the left side represents the dark On@@ es and the right side represents the bright areas .
the easiest way to use the wa@@ iter is to post@@ p@@ one the regul@@ ator and watch it on how the image changes .
on the right hand , the original and preview of the picture can be viewed . the preview is dynam@@ ically based on the settings of the image . on the left , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : with this file box can be adjusted whether the hist@@ ogra@@ m is represented with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y axis . in pictures of a digital camera , the linear hist@@ ogra@@ m is domin@@ ating from a single pillar . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic classification is useful .
three regul@@ ator : the top for the dark &apos;s tones , the average for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones , commonly called gam@@ ma@@ ves .
the three colour @-@ chains can be used in the preview of the original image , in order to automatically ext@@ ingu@@ ish the seek@@ ers of shadows , middle and light tones . in addition , there is a button for fully automatic alignment .
out @-@ rated : the exten@@ ders allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two regul@@ ators to change inter@@ actively like in the input assessment . the com@@ pression of the out@@ ga@@ te can be used for example to create an out@@ fit picture as the background , while something else is in the fore@@ ground .
automatically : with this button , the imaging values will be automatically set depending on the values of the image .
store as and store : with these buttons , the included values in the fil@@ es@@ ystem can be saved and later re@@ loaded . this will be used the g@@ p levels format .
if you use this mode and the three shades , the input values will automatically re@@ install for all shadows , means and sun @-@ tones . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image for Rot@@ - , green@@ - , Blue and the L@@ umin@@ ate channels .
the option over@@ exposure indi@@ k@@ ator controls all colour channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only shown in preview and it &apos;s no effect at the final result .
below you can see an example of the alignment of the input from applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and Alpha Channel , as well as the exten@@ ders are unchanged . the original picture is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) .
on the left , half of the origin@@ als and the target image will appear . the preview is updated dynam@@ ically depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available :
modification channel : this file box allows the channel to be changed from the module :
besides this cas@@ ket there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a log@@ arith@@ mic view . for pictures that were recorded with a digital camera , the linear mode creates a wide range of beams . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic mode will help .
if you move for example a short panel to the right , for example the bright sounds , then you can see that these bright tones with dark f@@ ga@@ ze will begin and the per@@ me@@ able pixel are dar@@ ker .
by preview the original photos is a red mark@@ er to see . if you want to change this mark@@ ings on the section you want to change is a suitable line on the curve that represents the original value . create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is according to your taste .
save as and store : with these buttons you can make exactly this . each bend that you have created with it in the file system saved and later loaded . the file format is the Gim@@ p cur@@ ator format .
if you make this method and the three colour shades automatically create the check@@ points of curve for all channels of shadow , middle and solar @-@ tones . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original picture to set the control points for the red , green , blue , and lo@@ umin@@ ate curve .
the option over@@ exposure indi@@ k@@ ator controls all color channels to over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ loaded pixels , you get the combined effect displayed . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only shown in preview and it &apos;s no effect at the final result .
below you can see a black @-@ white photo that was corrected in the L@@ umin@@ anz@@ kan@@ al . Sch@@ atten@@ - and Sundays was used with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the cur@@ ves . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel mix@@ er of the &amp; digi@@ tization ; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color shades of the photos .
the channel mix@@ er is another highly developed tool to mix the shades of images . you can edit it from the menu colours channel mix@@ er of the image processing .
with the channel op@@ tionally you can select the color for the hist@@ ogra@@ m : this gives you a first note how to preview the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash . the left area of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed as compared to your own rider .
the th@@ umb@@ nail of the target group has a red mark@@ er . if you can position this in the picture a vertical line in the hist@@ ogra@@ m to show you the corresponding color value .
the controls for the module are right down : regul@@ ator for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you also enable general brightness , as the channel mix@@ er then DAS tools to generate great black @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try the Grün@@ canal for black @-@ white por@@ traits .
sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me , the reduction of one color leads to a visible noise , which occurs from the color tree , which does not appear in the same place in colour . if that is the case , you can improve your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me conversion in which you will reduce the color first .
the stor@@ ing as and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any Mix@@ er setting can save you for later and then load . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mix@@ er format .
the option over@@ exposure indi@@ k@@ ator controls all colour channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only shown in preview and it &apos;s no effect at the final result .
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been re@@ acted . the option L@@ umin@@ ate is activated . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the edited picture under ( 2 ) .
black / W photo has always been fascinating because of your abstr@@ action . with the development of digital photography . with the development of digital photography , as colors can be converted easily on the machine . also with a set of film @-@ roll profile .

green filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white filtration filter with a green light filter . this looks good at all scen@@ images and fits particularly well to por@@ traits against the sky . thus , similar to the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter .
orange @-@ fil@@ med : sim@@ ulates a black / white filtration filter with a or@@ ous Lin@@ sen@@ filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and air photos . thus , similar to the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) orange @-@ fil@@ med .
rot@@ ary filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white filtration filter with a red light filter . this creates dramatic asc@@ ents and can sim@@ ulate mo@@ on@@ light of time @-@ time . thus , like the 003 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) rotor .
joint @-@ filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white fil@@ tering filter with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural colour ton@@ er and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow @-@ filter .
Sep@@ i@@ aton : creates warm bright and medium @-@ tones as it adds a bit col@@ dness in the sh@@ att@@ acking of a pressure and the re@@ development in a Sep@@ i@@ at@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and thus similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
the &amp; digi@@ tising ; tool texture allows you to apply decorative tex@@ tures to an image .
through adding a text to your picture , regardless of whether it is a color picture or not , you can look it like an oil painting , a pop @-@ portrait on a wall . the menu entry into image processing can be used for this .
relief : move this parameter to the right increases the sem@@ bl@@ ance of the depth and three @-@ dimensional texture on the image .
a paper Tex@@ ture@@ Tool has been applied to the photo below . the original balance is ( 1 ) and this changed under ( 2 ) . the parameter Rel@@ ief was set on 200 .
the &amp; digi@@ came ; tool framework can add a decorative frame to add an image .
keeping the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . a way to keep his attention is to put the picture a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier to the asp@@ iring eye . under picture frame , the module can be started from the image processing .
type : with this parameter , you set the desired cream type for your picture . in detail the picture with a coloured line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce surrounds it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black @-@ white pictures ) , Ab@@ sol@@ ete it with a cute three @-@ dimensional frame of the ideal for a button resistant and decorative adds a decorative frame with patterns .
width : displays the width of the frame in percent . the value means for the width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
the target icon will be larger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for the pressure of the pictures , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio .
with this handy tool , you can easily create a form@@ atted text in a picture at any point . this also goes to several places when you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with your mouse . use Tex@@ ture , orientation , color from the color tree and the character size . the larger the image , the larger must be the character . at the end , simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background . already the picture is finished .
each setting which you have chosen for your text can be altered until you click the button &quot; OK . after the picture was recorded , the text is part of the picture . it can no longer be changed .
the &amp; digi@@ zer ; tool allows to apply a template to a picture .
the menu image template in the image processing can be used to put in touch of a picture .
for the template , there are no restrictions on the size and orientation . however , you need to add the PNG format and should work with maximum com@@ pression ( 9 ) for the reduction of file size of the template , so just send an e @-@ mail in English to the &amp; digi@@ b ; Mail@@ ing@@ list digi@@ tised @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use this tool for the first time , you have to put your Schabl@@ as folder with the button base folder in dialog . select here the folder in the you will be copied for the next start .
after the root folder for the Tattoo Stencils appears a building intelligence that reflects the folder structure of the Schabl@@ as . the selection of a folder will be updated the preview below automatically .
under the Pre@@ view you will find three buttons with which you can change the mag@@ ni@@ fier and adjust the position of your image .
enlarge : this button increases the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
reduction : this button push the below image . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole image , you need to cr@@ ush the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move this button to move the image below using the template . take this image and place it at the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then be automatically adjusted .
&amp; digi@@ came ; provides three different tool for shar@@ pen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
shar@@ pen@@ ing is a traditional tool for shar@@ pen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but , especially in dark areas , gran@@ ular images .
Un@@ shar@@ p@@ est mask is working on the contrast of the edges to make a picture tough@@ er look . actually , it &apos;s not a bit it works rather psych@@ ov@@ is@@ u@@ ell . you can use it to remove atmosph@@ eric Dark Dun@@ st and it makes here a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and he is protected by Win@@ ston Chang .
re@@ foc@@ uss@@ ing is perhaps the best of the three because he really improves shar@@ p@@ ness . he is a little more complicated in his application and has various parameters to adapt .
photos without focus and most digi@@ tised pictures need a correction of the shar@@ p@@ ness . this is in this case that the dig@@ ital@@ isation process can be combined with only minimal differences . the same phenomenon can be observed if color points are printed on paper . SLR cameras usually need more retro@@ actively shar@@ pen@@ ing as normal cameras for private user .
at JPEG @-@ images is often applied for a camera internal shar@@ pen@@ ing . images in the raw format , they must always be stain@@ ed during the processing .
some scanner address a shar@@ k microphone already during the reading of the image . if you dis@@ able this , you get the control of your picture .
in some situations you can obtain such results by using a photo with the shar@@ pen@@ ing value break@@ down . this allows you to view using the menu entry .
you should hereby deal with caution because the results are not very natural : the shar@@ p@@ ness increases the edge of the edges , but rein@@ forces the cra@@ fting technique for shar@@ pen@@ ing an image the tool re@@ foc@@ uss@@ ing . on re@@ foc@@ uss@@ ing you can find further information and a comparison of all techniques for shar@@ pen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : one image is a snack . the solution , the image is a little soft to draw , is much easier than it to shar@@ pen . use the tool for soft@@ ness using the menu entry settings and experiment with settings . the push pattern on the right of the dialog box shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter bl@@ ur@@ red is a very good tool to remove grinding from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the origin@@ als and the th@@ umb@@ nails will help the picture to edit . this display shows the edition of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the standard values produce frequently good results and should first be tried , increasing the radius or amount ampli@@ fy the effect . if you make the in@@ shar@@ p@@ est mask , become smoking and the impression of gr@@ ats near sharp edges .
the radius poses an how many pixels on each side of a can@@ te are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . therefore , you should keep pictures best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the wi@@ ped picture one of the original is added . thus , the strength of the loop is set .
the tail value is a break from the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount . one can thus define a minimum difference in order for a can@@ te of filters . in this way , these areas are avoided with a soft shift between the tones and hence beauty @-@ error in faces , Heav@@ ens and water surfaces .
this is an example of the bl@@ ur@@ red m@@ ask@@ eted filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the worked picture the ( 2 ) . bl@@ ur@@ red , was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a sw@@ elling = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ led ; tool re@@ foc@@ uss@@ ed a picture by improving the shar@@ p@@ ness . it used to be protected by copyright @-@ protected un@@ folding filter by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries to move a picture of &amp; quot ; re@@ foc@@ uss@@ ed ; in which it is a technology called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ ters . he often uses better results than un@@ sharp sc@@ alp . you can start it from the menu by calling colors re@@ foc@@ uss@@ ing on the image processing .
in practice the circular sa@@ ver works far better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;s F@@ altung . the Gau@@ ß &apos;s F@@ altung are a very long tail , which leads to the mathemati@@ cal results from the source pixel depending on the original score . it is even very strongly influenced by the distant pixels . it causes unwanted results .
circular d@@ well@@ ings : this is the radius of the circular condition . it is the main parameter for the use of this module . for most photos , the default value should put 1 good results if your image should be very bl@@ ur@@ red , but should respect it at Heiligen@@ sch@@ eine .
cor@@ relation : an increase in cor@@ relation can help arti@@ facts . the cor@@ relation can be chosen from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0,95 and Chain . a high value for the cor@@ relation reduces the shar@@ p@@ ending effect of the module .
smoking @-@ filter : an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . however , values higher than 0.1 but rarely is helpful . if the noise filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 the image quality is very bad . a usable value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value will be the image even further sm@@ iling .
Gau@@ ß &apos; sche shar@@ p@@ ness : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ß &apos;s shar@@ p@@ ness . use these parameters when your in@@ shar@@ p@@ est Gau@@ ß &apos; is . in most cases , you should use this value to 0 to avoid anno@@ ying arti@@ facts , so you might also need to increase the cor@@ relation and / o@@ der@@ t@@ weak filter .
matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation atri@@ x . an increase in the size of the size atri@@ x may have chosen good results , especially if you choose great values for the circular shar@@ p@@ ness or the Gau@@ ß &apos; s shar@@ p@@ ness . in most cases , you should choose great value for these parameters . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
stor@@ ing as and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any number of re@@ foc@@ uss@@ ing parameters that you have set will be stored for later and can then be loaded .
try all fe@@ eds , shades and intensity correc@@ tions in the picture before you use the module .
otherwise you should use the module before you modify the image otherwise . the reason for this is that lots of operations the changes not immediately visible are left out , but later left un@@ pleasant art@@ ef@@ acts .
if you read pictures and com@@ press , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ com@@ pressed image .
generally , bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king produces better results than shar@@ pen@@ ing . this could be causing this bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king a bigger neighborhood as a shar@@ pen@@ ing .
theore@@ tically , bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king always must produce art@@ ef@@ acts . even under optimal conditions it can never be the effect of inj@@ ected filters . practically the result of the FI@@ R Vienna Fil@@ ters is always at least as good as the Un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ed mask . the FI@@ R Wiener Filter is often better in treating small details .
below you can see a comparison between different filters on a small un@@ focused picture :
the original un@@ sharp color pattern that must be corrected . this picture was done with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to in@@ sufficient light for the auto @-@ focus lens .
for more information on the methods of shar@@ eholder structure in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address .
the regul@@ ator smoo@@ thes the dis@@ shar@@ p@@ ness of the area was dra@@ fted , in order to generate a natural P@@ up@@ ille .
the h@@ edge allows a suitable color for the pu@@ pi@@ l . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can adjust this here .
the tool pic@@ t@@ orial re@@ frac@@ ture is one of the most advanced tool in order to remove unwanted arti@@ facts with un@@ preced@@ ented speed .
the In@@ ner algorithm was developed by the IMA@@ GE team of the GRE@@ C CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool includes various pres@@ ets as a Star@@ points to simplify the restoration . the available pres@@ ets are below en@@ umer@@ ated :
if you want to use the fil@@ tering settings , you can use the tab smoo@@ thing and advanced settings .
detailed sec@@ rec@@ y &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the maintenance of the details . a small value leads to a equal smoo@@ thing over the picture . Wo@@ against bigger values mainly be homogen@@ eous regions and details . a value of 0.9 should receive details so that no shar@@ pen@@ ing should be down@@ right . please note that the details of detail should always be subordin@@ ated .
stra@@ igh@@ tening dependence Alpha &#91; 0.@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smoo@@ thes in all directions , while a value is close to 1 only in one direction , or CCD Rau@@ ges will produce a high value wave @-@ like patterns . JPEG arti@@ facts are best at a value in the vicinity of 1 .
smoo@@ thes &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum gl@@ uc@@ tion@@ factor regarding all@@ es. p defines the relative smoo@@ thing . put this value therefore suitable to the degree of smoking in your picture .
reg@@ ularity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter involves bigger structures . the higher this value is determined , the more is smoo@@ th@@ ed , as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a van Gogh &apos;s tur@@ mo@@ il effects he must be set higher than 3 .
re@@ peti@@ tions : can be passed on as often the algorithm . usually reaches here 1 or 2 .
prot@@ rac@@ ite page da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angular @-@ based integration of the an@@ is@@ ot@@ rop@@ en Alpha . if Alpha is small chosen , it should also be chosen as a small running time . so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs .
integral step@@ width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral part @-@ page in pixels . you should set the value of small 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoo@@ thing and never bigger than 2 .
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation use : the more quality you get through the selection of this option is only small . it doubles , but the running time . we therefore recommend it to release it .
the buttons Save as and loading accurately this . any adjustment of image errors can be saved into a text file and later re@@ loaded again .
image errors is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can still take very long and take a high CPU load . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button break@@ down .
below you can see how pic@@ ks with Small art@@ ef@@ acts are corrected . as you see , there is a peculi@@ ar black arti@@ fact that caused by poor movies during the trip is wur@@ del@@ .@@ The original picture is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ led ; rob@@ ber@@ y @-@ reduction is a very powerful tool to l@@ essen image @-@ smoking . it uses a protected algorithm by Peter H@@ eckert .
this tool represents sel@@ ectable image filters available to remove spots and other art@@ ef@@ acts , e.g. by dust or hair on the lens , remove . it can also be used to remove sens@@ ory from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ des ; -@@ effects of sc@@ ann@@ ed images from books or magazines .
if you need more information about Sensor@@ rau@@ schen from digital cameras , so you can read them in English in this tutorial .
the screen@@ shot up indicates a typical scene that was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gr@@ assy ledge that can be successfully removed with this tool .
the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the lower advanced settings can remain with the default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) up to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . high values increase the time required by the filter per pixel and can observe the image . the time is moved by the image and the colour in it becomes lo@@ vel@@ ed and therefore smaller mistakes were clear@@ ed .
shar@@ p@@ ness : controls the shar@@ pen@@ ing level . this value is set to determine the difference between the filter to the front and to determine ligh@@ test changes . you may need to change the edges @-@ filter , if you change this setting . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter details do not get more and ru@@ ff@@ ing or black@@ sm@@ ith begins again .
edges : controls the watch@@ ings for the shar@@ p@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong can not be removed all the noise or cra@@ f@@ ads can occur . put it on a value near the maximum , if you want to remove a vig@@ il@@ ant or JPEG @-@ art@@ ef@@ acts without losing details .
light density : controls the lumin@@ ance of the image . we recommend you either paint or lumin@@ ance to change in order to improve a picture . these settings do not influence the smoo@@ thing process , controlled by the details -@@ Settings .
colour : controls the color @-@ toler@@ ance of the image . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to change in order to improve a picture . these settings do not influence the smoo@@ thing process , controlled by the details -@@ Settings .
Gamma : controls the Gam@@ mat@@ ol@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance levels of the dark areas , which typically smo@@ kes are stronger , although he also merge the shadow &apos;s divisions .
d@@ amping : controls the adap@@ t@@ ying of the ph@@ as@@ no@@ bles . this value is defined as quickly the adap@@ tive filter radius re@@ acted upon variations of lumin@@ ous resistance . if it is lifted up , the edges may occur . if he can occur at his minimum , can remove smoke and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter to the edges . he can remove bu@@ ck tips and is the recommended method for it .
saving below and loading : these buttons are used precisely for that . all parameters for smoking reduction that you have set can be stored in the fil@@ es@@ ystem and later loaded .
this is an example of how smoking the reduction can change your life . the original picture is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . the smoking reduction was applied with the default settings .
sometimes an image is a naked for your purpose . the solution to paint the image a little soft is fortunately much easier than one image to shar@@ pen . use this tool for soft@@ ness using the menu entry and experiment with the smoo@@ thing . the pro@@ ud@@ der on the right of the dialog displays the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ tization : photo Restau@@ ration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of undes@@ irable art@@ ef@@ acts of your pictures . he is very well adapted to meet Gau@@ ß &apos; sches Rau@@ schen , Kom@@ pres@@ sion@@ art@@ ef@@ acts and local mistakes which occurs in digital , original or subsequent digi@@ tised pictures . the smoo@@ thing takes place along the image cont@@ ours and thus gets the content as it does the human eye .
the same algorithm can be used for color and text release . the text message is performed with another tool , the pic@@ t@@ orial re@@ frac@@ ture , performed by the IMA@@ GE Team of the GRE@@ C CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g Project .
JPEG Art@@ ef@@ acts reduce : the com@@ pression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far from it . as a missed com@@ pressor &amp; quot ; art@@ ef@@ ak@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that are shown in the un@@ com@@ pressed picture . this setting is meant to correct these problems .
the buttons Save as and load exactly this . every setting of photo restoration can be saved into a text file and later re@@ loaded again .
photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . but it can still take very long and take a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time with the button .
below you can see how to reduce a photo with a like @-@ like rou@@ gh@@ s .. The module is applied to a black and white photo that with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 films with an sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the coated film gran@@ ularity on the faces . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the corrected one under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures have been reduced to an old colour photo , which was created with a scanner . you can see the scan arti@@ facts that were caused by sc@@ ann@@ er@@ lighting and photo paper . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; tool Hot@@ merge allows hot@@ es from photos showing with a CCD camera gem , eight were removed . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pix@@ i project which are protected by Martin Dick@@ ens .
bright , total or hot pixel are especially in high @-@ quality raw mode photos a problem , as many cameras with JPEG com@@ pression have a built @-@ in repres@@ sion of hot pixel .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixel _ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright Pixel@@ quot ; in a photo with a dark image method . there are currently no manual method to select the bad pixel .
download this file into the wiz@@ ard with the button dark picture . the tool will automatically identify the hot and bright image . these are highlighted in the picture show .
if you have an old digital camera , it is important to have the dark picture directly connected to discover new hot or bright pixels by CCD faul@@ ts .
first , as described in the previous section , you should find the matching dark picture to the corrected image . please note that the wiz@@ ard will notice the last dark picture and this automatically loads in the next session .
the image area and the preview will help you correct the results within the image . the preview of the filter shows the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixel are emphas@@ ised in all occurr@@ ences .
select an area around the def@@ ective pixels on the th@@ umb@@ nails and the outcomes of the filter . select afterwards the best filter method to pol@@ ishing these pixel blocks . these are the available filters :
Dur@@ ing : it is determined an average of the neighbour &apos;s values . the resulting color is assigned to all def@@ ective Pix@@ els on the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this is made separately for horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block , will be pul@@ led to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ DIM ) or a group of lin@@ ear@@ as cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ DIM ) or a group of linear pixels in block to inter@@ pol@@ ishing .
square : this is the standard fil@@ ter@@ method . all the pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are moved to a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ DIM ) or a group of square cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ DIM ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ishing the pixels in the block .
cu@@ bic : all the pixels with a distance of 3 or less are moved to a bi @-@ ku@@ bian surface ( 2 @-@ DIM ) or a group of spher@@ ical cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ DIM ) that is used to inter@@ pol@@ ish the def@@ ective pixels in the block .
below you can see the pixel correction on a color photo , from a def@@ ective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure , applied . the original picture was increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ tised ; Vign@@ alle@@ ti@@ zing Cor@@ rection is a tool to correct the Vign@@ et@@ ort , i.e. under@@ going corner , an image to correct .
Weit@@ win@@ Celtic objective , especially the middle and large photo@@ graphic format , can frequently illumin@@ ate the entire sens@@ ory area . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ ed@@ quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they can reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light to the sensor there . Tele@@ obj@@ ective may also appear this behavior .
but he also has dis@@ advantages . many centers filters require a factor 1.5 or 2 at the flash filter , which is impossible to keep the camera with the hand . Weit@@ win@@ Celtic objective should also use the center filter , an opening of f / 16 or small , as otherwise in@@ def@@ ec@@ effects may arise through motion .
with the big expos@@ ures of today &apos;s film and color @-@ scanner , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of a c@@ enter@@ piece by means of an equivalent transformation in a raw image which is used without these filters . the tool Vign@@ alle@@ ti@@ zing is applied to a picture on . the algorithm is protected by John Wal@@ ker .
with three controllers you can control the Vign@@ alle@@ ti@@ zing and three other expos@@ ures of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of lumin@@ ous absorption at the point of the biggest density filter . the default is 2,0 , resulting in a optical filter with a bli@@ p adjustment of 2 , de@@ com@@ fy .@@ Incre@@ ase the density to compens@@ ate a bigger degree of vig@@ or , reduce it to compens@@ ate for a small degree .
light intensity , contrast and gam@@ ma Settings : the editing of an image with the Vign@@ ti@@ zing Cor@@ rection reduces the lumin@@ osity of the pixels . they must re@@ produce the exposure of the target with these options . the regul@@ ator present you only positive values as you need to raise the settings just .
if you want a fin@@ er re@@ fine of the target images , so let the values for illumin@@ ating / contrast / gam@@ ma at zero and use the Grad@@ ation from the menu color Grad@@ ation .
this is an example of the vi@@ ti@@ zing Cor@@ rection that is applied to a picture . the original balance ( 1 ) shows the correc@@ tive image in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image . a leu@@ ch@@ ur@@ ke@@ - and contrast correction was also carried out in the image with this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; Lin@@ sen@@ ver@@ zer@@ ron is a tool to correct the impact of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a protected by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric dist@@ or@@ tions . colored dist@@ or@@ tions may not be corrected with this tool .
the co@@ efficient of the second Gr@@ ades treated the general geomet@@ ric dist@@ or@@ tion of the lens , and can correct the con@@ cave or con@@ v@@ ex form of the picture .
the co@@ efficient of the third Gr@@ ades has a similar analysis , but flat on the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the co@@ efficient fourth gr@@ ades corrected the remote corners opposite to the second Gr@@ ades . if you combine these two can be eliminated every geomet@@ ric dist@@ or@@ tion .
generally : this value controls the strength of the dist@@ or@@ tion second Gr@@ ades . with negative values may be corrected with negative form@@ ations , and positive values c@@ ran@@ ged dist@@ or@@ tion .
corner : this value controls the strength of the dist@@ or@@ tion of the gr@@ ades . this value acts stronger at the edges as in the center of the picture . for most lenses the &apos; corners parameters has the &apos; corners parameter to the parameters of the parameter .
zoom : this value will be sc@@ aled the image size and thereby leads to the correction first Gr@@ ades through . negative values enlarge while positive the picture is reduced .
bright : this value distingu@@ ishes the brightness in the corners of the picture . negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values they increase .
to help you find the best fil@@ tering settings , illustrated the dialog with a preview the dist@@ or@@ rection correction . the values that you use for your picture will be saved and used as default values .
the t@@ onn@@ el or cold correction should be performed in front of all of the cutting or size changes . best perform this correction as of all the first . in case you are able to cut an image and then perform a t@@ onn@@ al correction would be the effect of fal@@ seh@@ ood .
to help you find the best correction is available to show you this tool a vertical and a horizontal locking system . move it to an important place , such as the sea side or a building wall , in your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . afterwards , you can correct the t@@ onn@@ el / k@@ issen@@ ales with the help of the lines .
if you correct a k@@ ick@@ y bran@@ ding , the resulting picture will have black no@@ oks . you can transform them with the cutting tool in the menu , cut out of the image processing or about the zoom Reg@@ ler of this dialog .
for most pictures the t@@ onn@@ al correction is sufficient . the next logical step for some moti@@ fs like e.g. recordings from the front , frame and paintings , it is the perspective so correc@@ ting the all angles in the picture 90 degrees . note that when you hold the camera with the hand you will always have a slight dist@@ or@@ tion of perspective .
this is an example of the t@@ onn@@ al correction applied to a church in Norway . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method for sim@@ ulating infrared film of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u@@ .org web page which is accessible in this URL . the filter re@@ produced the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) S@@ FX@@ 200 I@@ infr@@ ar@@ ot@@ film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rectang@@ le with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the picture .
below the th@@ umb@@ nail you can see two parameters set by fil@@ ming and sensitive sensitivity ( ISO ) . the ISO regul@@ ator changes the quantity of cut@@ ters and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in the conversion . green meadows are white as snow !
since the filter color channels for re@@ produce infrared film mis@@ ses , especially the green @-@ channel makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos , as the color informations are missing .
this is an example of infrared fil@@ tering applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the edited picture under ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the movie was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values produce a kind of au@@ ra in the main field .
the &amp; digi@@ tised ; filter fil@@ gr@@ itt is a simple to re@@ produce film gr@@ itt on your images , such as the B / W Ko@@ dak Tr@@ i @-@ X , known . to increase the sensitivity of movies , the manufacturers mix large silver gran@@ ules of photo em@@ ul@@ sion .
the film gran@@ ularity gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . in case you want this special , Galerie @-@ like , rhin@@ oc@@ ular , gran@@ ular sight especially in your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ men photos , so you have to use this filter .
with the controller , the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ularity of the gra@@ ins . the default value is , although frequently higher values are required to be adjusted to ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need even more gra@@ ins , you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of the film gran@@ ules of a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and working the ( 2 ) . the original image used corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; filter oil paintings produced the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ tization : filter oil paintings gives your digital pictures a nice appearance as an oil painting . natural images and still life are good for this effect .
there are two regul@@ ators to influence this effect . the upper vote the brush size between one and five out of . thick@@ er brush are suitable for big images . smoo@@ thes , smoo@@ thes or , from the other side viewed , the hin@@ ge .
this is an example of the oil painting . the original one is marked with the ( 1 ) and working with the ( 2 ) . Brush size for this 640 pixels big picture is 1 and smoo@@ thing 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ tising ; filter coal @-@ drawing uses col@@ ouring and int@@ ens@@ ory gra@@ ves to create an coal teles@@ cop@@ ing . the lines that outlines the outlines in the drawing are st@@ resses . images of their gradient function are therefore not ideal for this effect . it &apos;s helpful if you would like to imagine , which scene you would have chosen to catch you . this would be good pictures to start with it .
there are two regul@@ ators with a value @-@ ranging from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper shelf is sel@@ ects the foundations and the lower j@@ us@@ ite the contrast ( smoo@@ thing ) .
this is an example of the classification filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be improved by adaptation of the int@@ ending value .
the &amp; digi@@ tised ; filter engra@@ ving your image in 3 @-@ D , as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses a copyrighted algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; filter engra@@ ving is a fast tool to re@@ tire your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . he works particularly well with pictures with a simple structure where color is not the most important in the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to turn the image into a grey , mo@@ red landscape .
the depth allows the contrast of the fil@@ tering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default .
this is an example of the engra@@ ving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the edited picture ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this fil@@ tering , you can transform a normal photo into a artwork by means of dist@@ ort se@@ wer systems . it uses the protected algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave @-@ blocks 1 : divide the image into cells and makes it look like if it is considered by glass blocks .
wave @-@ blocks 2 : analog to the shaft blocks 1 the picture is dist@@ orted here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects need long time to calculate and create a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time with the button .
with this fil@@ tering , you can transform a normal photo into a artwork by means of shar@@ p@@ est effects . it uses the protected algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Un@@ shar@@ per : consume the image along a star @-@ shaped lines that goes from one centre . this sim@@ ulates the in@@ shar@@ p@@ ness a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of often in sports photography .
radi@@ al Un@@ shar@@ p@@ ness : im@@ pressing the image by rotation of the pixels by a center . this sim@@ ulates the dis@@ shar@@ p@@ ness of a rotating camera .
removal : the image around the effect of a non @-@ foc@@ uss@@ ed camera lens . the object appears to come back in the background .
movement for movement : consume the image through horizontal motion of pixels . this sim@@ ulates the in@@ shar@@ p@@ ness of a linear movements , z : B : from a car or train photograph@@ ing , camera .
smoo@@ thing in@@ shar@@ p@@ ness : wi@@ pes the image sof@@ tened in the dark and strong in the light tones . this is ideal to create romantic Por@@ traits ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic Por@@ traits , Gl@@ am@@ our @-@ photos or to adding a warm and subtle bulbs .
shar@@ pen@@ ing hardness : im@@ pressing the image by random shift of pixels and sim@@ ulates the dis@@ shar@@ p@@ ness of a random moving camera .
intelligent Un@@ shar@@ p@@ ness : finds the color @-@ bas@@ ins in the picture and consume them without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : shares the photo in rectangular cells and then creates it , through the col@@ t with an average pixel value , new .
some effects need long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time with the button .
the Reg@@ ent@@ ro@@ p are a cute little tool to make reg@@ ent@@ ro@@ p on your image . thus , it gives natural your images a nice appearance . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n by protected algorithm .
dri@@ pping size allows it to change the size of the dri@@ ps . since the dri@@ pping size doesn &apos;t automatically change with the size of the image it is often necessary the size for small images to decrease . number changes the op@@ tic effect of drops on the picture .
you can hold with the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zer ; editing a range free of reg@@ ent@@ ro@@ p . use the selection tool to choose the area , e.g. a face , which is free to stay free . if you start afterwards the filter reg@@ ent@@ ro@@ p , the area will remain free of reg@@ ent@@ ro@@ p .
this is an example of regul@@ ator Fil@@ ters . the original picture ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the edited picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it by mir@@ rors or rotating into the right orientation . the tools for this can be transformed into the menu and trans@@ forms mir@@ rors .
photo infl@@ am@@ bles is definitely one of the most advanced tools in order to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality .
one image to cr@@ ush is simple . the big question is , how can you rise in an image and see the details ? how can you find the missing information again or guess ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm that is used here is a good work . try him and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . choose to change size in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog can be seen below .
the tool to adjust the size uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to enlarge the pixels . if you want a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool to bu@@ b@@ lowing .
many image processing programs use a type of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge a picture . &amp; digi@@ tization ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo was developed by the IMA@@ GE team of the GRE@@ C CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g Project .
you must tell the tool how you want to change the size . these settings are available in the tab New size and are listed below :
the aspect ratio is kept , when this setting is enabled , the new size of the original image is to be maintained .
reg@@ ularity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter involves bigger structures . the higher this value is determined , the more it is difficult , as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a van Gogh &apos;s tur@@ mo@@ il effects , it must be set higher than 3 .
the buttons Save as and loading are exactly used . each inser@@ tion for photo enlarge can be saved as text file and later re@@ loaded again .
photo bl@@ ases is very fast at what it makes , but it can still take very long and take a high CPU load . you can cancel calculation at any time with the button .
you can see below an example for photo bl@@ b@@ bles by adding a small display on the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged image ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of the lin@@ ear@@ as standard Aug@@ mentation , compared to the comparison .
the cutting of a photo is not only a common operation , but also a commonly under@@ estimated tool to create a picture . the image processing allows you to create a photo with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and pull the rectang@@ le , then you will see this rectang@@ le while you move the mouse .
if you leave the mouse button again , the area of the photos is cut off . this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after the cutting area . you can drag the size of the rectang@@ le by clicking on the corners of the rectang@@ le . you can simply drag the size of the rectang@@ le by clicking it with the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cutting section , use the button The access button in the toolbar and the photo is tailored ( C@@ trl . + X ) . use the entries file Save or Save File to save the newly cut picture .
in the precau@@ tions , you can change the size of the rectang@@ le by post@@ p@@ one the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog remains intact .
in the mold After cross@@ ings , you can specify the orientation as a vertical format or cross @-@ format . in the high format , the larger value of height and width is assigned to the width .
the tool after aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use cen@@ tim@@ eters , In@@ ch or any other physical size . you can see e.g. below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their side ratio .
at the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to select the selection automatically horizont@@ ally or ver@@ tically .
down@@ ward in dialog you can set by the Max . relationship to the section towards cutting , depending on the chosen relationship and orientation , set .
the device &apos;s aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the orientation orientation ( Horiz@@ ontal or Vertical ) . if you use the cutting tool for the next time , these settings are stored as default values depending on the orientation . the changed image dimensions are displayed in the EX@@ IF data sheets , so that the EX@@ IF data are able to reflect the cro@@ pped image and not the origin@@ ality .
help the inter@@ locking assistance allows help to bl@@ ends your images better . these help are :
harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic particles are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . as the third @-@ reg@@ iment , harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles are a possibility to share a rectang@@ le in a similarly harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles on the di@@ agon@@ ets .
Golden Center : the golden centre is a division of a different natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us pussy , or the flo@@ wer@@ ing leaves of a sun@@ flower . it emerg@@ es in all possible things to be found as beautiful .
the golden partition is the ir@@ rational number 1,6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it has already been used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks , making your temple and pyr@@ ami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden spac@@ ing in all times when you set your images , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number derived from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 , 21 , 21 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 21 , the golden centre . a composition that this rule is regarded as visual harmon@@ ious .
the golden middle represents the liquid @-@ discs under@@ lines when you put an image together . these help are en@@ umer@@ ated below :
the Golden Spir@@ al will bring you to your goal good results for your photos . compared to the third @-@ reg@@ el , the golden spiral lines will follow the eye through the image . this type of composition leads the view of the spect@@ ator along the line of spiral and creates in this way a symmet@@ ric visual river .
a further rule are the justi@@ fication of the golden spiral , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . it should give something that the eye can be at the center of the composition . this can be a line or different objects . this something can simply be there without the eye , it will fulfill its task .
the Golden tri@@ angles also lead from the above golden spiral . your ver@@ tices are the middle points of the pages of the golden tri@@ angles . note that in contrast to harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not syn@@ onymous tri@@ angles . di@@ agon@@ ally to place these lines can be a static object dynamic .
if you use golden tri@@ angles in order to break up your frame create an effect of professional photograph@@ ers dynamic symmet@@ ry . try to place your picture focus on one of the cutting points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you can &apos;t achieve .
the options horizont@@ ally reflect and vertical mirror can be used to mirror the harmon@@ ic particles .
with the button color you can set the color of the Help lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the auxiliary lines can be invisible . in this way you can adjust the color of the lines on your current picture .
the free rotation is a tool to rot@@ ate a picture at any angle .
if you make a photo , then it happens easily that you are the camera not exactly ver@@ tically or horizontal . this creates an image where things came around a angle . you can fix it with the &amp; digi@@ tising ; editing and the tool free rotation and j@@ us@@ ate the target angle .
rot@@ ate your image with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this sli@@ der are stated in degrees . with the kno@@ b default you can set the sli@@ ders again on 0 degrees . a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture are shown on the right top .
to your help , the Module Free Rot@@ ation provides a horizontal and a vertical line available . move the mouse cursor to position the two lines , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now edit it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now j@@ us@@ ks the angle as described in the previous section .
once you have shot a picture you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to fix it is the function transform@@ ating from the image processing .
an elegant way to cut the image is the function macro @-@ cut . select one of the following options :
the option Anti @-@ Ali@@ asing is the image a bit after the rotation . please note the above warning .
all per@@ spek@@ tive transform@@ ations are performed by a fix@@ ture to the so called reference point . this point is represented in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares to the corners of your image . the preview is then automatically re@@ comp@@ uted . on the right of the dialog box you will find some information which help you to change the perspective :
new width : shows the width of the new image , including the empty zones that have been created by transformation in pixels .
new height : shows the height of the new image , including the empty zones that have emerged through the transformation in pixels .
angle left at the top : displays the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed region .
angle right at the top : displays the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the trans@@ vers@@ ed area .
angle left below : displays the current angle in degree at the lower left corner of the transformed region .
angle right down : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed region .
after the adaptation of the perspective the picture will be a little dis@@ agreement . for a single adjustment this effect is small , but two adjustments produce a twice as strong effect and you should avoid it if possible .
after which you got the perspective you get un@@ happy tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to regret it is the image to cut them out of the image processing .
the purpose tool is used to post@@ p@@ one part of the image into one direction and move the other part into the opposite . a horizontal pattern , the image will be dist@@ orted . in other words , a rectang@@ le is turned into a Parall@@ el@@ ogra@@ m . you can start this module via transformed shooting .
sn@@ ap your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angles . you can press horizont@@ ally and ver@@ tically at the same time . if you press preferences , the angle is displayed on zero . a preview of the effects will show you and the new dimensions of target image are shown to the right of the preview area .
to your help , a vertical and a horizontal line is hidden . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall of a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool @-@ tool to remove your picture .
after which you have carried out the shaft , the image will usually negl@@ ected . for a single wel@@ ded this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two sc@@ are comp@@ elling twice as much bl@@ ur@@ ation and therefore you should avoid this .
after the shot the image has un@@ beautiful three @-@ angular holes in the corners . a way to eliminate it is the image with trans@@ forming cutting from the image processing .
&amp; digi@@ came ; needs a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . therefore , the available formats therefore depend on your system and , in some cases , of the way these libraries were comp@@ ili@@ ated . in most distribu@@ tions you will edit a large number of image formats using &amp; digi@@ tions .
due to this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on their system . however , you will always find JPEG and TIFF .
&amp; digi@@ tised ; only files in formats listed in the list . if the extension is listed in the list , the file is listed in the list . you can change this list of file extensions . you can change this list of file extensions . in the section configuration , you will find further information .
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or black . some cameras do not allow you to select the format . a more detailed description of this file formats you can find in the Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ came ; supports both formats .
image com@@ pression is the application of data com@@ pres@@ sion@@ ing on digital pictures . redund@@ ancy provide redund@@ ant information in order to save the image data on a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , gl@@ atter@@ ing results as JPEG in the same com@@ pression balance . the 200@@ 0s version can also save lo@@ st@@ less if this is specified in the settings .
if you want to know more about the raw format , you can read about Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in colour very helpful instructions in English . you can find raw materials in JPEG or black with the raw material converted from &amp; digi@@ tised . in the section configuration you will find further information on the use of modules with &amp; digi@@ tised .
&amp; digi@@ came ; supports the store of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is included in &amp; digi@@ tization . all support cameras can be seen below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a brief list of raw form@@ ates that came from &amp; digi@@ tization .
many digital cameras will support the recording short films . these clips are often saved in A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ation ; however , is not a film editing program and then has no built @-@ in possibilities to view or edit . &amp; digi@@ de ; the &amp; k@@ de ; settings for playing movies are used to play the program for playback .

many tools that you need the photo processing are in &amp; digi@@ tising ; contain your description follows here .
all image processing tools such as shar@@ pen@@ ing , soft@@ ness , vibr@@ ating , bl@@ ur , bl@@ ur@@ ce , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform dialogue type that displays the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you can see &amp; quot ; texture outside ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar indicates the status of the filter on the current image . links from him allow five buttons to change the comparison of the pre@@ viewing area . these modes are :
ver@@ tically sharing without duplic@@ ates . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected fore@@ front .
horizontal without duplic@@ ates . the upper area shows the original and the lower indicates the filter applied to the area below the selected fore@@ over@@ head .
vertical parts . the left area shows the original and right to compare the effect of the filter .
horizontal . the upper area shows the original and the lower compared to the effect of the filter .
&quot; mouse over &quot; style : shows the preview when the mouse is not in the pre@@ view@@ able and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can switch on to show over@@ - and lower @-@ exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general imagination .
( 3 ) : the frame to choose the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the image and move in the part of the picture , by which you want to see the preview . preview in the left part of dialog will be updated instantly .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings can be measured from the last use of the module .
the page row features shows the essential information about the selected image and is largely explained by itself . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo features : shows a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos . these data come from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this rider provides an intui@@ tively plug @-@ tool based on the Mar@@ ble plug @-@ program . you can press with the mouse wheel or bending it . press C@@ trl ; lin@@ ker mouse button to draw a square . all pictures within this coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . of course , that requires your photos Geo @-@ data contain .
&amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; is an editor for pall@@ ets files . the application can be used for editing color pal@@ ettes and for selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
the pall@@ ets files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de ; can be used either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case they are in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; Settings and hot user defined color and allowance are used colors .
in the dialog range you can select from a list of installed ro@@ ses or browse the folder to files .
the cursor is shown in the pall@@ et view as a line . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
it shows on the colour side . the color is described under the pall@@ et view . here you can also change the color name .
it can also be used to select . to create such a selection , click the area next to a color to move the cursor to the bottom . then move the mouse to pressed mouse button .
if the p@@ addle cast@@ or is inserted below the button color , the color is inserted in the colour @-@ board on cursor . the color will either be inserted either or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether the mode is over@@ write . this mode you can adjust by clicking the tick @-@ column over@@ write under Al@@ m cursor .
a selection that is generated as in the last section , can be copied along with the actions , cut and paste .
&amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; uses the following format for data in the cli@@ p@@ board : for each color three values for the propor@@ tions of red , green and blue and an optional colour character , followed by a separate colour , if there are three numer@@ ical values in the cli@@ p@@ board , can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ;
the colors in the palette and the output of colours can be drag@@ ged with the mouse .
select a color anywhere on the screen and then select it in the color selection on the left .
&amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; is a KDE program for the viewer of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; graph@@ s are used in science , especially in inform@@ atics . so far there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graph@@ s &amp; X11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with just few functions .
the &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; Project has set itself the objective to replace these programs by a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical user interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; cold ; program .
&amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; is a KDE program for the viewer of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; graph@@ s . showing graph@@ s with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI . it has the following functions :

if you open a graph@@ ite box outside a running &amp; c@@ graph@@ ite ; instance , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; c@@ graphical viewer ; instance or want to display the lad@@ der graph@@ s in a sub@@ window of the existing instance .
as with the last option you can permanently save your choice , but also change it with the dialog dialog .
during the program start , you can open all the graph@@ s of your last session again . again , you can save your choice both as well as later .
you can also specify how the graph@@ s should be divided into several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be chosen freely .
when you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph@@ s are to be placed on a page . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled by the respective parts of graph@@ s .
page preview with one on several pages distributed without head@@ line and with another font
the page again store gives the possibility to specify the behavior if a file has been modified on the hard disk , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can set a standard behaviour ( automatically re@@ load or ignore the changes ) or the program every time .
the site Open is the option to specify the behaviour of &amp; graph@@ s ; you can specify a standard procedure for this case ( graph@@ s in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or determine that each time is in demand .
the seat management gives the possibility to specify the start behavior of &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; you can specify a standard behaviour ( the files of the last session or not ) or determine , in each case to be asked .

here you can choose among different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; lay@@ out@@ algorithms . the entries as described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; are :
&amp; dot ; -@@ algorithm , the standard for align@@ ed graph@@ s . it produces hierarch@@ ical or curved graph@@ s . the algorithm puts the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and trying to produce as short edge and as few ben@@ ds as possible .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for illumin@@ ated graph@@ s . it produces depic@@ tions under the spr@@ ing@@ spring mod@@ ells . in this context , the cam@@ ada @-@ Kaw@@ ai algorithm is used to syn@@ onymous with statistical multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm creates a spr@@ ing@@ spring @-@ model layout . it uses the fru@@ g@@ man @-@ clean gold designs , and includes a multi @-@ fl@@ ake de@@ emer used for treatment of great and g@@ ec@@ lu@@ ster@@ y graph@@ s .
the &amp; cir@@ co ; algorithm ranks the k@@ not circular according to the description of six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and Kau@@ ff@@ man and meadow , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ c structures .
opens a dialog by which you can specify a layout , which is then executed by a shell , and the clear@@ ed layout of graph@@ s can provide you &amp; eg ; the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; algorithms special options , or also change the graph@@ s with a filter before it is drawn .

the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization is tools available to locate images geograph@@ ically in the cel@@ esti@@ al coordination system , which is used by GPS and Galileo ; height , long@@ itude and lati@@ tude .
to cor@@ related your pictures with geographic data you need a GPS track as XML @-@ file in g@@ px @-@ format . g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel and g@@ p@@ sman can download the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ograph@@ ical loc@@ alization Kor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can result in a number of previously selected pictures with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ related in the main window and call the menu . the top on visual dialogue will then be . to load a possible cor@@ relation over time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a track file using G@@ P@@ X file . of course , this file contains exactly the same time at the same location , as the images of your camera .
if the file is loaded , the automatic cor@@ relation is performed by the coordinates in red . GPS track data is recorded in GMT . this can be converted with the time zone . this can be done with the time zone . Set here your camera zone .
the setting for maximum time devi@@ ation gives an upper devi@@ ation for the GPS Time and Camer@@ ab@@ eit . lies the devi@@ ation below the data is gathered . the maximum value of this is 2000 seconds .
if you don &apos;t have a track of a place for pictures you can manually edit the g@@ px file and add to the images . the differ@@ ing frequency of 2000 seconds will then mix all pictures in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ishing and differential in price can be used if you do not have appropriate data . if you know that in reality a LO@@ K@@ ATION is located in a wide range of differ@@ ing between camera and GPS , you can put this limits here and then push the button cor@@ related to inter@@ pol@@ ishing .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful when you have taken a number of photos at the same place . as the dialog you need to use the coordinates of a call to the next notice , you only need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo .
the LO@@ K@@ ATION can also be found and set in line with the indicated region and enlarge it . select the appropriate region and enlarge it again , until you have reached an adequate accuracy . the card can always be chosen manually . the map can be changed between card mode , satellite image and a mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are ways to hang the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that the exi@@ ft@@ ool is used to provide a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module image gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums into a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.01 . you can select the albums that can be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is co @-@ 8 to facilitate the best possible internation@@ alisation .
the module has four riders in which the settings can be adjusted . you only need to select all the albums that are exported to HTML . you only need to select a large number of albums . in the area below , you will quickly find a large number of albums . in the area , the Al@@ ben@@ vor@@ schau and the text of which appear in the head of the HTML page will appear .
the rider &apos;s appearance defines the general look and layout for each side . this rider is largely explained . the option for each image created a site created in each image is displayed a new page displayed in the image . otherwise , the image will display directly with your default screen , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show , displayed
the rider album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be saved with all your associated images . select a folder on which you have permission . a sub @-@ folder containing the name KI@@ PI@@ XE@@ Export which all contains , will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF @-@ Bulletin will also be saved in the new images .
with other color depth , you can change the standard color depth . of course , the file size is also influenced by all other settings themselves explained .
the rider g@@ age@@ images allow you to adjust some of the settings from the album rider for viewing images , these are small images that are displayed in the gallery to adjust .
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press breaking around the process to break down .
when the module has created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore read the programs out to determine if error occurred during the generation . the web browser will automatically start at the end to view the preview of the gallery . click Connect to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I image reference is a very fast and flexible OpenGL based tool to view images .

with the import option of the met@@ adata module , you can copy data from one image to another . select the picture that you want to copy in the main program and then select the image file . so you will then copy the image to which you want to copy the met@@ adata . you will be copied by the button OK button .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not in any target format . JPEG is supported in writing . please check out exi@@ v2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of slideshow .
the MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length to convert . this module uses the packages of M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick . between the individual images you can add a audio file to the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the Di@@ asch@@ au .
all images will be sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . in addition , you can select a background color for the slideshow . with this module it is possible to use formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you must first choose the pictures to be packed into the MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au . afterwards , you can create the module MPEG di@@ asch@@ au .
the pictures selected by you are then listed under image files in the Portfolio . there you can also change the s@@ orting of images or the content of the list .
once you are satisfied with your list , you should customize the other settings . the video format can re@@ produce from different formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . PAL is pres@@ t and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step , you should indicate the time in seconds the one image is displayed among them . a low value creates very su@@ dden , a high on the other very smooth image change .
the background color can be set next . in doubt you should let them black . the name and the path of the created file you can specify under name of the MPEG output file . keep in mind the extension mp@@ g .
if you specify a audio file under the name of the audio source file , this will start into the movie . depending on the button codes you can start creating the movie . depending on the speed of your computer you can get a drink quickly or in all the peace and enjoy the slideshow whenever you are back .
if a note appears that co@@ ders or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ J@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick packages using the button below to the right below .
the printer driver allows you to print multiple images on a piece of paper in standard Photo@@ sizes . the combined images can also automatically be opened using image processing Gim@@ p . this is e.@@ g : sensible to improve you or print with the Gim@@ p module for direct printing .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import and convert your videos in one of three formats to JPEG , TIFF , or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave coff@@ in . an original z@@ it@@ at of Him is : expect from d@@ cra@@ m not that it creates the same results like the software from your camera performers . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w better results ! .
first , select the raw file to be converted , and start the module . the Ra@@ w image converter will then appear in mode for a single image . with the button preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture .
you can now optimize the values new to optimize the conver@@ gence process . the first option is decides whether the camera settings can be used for the whit@@ ew@@ ays , brightness and red / blue amplifier . if the result is not optimal you can edit the picture later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected so you can use the contrast information . if your camera is working in RGB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switch has no effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the output results . the fil@@ ename remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a los@@ sy algorithm and produces for it the smallest file sizes .
the tagged Image format , TIFF , maintains all the information of your image and uses the des@@ patch @-@ free LZ@@ W Com@@ pression .
if you plan to process your pictures frequently or later , you should not select the JPEG format , as there is only a limited number of operations allowed before the image quality is worse . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you choose to select JPEG as a memory format , the met@@ adata contained in the raw file are stored in the JPEG file in the ex@@ if information .
if you have adjusted your settings , you can start with the execute button . if you want to break this process again , you can cancel this process .
the st@@ ack@@ able mode allows you to convert different images to once . use this mode once you are safe , e.g. by gest@@ ures on a single image which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for individual pictures . however , however , you have the possibility to automatically over@@ write existing file . however , one preview is not available . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced .
this module can be used to com@@ press all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used for ren@@ aming of all images of a album . you can set the pre@@ fix that will be used to fix the number and tim@@ est@@ amps .
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a image collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can enlarge the image or enlarge four types of image change :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is automatically selected , depending on the image orientation , selected . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for e.g. to customize your picture to the screen format .
not proportional : not propor@@ tion@@ ate size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed at this option .
pressure preparation : prepare the image for the photo print before . the user can adjust the pressure resolution and the size of the photo slideshow . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color , is adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images to your preferred email address . it is also possible to change the size of the pictures prior to the pictures .
once you have started the module , the pictures window will display with the pictures selected . on the button pictures you can add or add a file sel@@ ector with a file sel@@ ector . for the last selected image , you will see a preview of the right .
you can also drag and drop images on the picture list and to add it to the list of the images below .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the kno@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button pictures remove the selected images from the list of the images below . &quot; &quot; &quot;
once you have selected all the pictures you can open with the button OK the new message -@@ window of your e @-@ mail address . you just have to add the addresses and the header pages . the pictures selected are attached to you as an app@@ endi@@ x .
do not pay attention to many pictures at one time . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations for the size of the send e @-@ mails . it may be a good idea to send more mails when you want to send a lot of pictures .
the e @-@ mail window will be used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is saved and used each time until you change it .
select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you choose Thunder@@ bird , then you will need to specify the correct path for your installation .
if you use the Google Mail Service , you have to install the G@@ mail@@ Agent on your computer before . you can download it here .
following the selection of comments in a hung file , the comments to the images will be put together into a text @-@ file and attached the mail .
the PNG format below the menu images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to free @-@ free formats such as TIFF . you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast Internet connection and the photo quality is not to be changed . otherwise we recommend you to JPEG @-@ format .
if you select JPEG among images file format and the original files in the JPEG format are , then the original ec@@ if@@ data will be added to the pictures .
if the process is finished , the window will not automatically be closed so you can view the status messages , in search of errors , but your e @-@ mail program will be started automatically at the end . with the kno@@ b button you can drop this window ?
following the start@@ up of the module advanced Di@@ asch@@ au appears a window with questions like you have shown your slideshow . you can choose between the selected and all images of the album .
the OpenGL transi@@ tions in the presentation are activated very elegant cap@@ tions by OpenGL . however , you need to have a corresponding graphics card , because otherwise it will be very slow .
the fil@@ ename option indicates that the fil@@ ename of images in the lower left corner is displayed during the presentation .
the loop option ensures that the presentation will display in an end loop . you can manually draw it with Es@@ c ; ab@@ ort .
the option images acci@@ dentally choose that the pictures are displayed in a random order . so it will not be used the order of images in the album .
below delay between pictures can be set up the tempor@@ al distance between the individual pictures . 1500 mill@@ is@@ econ@@ ds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . so you should check this before presentation your friends !
there are more than a do@@ zen survi@@ vor@@ s between which you can choose . random@@ ly chose in any transition between the pictures another effect .
during the slideshow you can access a toolbar on the upper left side of the road@@ side . move the mouse into this corner to turn off .
with this toolbar you can stop the presentation and start again to start the previous and next picture and stop the slideshow .
at the left bottom of the road@@ side you can see the current file names , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Time &amp; Date j@@ us@@ len has currently no documentation . if you are interested in writing these , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ org@@ . attention : the participants in this list speak English .

once you have made your pictures and videos with editorial notes , you can see with &amp; c@@ photo@@ album ; see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the picture , are now available in each group , so in persons , places and in the group of keywords .
in the browser window you see the categories , for which you have given information as you have given your pictures and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations . in addition , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , which look at the folder structure on your hard drive and of course the current viewing images .
when you press the mouse on the entry , the view is changing . see picture .
if you select another person , only the pictures are shown on which both persons are to be seen . through this choice , you can restrict the number of pictures shown by a few thousand pictures on a few more pictures .
if you have selected all the people , places and other settings , you can view pictures to view the images of your efficiency .
in the picture , each person has the same symbol in front of their name . you can save with &amp; c@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person a separate pre@@ dat@@ or store , which is of course also applicable to places , keywords , and other categories you have defined yourself . see the picture .
to view images in addition to the name , select the button , which you want to use on the right outside on the toolbar . it has the advantage that you can display for example symbols with images of individuals and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you do not possess appropriate pictures ) .
you must also specify which image is to be displayed for each individual person . in order to display this , you will need to view the picture in@@ let window . in the in@@ sured window , you can adjust the image factor according to your wishes and can choose which part of the picture is displayed or cut .
if you enter the main window entry , you will see a dialog that is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . this dialog can look at the picture once more .
if you enter a string into the column or description , the compl@@ ements or descriptions of the pictures are searching for this text , for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the lower part of the window you can browse all pictures following a specific name , as you can see in the picture . here , after pictures , on which jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are pic@@ tured .

if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a personal HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar looks here : . as the name suggests , this bar shows you data statistics about the images in your database .
the tim@@ eline can show you several different types of time . each tab shows then a different unit . you can switch between the units , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you see a part of a database by stopping the bar only 10 @-@ minutes .
the tim@@ eline you can use in the following ways : you can select the shown entries Pre@@ view from the database , you will see the first image of this date in preview ( displayed ) and also displays the tim@@ eline the current date of the currently shown pictures when you navigate in the preview view .
you can also select a section of the tim@@ eline by pressing the mouse button and select the mouse over the rul@@ er of the tim@@ eline , therefore the sched@@ ules , you will see in the preview view only pictures of this period . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a beam of tim@@ eline .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; present you two options available to create HTML pages with your images , which is integrated in &amp; c@@ photo@@ album ; and the other as a module is available ( see ) . the following part of the user &apos;s manual is described in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the integrated version you can create over the Settings menu .
before HTML pages you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and destination . in the following , each area is described more exactly .
first enter the title of the title and a description that should contain HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML @-@ example , you can see an example of these settings .
next select whether a &amp; c@@ photo@@ album ; export @-@ file is to be created on the overview page . nutritional information on export files can be found in .
finally , you can select which information on the HTML pages are to be displayed . for example , all pictures of a party are obvious . please note that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; currently all pictures are ex@@ porting . you can not use this setting to hide certain pictures from particular attention .
in this area you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings options are un@@ ambig@@ uous , which is why this is not specifically noted .
at the bottom of the page you can adjust various resolutions for the images . there@@ with , those who have to view your website and possess a monitor that will have a maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no images download for example a resolution of 1600@@ x@@ 1200 .
the vie@@ wers of your site can change the resolution at any time . so , he can browse your pictures with low resolution , which leads to a lower transfer time , as if he wants to show an image larger , he moves to a higher resolution .
in this listing , insert the different folder and the URL where your site is stored .
the best select a base folder for all your HTML files and for each subsequent set a new sub@@ folder .
first , you have to select the main folder in which all your images will be saved . this folder will be saved and automatically added by the next time . here you can select either a folder or one of KDE supported protocol for example :
once you have created your pictures , you can check if this really all is visible for vie@@ wers . if you select a URL for the basic folder after the pages were created , the URL you set here should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will launch in the wrong folder .
if the files created by you are not yet in the final target folder , you will need to manually copy them there . so the import function , behold , correctly you need to specify the final goal of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the basic folder in which all sub@@ folders are .
the only described settings can be referred to all three on basic folders or URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder , whose name will set you in output folder .
if you &apos;re on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , together with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , you might want to create a HTML page for viewing the pictures . however , if you write a lot of time for viewing the images , reception , etc . , then you have to do with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this work is not even possible .
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others to your database . the image properties are imported with ex@@ - and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they are in the file , whether the images are stored on the file or if the file is saved into the file . the benefit of all images in the file is set aside . however , the obvious down@@ side is the file size .
you can either create a .@@ k@@ im File either directly from the menu File Ex@@ porting ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im File together with a HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im File .
an external .@@ k@@ im -@@ file searches the images in two @-@ fold way . first , the corresponding pictures are not found , so the images of the URL that you have entered in the folder of HTML files . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using HTML export .
in the following , dialogue will be described for the export of pictures , which you can access the File ex@@ porting process .
the most important option of this dialog box is whether it is to act by internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available :
at the option Manual in the vicinity of the .@@ k@@ im file , you need to copy the images in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the option Automati@@ sch in the vicinity of the .@@ k@@ im @-@ file copy and k@@ photo@@ album ; the pictures automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . as most pictures already were com@@ pressed with JPEG , and the XML file itself is very small , it &apos;s usually not worth the files to com@@ press . if you like this , just select the option export file com@@ pressing .
the last option of this page reads Maximum image size limit . if you want to send your friends photos , you might not want to send the images in full size because the .@@ k@@ im File otherwise would be very big . here you can tell the size by saying that each image is at most 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the Settings menu , you will import &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in .
the wiz@@ ard for Im@@ porting consists of four steps . first , you need to select which images you want to import , then to which folder will import images to be copied .
it can be that you person@@ alize the category of persons who is imported into the category ( if you are a domain name ) while this category is in the third dialogue window , which categories that are imported into the file and which categories that are imported into your database .
in the fourth step you can import the categories of the imported file using the categories of your current database . an example for this can be seen on the picture .
it has to be easy to browse images and watch : when you see images , you would like to see photos of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your boyfriend , you might want to see all the images on which this friend is pic@@ tured .
this manual contains the various steps of ( 1 ) Cre@@ ating the information about your pictures , via ( 2 ) the passage and view , to ( 3 ) advanced themes and adap@@ t@@ ability to work .
K@@ Photo@@ album was started as a program for managing your pictures . but it has been extended and today it also takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual are spoken about pictures , but frequently , this also includes videos with one .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; saves all its information in the file inde@@ .x@@ ml in the top folder of their images . this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. normal locking tools , copying them on a flo@@ ppy disk or re@@ visions at CV@@ S , where they would like .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; re@@ notes the folder where your pictures are saved and used this at future Star@@ ts . if you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so you can start another folder of folder with images , you can start the -@@ c . as example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / Company / Images / index@@ .x@@ ml .
via the menu entry settings k@@ photo@@ album ; set up a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the following section of the user &apos;s guide will be explained to you the different settings options .
&quot; &quot; &quot; links you can see six different symbols , with which you can access settings and options for the viewer . for each setting there is a detailed help you can access to the F1 key and select a click on the desired option . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was described as you describe for every picture of different properties , e.g. individuals , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups like items , animals or albums .
to see the dialog , which is used to process existing groups . for each existing group you can choose a label and a symbol .
in the section sub@@ categories were already mentioned . in the dialog options you can set up all members of the members , e.g. all members of a group at once in a group organize than all groups of a medi@@ ed as in explained .
in view the settings options available to you are available for the fixed listing of the members . with the above listing list , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left pane , a list of the current category and in the right is a list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; shares its modular system with other graphic applications such as digi@@ tised and G@@ wen@@ view . this modular system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plugin Interface . nutrition information on this can be found on the homepage of Ki@@ pi .
the modules can be called by the menu modules . the modules can and will not be described in this manual since they are not part of &amp; c@@ photo@@ album ; but are separately sold . most modules have a help page that you can access over the modules itself .
since the modules can be used together with each other , it can be that the modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it should always be very little tested using the demo database before you use them on your own pictures . the demo database can either call on the command line with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or via the menu Help . do not say I would not have war@@ ned !
the applications that use the modules regarding K@@ IP@@ I are very different , which means it may be that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not work . this is the disadvantage if you share functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications that also apply to K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications can not support their pictures in albums . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this kind of order does not support , sim@@ ulates it for some modules the order by albums , so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ;
this sim@@ ulates &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which simply corresponds to the current view , so all images that shows you the picture shows at the moment .
in addition to the current album &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , the modules also has to be handed over a list of albums . here , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as follows :
if &amp; pic@@ photo@@ album ; s browser displays the contents of a category , for example all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module .
or it will have the category that you have set in dialog as a category for virtual albums . for example , if you want to use the category people , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so do you have chosen persons to the view and pass this on the module .
since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not compatible can you remove them from the list of modules . start the dialog dialog and select the modules that you want to load modules .
on the picture you can see an example of a start@@ image screen as soon as you start your photo album ; starting with your own pictures .
as you &apos;re used to use it from any other KDE application , you will see quite a menu navigation - and a toolbar . at the moment , you will find no information about your pictures , then click on this window , then click on the entry image to show you an overview of all available images .
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to see each image with ann@@ ot@@ ations , where the image was recorded , etc. you can bet each image either individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time . if for example on all pictures is jes@@ per pic@@ tured and all pictures were recorded in Copenhagen .
all these comments can be used for the Brow@@ se and browsing , as you can read in the section . if you want to see these notes if you are using the built @-@ in viewer .
in view three lists of a text box by setting people , places and keywords , these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; because you will always use them again when you enter information about your pictures .
the following idea is to push the pictures within the list : if you have a family party and have formed the same 5 @-@ 10 persons on all 50 pictures , so that the names of the names are moved upwards to find the people faster and arrange .
if you prefer to see a alphabe@@ tical list , click on the icon for s@@ orting by date below the list .
if you have selected any comments on each picture individually , you might want to edit all the selected images and provide these images with ann@@ ot@@ ations . simply click on the front and back buttons that are placed under the preview of the image to the right .
if you have multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more comfortable to mark all these images and to use the menu item multiple entries at one time with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California all lie in the USA . furthermore , San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California .
on the picture you will see a browser window of the USA as an over@@ group . to show you that it is an over@@ group , a special symbol is displayed .
in the context menu of the comments dial@@ ogs , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over@@ - or sub@@ category . in addition , you can also create an entry into a category and lay down in order to do this one sub@@ category of this entry . caution , this pres@@ upp@@ oses that you just sort your categories alphabe@@ tically . see that .
you can move the individual elements of the comments dial@@ ogs by form the bar , which form the upper edge of the frame , click and post@@ p@@ one . you can make a single window by selecting it outside the window range .
if you have adapted the look of the window to your needs , you will be satisfied with the settings , click on the button options ... which gives you the possibility to save the current setup and appearance of the window .
you can also use a frame completely out . if you want to display this window later , use the button Options ... and then window a / hide . this process can be seen in the picture .
if you choose the display images in your browser , you get an overview with preview images of the currently selected pictures , or all pictures if you have no filter . you can configure the size of the th@@ umb@@ nails , by simply drag the mouse button with the middle mouse button . try it easily .
if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this picture is decorated as wallpaper for your desktop .
once you click on an image , this displayed in the picture section . if you have not opened a window with a photograph , a new sco@@ re@@ ster will be created .
you can also delete pictures in the picture list . simply select the appropriate images from which you want to delete , or select either the Edit button or select Edit menu . now you can see the window you can see in the picture .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can also use the pictures without which you have stored on the hard drive . of course you have to record the pictures anywhere , so that the images can be downloaded from the disk . in the picture you see the view from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required images can be loaded from the hard drive .
pictures , in which the right upper corner is cut , are not stored on the hard disk . however , for example 5 @-@ 9 , however , the th@@ umb@@ nails are present , so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , you can view the preview of these images , however these pictures may not look at the image .
as you can see , this feature does not need to copy files from folders and again . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it does not support you to avoid the inser@@ tion of the question . in case you do not want to avoid the penetration of your images , please buy a larger disk to store all images on it .
in the menu images you will find a sub@@ menu with the name of privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , please filter the images that you may want to un@@ accessible for others and click App@@ ly View images , which may see your little sister , inf@@ eu@@ vers and the menu entry .
this allows you to specify which images in case of the case should be hidden from your little sister , so you simply select the menu entry pictures , elimin@@ ating all the images that you &apos;re locked . if you want to see the pictures again , click D@@ erre .
it is also possible to specify a password that must be entered into the pictures to un@@ lock the pictures . to adjust this password , simply select password in the menu of privacy .
please consider that this picture protection is not very safe at all . you can access all images on the hard disk and anyone who can access the file inde@@ .x@@ ml , password as un@@ encrypted text only serves to those who deal with &amp; c@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar to honor the view of private pictures .
the reason why you manage all your images with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and of course you want to spend hours over hours with it , of course , that you want to look at some sometime . for this reason it has a picture _ and video @-@ viewed . this allows you to run out of preview , as described in .
the viewer can see in . it shows of course the picture , but extra any information you have to enter the image like e.g. who is on the picture , when and where it was done , etc .
if the Inf@@ obo@@ x on the upper part of the picture you want to see , you can also configure this easily with the mouse and elsewhere . all these options are shown at all . all these options are available after a right @-@ click on the viewer . the following context menu allows you to see below .
some words in the Inf@@ obo@@ x are under@@ lined . if you click here , see the right items to display . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had chosen persons from the browser and then Anne H@@ ene .
if you have loaded several pictures in the viewer , you can switch between them and go back by using the buttons picture high and picture . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ si@@ one and end . these features are also accessible from the context menu .
if multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can leave this as a slideshow . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then a new picture invites you by pressing the C@@ trl key and Plus or minus . started and stopped the slideshow through the C@@ trl key ; S .
a very useful ability of the be@@ holder of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it is used in full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete place on the screen . simply use the entry button to switch in full screen mode and back .
when you use the viewer , you can move into the image and perform zo@@ oming . with the minus button you can re@@ zoom into the middle of the picture . as a zoom button is checked in the middle of the picture and shows the result of the zoom .
with the point button you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not displayed as zo@@ omed , so that each pixel is in the screen of the image .
notice that the only Zo@@ om@@ oper@@ ations are working in videos that are now in and zo@@ oming with the Plus@@ - and Min@@ u@@ key .
with the fil@@ ming from the context menu you can rot@@ ate the image . this does not work with videos . you can make notes to the current picture with the menu item remarks from the context menu .
if you can see pictures it may happen , that you will find a picture with a person whose name you will have forgotten on the image . in the moment you can preview the inter@@ ruption and configuration dialog of the picture to view this name . however , you &apos;ll perhaps prefer to mark the picture and view more images .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the images on paper . to see which photos you want to start the viewer with the images and select it as good or bad , while you look at one by one .
for the two examples above gives you the viewer to provide images with characteristics , while you look at them . characteristics are the letter A to Z and you can put a feature by pressing the corresponding letter . in view of the features A , B and C are set .
once you have set features on your pictures , they are available in your browser . so you can see all the images you want to print , print or whatever you choose . afterwards , you can use a module to copy the selected images on a CD or what you just want to do .
categories and particular features can be displayed in the preview view . if you add categories to the images , then you can press attributes to the pictures by clicking the letter for the feature , after the picture was selected . this can be seen here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . in this case you will be able to paint the photographs on the picture .
the tune will not be saved with the image but in the database . in the way you can move your gem@@ s later .
in addition , you can see an image at the painted picture . in order to turn off the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; take off on the picture painting from the context menu . to finish the fire below , simply press the cross in the toolbar icon at the top of the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; do not have to control the application of the program &amp; Pov@@ ray ; not fully rule , but the documentation on &amp; Pov@@ ray ; should you absolutely read and understood .
in the object of the object , you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object in the wire mod@@ ell@@ - views yellow .
you can also select multiple objects simultaneously . but not the under@@ object of one already selected object , as all the objects already are selected using the object .
to insert a new object in the Object of the Object , select the item you want to insert the object and either click on the icon in the toolbar or select a menu entry in the menu inser@@ tion .
if there are m@@ eh@@ re possible positions , the following un@@ folding menu appears , so that you can choose the correct position :
with Del@@ eting , either from the menu bar , using Edit or from the context menu of the right mouse button , you can select previously selected objects from the scene .
if you have changed features , click here to apply these changes . you have given invali@@ d values , a message will be displayed with a description of the error , then click on the input errors and then click on the changes to break down .
when you enter the path to &amp; Pov@@ ray ; user documentation in the dialog dialog , you can call the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; reference to the indicated object with help .
you need the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this property . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download them here . &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.5 contains the user documentation .
if you edit a text or part of a text , you can see a preview in the property view .
press the preview in the property view and a small example of the scene is hin@@ dered with the chosen text box . as default , the entire texture is selected , even if you want to ren@@ dering an element within a text map ( for example , a text box within a text map ) and not the entire texture map ) , cross local text .
the screen@@ shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these check@@ points with the mouse and thereby change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is elected , the check@@ points will disappear and there will be a small cross in the wi@@ re@@ location view . this cross marks the centre of sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shi@@ fts . you can change the shift by drag@@ ging with the mouse inside the entire window .
each object has a lens level of visibility . you can indicate this value relative to the visibility of the higher object or as absolute value . objects are only displayed when they are selected or their view of view of small or equal in the toolbar of the scene .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; has a user interface as pres@@ etting . the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
if you do not like the default window , or if you need another arrangement , you can save them any number . you can also save multiple windows regulations and easily change between different arrangements .
to anchor a window above or under a present view , drag the start to the top or bottom of a view . a rectang@@ le shows the new position .
to create a new column , drag the start to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then ancho@@ red on the right or left side of this view and extends over the overall height .
if you want to arrange several views on each other , draw the start of water in the middle of another view . you can then switch between views by clicking on the cart@@ on @-@ card above in the views .
the last possible window rules are p@@ ending views : views that are not ancho@@ red in the main window . in order to rede@@ em a view from the anch@@ oring , drag the start to the desktop or click on the small to the left at the top arrow in the coll@@ ar bar .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the sei@@ z@@ row . to prevent the window , click on the small square between arrow and cross .
you can insert additional pictures into the main window . in the menu you will find entries for each type of views . new views are sh@@ ell@@ end , you can anchor it on any point .
the current window allows you to save window rules and save it . there is a dialog displayed in which you can save the window @-@ order under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can ren@@ dering them . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; uses &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for ren@@ dering , this program has to be correctly installed . this version was written in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; version 1.0 is not supported .
to ren@@ dering the current scene , click on the icon ren@@ ders The symbol ren@@ ders in the toolbar or select the menu entry view scene ren@@ dering .
a R@@ ender mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; Pov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of ren@@ dering . if you want to insert a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert any number of R@@ ender Mo@@ di , from a fast preview up to full images in the highest quality .
if you click on the icon The R@@ ender settings in the toolbar or in the menu View R@@ ender Mo@@ di ... select the following dialogue will be opened :
each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it is a name that can be recognized the characteristics of the mode .
in the box size , you can enter the width and height of the framed picture . if you want just to ren@@ dering a small area of the image , choose the belt area and give the picture @-@ cut to ren@@ ders into the input fields .
in combination with quality , you can select the properties that uses &amp; Pov@@ ray ; for ren@@ ders . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user reflection . a detailed description of the R@@ ender features can be found in the user &apos;s manual &amp; Pov@@ ray .
if a picture is bor@@ dered with just one Stra@@ igh@@ ten pixel , you can create various bugs . these images often have a mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or bow@@ ed effects in cur@@ ves and lines , sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called Ali@@ asing .
V@@ Pov@@ ray ; uses a technique called Anti @-@ Ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of this error . generally , images are better seen using this property .
when you turn off the anti @-@ ali@@ asing , and connects &amp; Pov@@ ray ; more than one ray of the pixels . this technique is called super @-@ sampling .
&amp; Pov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because the super @-@ sampling is adapted to the neighboring pixels . the second method is adap@@ tive @-@ recur@@ sively ; re@@ cur@@ si@@ v , because every Pixel is always separated , and adap@@ tive because the record depth depends on the calculated colours .
if you choose the first method then POV @-@ Ray one Stra@@ hl more pixels . if the difference between the colours to the neigh@@ bou@@ red pixels have been processed , then both pixels by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you calculate the low value of 4 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
diff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 beams per pixel . if the difference between the values passed the pre@@ valent thres@@ hold , then the pixel are classified into 4 sub@@ pixel that are individually further monitored and checked for further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the Rek@@ ur@@ sion can be set up with its lowest value .
another way to decrease the Ali@@ asing effect is the generation of smoking for the beam process , called j@@ itter@@ ing . if you turn on j@@ itter@@ ing , altered &amp; Pov@@ ray ; the blast@@ ing for a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for quality of the ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use Refl@@ ection . this is an experimental property of &amp; Pov@@ ray ; the diff@@ use light reflection . it takes very long to be able to calculate a scene using this property .
on this map , you can specify whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixels is then transparent when the associated beams have no object to be made .
opens a new window for displaying the &amp; Pov@@ ray . if &amp; Pov@@ ray is completed . if &amp; Pov@@ ray is finished , you can find the reason for this here .
to import a &amp; Pov@@ ray ; select the menu entry file Im@@ porting ... and choose a file in the dialog box .
currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; not yet the complete command line of &amp; Pov@@ ray ; . if res@@ orting messages or warning messages , a dialog window shows a list of all messages .
if you are not supported source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; then write this source code among the two special comments / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ End .
you can draw objects from the object @-@ tree in the editor to import the source code for &amp; Pov@@ ray . this adds the source code of the object into the opened text file in the editor , highlight the source code in the editor and drag it to the text tree .
with copying and paste into &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; and in your editor you can insert source code for &amp; Pov@@ ray . also .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called if &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; a scene ren@@ dering . usually this Pov@@ ray or x @-@ Pov@@ ray .
if you click on help in the property view , opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; the text document displayed here . Set here the path to your documentation and the version . supported the versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; Pov@@ ray ; looking for external files ( for example height field ) in the paths to the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you also need to enter the path to those files here . if a file occurs in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for viewing the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for viewing the selected control points .
the color of the rectang@@ le for the field of view in the camera view and in the window @-@ type identi@@ fies .
you can set the object @-@ cat@@ ching of points to the re@@ aster in the context menu of the wire @-@ off views . you can adjust here the re@@ aster separated for shi@@ fts , sc@@ aling , and rotation .
larger values result in an exact wi@@ c@@ age model , and therefore a better approach for the indicated objects , but require more time to ren@@ dering . for some objects such as the ball , you can adjust the detailed instruction for two directions .
when you cross the High Detailed view for advanced proj@@ ections , all wi@@ re@@ visions are further divided , when the camera uses an extended projection . advanced proj@@ ections are all proj@@ ections with exceptions to the perspective and sens@@ ed proj@@ ections . this property gives better approach for proj@@ ections , but requires more time to ren@@ dering .
when you see walls , a wall is rounded behind the objects . the wall is represented in a ch@@ ecker @-@ board pattern of two adjustable colors .
when you cros@@ ses soil is displayed a floor below the objects . the floor is represented in a ch@@ ecker @-@ board pattern of two adjustable colors .
if you tick the cant@@ on , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for ren@@ ders of the scenes . the values for depth and tail value can you adjust . more precise information about parameters can be found in section R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di .
on this page you can change existing window arrangements or create new window arrangements . in the section window regulations , how you can create window orders and save it .
the Com@@ bin@@ ary Single @-@ toler@@ ances : displays all existing windows . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; uses the selected window orders when starting the program .
the list of existing windows regulations shows all existing windows . a new arrangement may create you with the button Add and delete a selected arrangement with the button del@@ ta .
each window rules will be identified by the name . the name must be clear and may not be empty .
the list below shows all views of the selected window orders . new views can be deleted using the button Add and select selected views with the button del@@ ta .
the position of the new window . with New column create a new column on the right side of the available windows , with box map you will receive a cart@@ on view together with the previous view and sh@@ utter that view not in the main window , but generates a separate window .
so you have just been installed &amp; Pov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; installed and now you want to follow more precise knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should create the ultimate bl@@ iss@@ ant but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a sphere on a level .
but you should carefully consider the following war@@ nings , before you complain that you will receive as a result only a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules :
if you are not set any camera , no rules can be applied to ren@@ ders as a result you get a black picture .
if you want to insert no light sources , your entire scene is in the dark and you only get a black picture .
if you have all faul@@ t@@ less installed , you can see at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; the following pres@@ et window order :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of the toolbar . read the documentation so you can expect a proper idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols frequently , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you must first remove all objects from the object @-@ tree . highlight the scene and then select the menu entry . now you have a scene without objects .
the wi@@ re@@ line view shows how the camera sees the whole scene that you generate . especially notice the scene from the point of view of the camera . this shows you the result of the ren@@ der@@ ns of the scene .
the Object Tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you can find the content of the Object Ob@@ jects , in which the various parameters of the camera can be found . in the user &apos;s documentation to &amp; Pov@@ ray you will find more details .
change nothing to the basic settings of the camera , this is later instructions reserved , but notice the camera in view check@@ points with which you can change the way@@ point of the camera . just click with the left mouse button on a counter point and drag it to the desired place .
if you apply the button button or press the input button , the wire rope @-@ views and the object @-@ tree will immediately change according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the point of view of the camera .
there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . you could for example insert a qu@@ ader ( inser@@ ting body qu@@ ader ) and the size on x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but that &apos;s a conc@@ ise method for solving this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; actually offers an easy way . you can use an infinite level as a floor :
a good advice : select the level in the object @-@ tree , change the name and then push the button button . the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wi@@ re@@ location @-@ view now also shows the level , although at the moment only the limited end level . if you ren@@ dering the scene , the level stretches up to the horizon .
if you view the object of the object , you will find that you click the entry for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation , and shift . select one of these options , also change the possible settings in the view of the object properties .
in this scene you should move the ground to exercise a unit among the sky@@ line , just to get to know some of these parameters . select shift and set values as follows :
just choose the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose something different at the moment .
in both cases a dialog box can be inserted in which you can choose how the object is inserted . please choose the name in the object view ( name = ground @-@ pigment ) , with a click on the button pre@@ views , see how the pigment looks now .
of course , the preview of pig@@ ments shows only a matt black material because you can still enter settings for pig@@ ments . do not think about the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview . do not give it many possibilities , but do you now take the sim@@ pl@@ est .
if you don &apos;t see any color on j@@ ader and ball , just click the button below and then call the preview .
the material for the ground is now correct . if you ren@@ dering your picture by clicking on the icon , you should get the following result :
of course , this will not be the color @-@ . you have expected . here are some settings necessary . in the Far@@ ben@@ list you have to enter two new attributes . then edit this entry twice ( you can also do this same , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color color can only be used with two colors ) :
select in the Object @-@ tree each and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
this step you should already perform just as you have understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; the ball is as easy as to create the ground :
in the view of the object properties , you can instantly change the settings . put the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget the input key or the button . otherwise the ball would stick over the ground , as you have moved the ground to move down a unit down .
of course , the ren@@ ders now yield a strange result : as already before see before , the ball @-@ surface appears like a matt black material . put in the following step one of an appropriate material .
if you have selected the ball , you can now find a material now . as already in the ground , give the ball a pigment as a color :
select initial instruction and change the name for example in sphere Pig@@ ment . click the ball Pig@@ ment , select then colors and place the values as follows :
but you can reach more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties :
then change the values as shown in the following screen@@ shots and click on or press Enter .
the attitudes str@@ g@@ low effect and ré@@ l@@ exi@@ on result in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if metal : not yet selected :
you should now have a good impression of what options offer you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; and hopefully you have so much learned so that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ cing is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
if you have a scene ra@@ y@@ trac@@ en , sho@@ ots the ren@@ derer hypo@@ the@@ tical rays from the perspective of the be@@ holder ( i.e. the scenes ) describes how this beam through the objects is reflected and broken , the visual effects of light sources into the scene and how is atmosph@@ eric effects like for example fo@@ g . so the scene is processed for pixels .
as you can imagine , you will see nothing without a camera , the camera is your eye , with which you see the scene . without a light source you also see nothing , the image is simply black . obviously needs every scene that should be le@@ ased , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog you can select your file . Pov@@ ray files usually have the extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the standard file dialog you can select a file that you have created before with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted in this sub @-@ menu and re@@ places the oldest entry in the list .
if you already saved the model , it is stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you must enter a name and disk space .
imagine the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage will be rejected .
this menu entry can only be selected if you do not yet stored changes in the scene .
repeated the most recently back@@ accessible command . this menu entry can only then select if you have used editing .
save the current window rules and opens a dialog box where you enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing arrangement .
in this menu you will find options for setting up &amp; c@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; here you can change the look , the keyboard short@@ cut and the standard .
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can change with this option pres@@ et short @-@ seat for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; commands change or new .
opens a dialog to set up the tool system . you can add and remove computers with this option @-@ icons for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ;
a b@@ ump map is a way to smo@@ ked surfaces without any beats on the surface individually mod@@ elling and without change the geomet@@ ric shape of the object itself .
it is custom@@ ary to use the same file for both a B@@ ump map as well as a texture map .
fundament@@ als are simple geomet@@ rical forms that you can use as a building blocks : very complex 3D models are generated from do@@ zens or even hundreds of this basic body . these models are then further processed to give them a realistic appearance .
a texture map is a way to specify the surface of an object color on a pixel base , by using a picture file as a colour map .
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a comfortable image reference and browser . the application has a file browser , in which you can choose images to display .
images can either be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can see with clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the key will display .
you can specify if any image is displayed in a separate window or if all pictures should always use the same window .
if you are searching for a specific file , you simply tap the first characters of the fil@@ ename in the browser window . then a small entry box was found in the right bottom corner . if a suitable fil@@ ename is found , the file is highlighted . you can leave the input field by wi@@ gs of return or &amp; Es@@ c ;
in the dialog box - &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; there are five cards . in three of them , General and editing and slideshow , you can adjust the working method of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the two other , short @-@ error for the browser , the keyboard short@@ cut for the respective window can be specified .
if this is selected , then the pictures will be opened in full screen mode . if the picture is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the ad surface is filled with the background color that you can further set aside . pres@@ etting is not a full screen mode .
is this point activ@@ ates , invites &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; already the next image in the folder , while you still have the current image . this reduces the delay when you choose the next picture and is particularly suitable for a slideshow .
with this option saves &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; by opening the name of the last opened folder . the next start opens &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
click on the colored bars to select a background color . this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in the window , the window is bigger than the picture , the background is filled with the selected color .
you can &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; so set that only a few of the file types can be displayed that the program can also be shown .
with this option the sco@@ re@@ ster is enlarged on the full screen . this option is turned into default .
determine whether the slideshow is to start with the first image in the folder or the selected image .
the time period between the image change at a slideshow . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the sli@@ der and the small arrows right next to the input field . the default width is 3 seconds .
the number of re@@ peti@@ tions . this value is set to 0 , the slideshow is repeated until it is broken down by the user . to change the value , you can use a new value in the input field or use the sli@@ der and the small arrows right next to the input field .
change the button short@@ cut for the different modes of operation of &amp; cu@@ ick@@ show ; in the box @-@ cards short @-@ show for the sco@@ re@@ ster and short @-@ command for the browser .
with this option , you turn off between the two @-@ part view of the fil@@ es@@ ystem ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in a window .
displays big symbols for files in the folder . this display is only possible in short presentation .
displays small symbols for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in short presentation .
displays th@@ umb@@ nails for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in short presentation .
reduction the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
enlarged the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .

display the image in its original size . this is only useful when automatic sc@@ aling is activated .
opens the entry field for understanding . enter the first characters of the file name you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .
&amp; show@@ foto ; is a &amp; c@@ de ; photo editing based on the &amp; digi@@ ous ; image processing . &amp; show@@ foto ; is part of &amp; digi@@ ous ; project .
&amp; show@@ foto ; is a fast editing with some powerful base tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform correc@@ tions and modifications .
as the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ foto ; an open source project . this means it depends on that the user is contributing to its part , at least problems and possible improvements .
&amp; show@@ foto ; making it as easy as possible errors or potential improvements . wherever you use it , your browser displays a page with reports of problems and wishes . all required information is filled out and you can simply follow the guide to submit your message .
&amp; show@@ foto ; is a project that is supported by a community . that means that users and developers are helping each other . if you have a common user of &amp; show@@ foto ; however , we would like to answer you questions to other users of &amp; show@@ foto . in this mail@@ ing@@ list , you should be spoken English , you should be this language therefore powerful .
the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ foto ; it is the developer mailing list to join in the developer of the developer mailing list of &amp; show@@ foto ;
&amp; show@@ foto ; try to give you so much control over his work@@ flows as possible . in order to access these settings , you have to select Settings menu show@@ room . you can switch between these settings in eight pages . you can switch between them by clicking on the symbols of the left .
in the area of exposure Ob@@ jects you can select the color that is displayed when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure indication should show the colors with what you should show , in contrast , a bright color and over@@ exposure should show a dark color .
the main window of &amp; show@@ foto ; has a page row at the right edge , which provides you with important information and actions for the selected images . you can see this display in the image processing . you can view this in which you click on one of the five hor@@ semen :
&amp; sk@@ an@@ lite ; is an application for pic@@ tu@@ bs of pictures , which no longer makes than images to scan and ab@@ sorb .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ lite ; is an easy application for pic@@ tu@@ bs of pictures , which does not make more than images to scan and ab@@ sorb the images instantly in a given folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can display the images in front of the stor@@ ing .
you can review the status of your scanner on the SAN@@ E projection page by typ@@ ing the necessary information on this search site : HTTP : / / www.@@ s@@ ane @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner may be set at the command line of &amp; sk@@ an@@ lite ; with the command sk@@ an@@ lite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner is not opened or if no standard scanner was specified , then a dialogue to choose the scanner will be opened .
the user can select the scanner and press the OK button to open the scanner . cancel &amp; sk@@ an@@ lite .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the drivers . &amp; sk@@ an@@ lite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) , these options are not particularly well .
in order to create a picture , the user can only start a pre @-@ in @-@ can and then search for scanning area for the final scan . the Pre@@ f@@ aus@@ can is started by the Pre@@ view button .
to select the image better , the user can zoom into the image and out of the current selection . he can also adjust the zoom into the window as well .
if the image was selected then the final image can be read with the scan button .
if on the stor@@ ing a preview is selected in the settings , then the image is displayed in a curtain ring , as below is displayed , then the image is saved and ver@@ lie ? en leads to a break@@ down and you will return to the main window .
the previous settings will open the dialogue before the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can see the picture , if desired , be seen before saving . in this case the option No to be chosen before saving an preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be chosen .
this setting allows them to select the type such as &amp; sk@@ an@@ lite ; images can be saved . dialogue for stor@@ ing each image open the dialog before every single defined file . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ lite it is to save them automatically with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you must select save without following a fil@@ ename .
this setting defines where the images are stored in the option without being saved to a fil@@ ename . if the images are stored after each scan , this folder will be used as default for dialogue as saving . the default value is your home directory and you can change it with the button .
this parameter defines a picture pre@@ fix for automatically re@@ mem@@ or@@ ised images and is furthermore the proposed name for the image in dialogue to save . the automatically stored image is displayed a numer@@ ical su@@ ff@@ ix of each time when a picture is stored . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user may adapt the image quality to save image quality . this value also changes the com@@ pression value when saving . if select the image quality is not selected , the default value is used by Q@@ t .
the button help starts KDE @-@ help with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ lite ; -@@ manual . the button About will the KDE About -@@ Dialog for &amp; sk@@ an@@ lite ; . the button Settings shows the dialog for the settings and shots can be used to quit &amp; sk@@ an@@ lite ;
&amp; sk@@ an@@ lite ; is licensed under the GPL and the lib@@ ks@@ ane library , used by &amp; sk@@ an@@ lite ; for : li@@ bs@@ ane is licensed under the GPL with an exception .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses like all other programs button . below you can create a list of this p@@ ac@@ zel and their function . the global keyboard short@@ cut by clicking on the Player window and setting Bell button . selecting the right mouse button in the Player window and select short notice .
you might be set to create available multimedia buttons that they work as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ short @-@ commands . therefore , make your keyboard to &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions that are mostly used in other KDE programs . this section consists of six parts and should describe the D@@ CO@@ P feature of collection , context @-@ browser , player , play@@ list , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists and scripts .
Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; . additionally , Amar@@ ok has some own command line options .
you should give the user a feedback if the script should not be executed because of missing depen@@ dency . please check in your script whether all required modules are present and use dialog , so the user pass , why a script does not run .
begin of &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Load@@ Er@@ ror error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( KDE bin@@ dings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings for v@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos;
in the folder Le@@ aders you will find a lot of template @-@ scripts in many different languages . you can use them as a base for your own scripts , or simply extend the functions required . you will quickly find that writing scripts relatively simple .
with the help of D@@ CO@@ P you can control your scripts with amar@@ ok and Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the command d@@ co@@ p ; which should support each KDE installation .
most scrip@@ ting languages enable the execute of external programs and commands . in this way , usually the function ex@@ ec ( ) can usually be called d@@ co@@ p &gt; relatively simple . here an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends noti@@ fications to all running scripts . this is why scripts used to monitor their default input and respond accordingly to events . of course , a script can also ignore the events if there is no usage for it .
configure the script to view the dialog dialog . to run the stor@@ ing and loading of the inser@@ tion data , each script should take care of yourself . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok requires the working folder on the folder where all data should be saved .
track@@ able sign@@ alizes that a new piece is played . the script should now ask for example ; using D@@ CO@@ P functions to ask more information about the new piece ( for example the met@@ adata or the rod ) .
vol@@ um@@ e@@ Change new@@ volume sign@@ alizes a change of volume . the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ men@@ u@@ cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu parti@@ tions cli@@ cked on the path to the selected files of the play@@ list , if a user @-@ defined menu item can be added . to use the script to remove the cli@@ cked entry you can use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; or if the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M sends to the script . this signal should be processed to do e.g. au@@ fr@@ aming process . for example , the saving of data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ a@@ script administration may also install script packages that can be com@@ pressed for users . such packages are basically normal tar archive ( .@@ b@@ z@@ 2 ) , which can also be com@@ pressed with b@@ zi@@ p@@ 2 ( .@@ b@@ z@@ 2 ) , so that the user can clearly determine the archive as a Amar@@ ok script package .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the Exten@@ sive strip script . for this reason , you should ren@@ ame your script packages immediately .
the main cri@@ es must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the tar parameter -@@ p to receive the file &apos;s rights :
if your script is finished , you can re@@ charge it on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wi@@ ki scripts page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; an@@ gled . for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps , you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; script .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has many useful and powerful functions and still surprisingly simple to use . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can easily drag music easily into the play@@ list instead of working through end@@ lessly menus . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos; s collecting browser and the quick search will find the piece within seconds .
maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which you want to hear ? then the play@@ list Browser is exactly the right for you . and if you decide to make the decision even difficult , choose dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically choose the right music according to certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers IF@@ P and a lot of general USB devices . furthermore , many different audio systems are able to listen to how to listen to your music . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right to re@@ experience your music !
usually , one has to enter the basic folder of the Amar@@ ok sources to compile and install Amar@@ o@@ K :
because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake , you should have not re@@ comp@@ iling any trouble . if you encounter problems , please report it in the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has like most applications some options that you can enable or dis@@ able for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; configure time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the configure script . this is a list of available options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for some of the composite options , certain depen@@ dencies need to be met so that they can be used . details about this can be found in the system requirements .
activ@@ ates Deb@@ ug@@ ging icons . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help in the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you should use full .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can be set up without effort over the set @-@ up dialog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Local dialog has multiple map @-@ cards to set up the various functions of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amar@@ ok &quot; &quot; &quot; ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
player window display the player window in addition to play@@ list one or out . if the option is off , only the play@@ list window is displayed ( J@@ K ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; voting bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the option is compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ le . the option folded the experimental function of the voting bar@@ ometer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
voting more : this feature is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ le . thus , the used color scheme is changed for the mood bar@@ ometer .
voting files in the music files : this feature is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok . if this setting is activated , .@@ Fol@@ der files are stored in the Settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; otherwise ( usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ le / ) .
external browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; Amar@@ ok should be started when a browser is needed .
use other browsers : here you can indicate the path to a different browser which is not listed in the list .
play@@ list while saving , save the current play@@ list automatically with the editing of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; activate this option if you do not want to lose the current play@@ list during loading .
relative paths for manually saved play@@ lists : if you activate this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the storage place of play@@ list , use otherwise the absolute position of the music files will be saved .
up @-@ to @-@ date pieces of the piece @-@ change can be seen that the play@@ lists are opened , in order to keep the running piece always in the invisible window range .
when changing to the context @-@ browser the context @-@ browser automatically displays the context @-@ browser as soon as the next piece is played .
in the cit@@ ys@@ cape , you can adjust &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s appearance . the section is divided into three parts .
in fon@@ ts section , you can use the use of various fon@@ ts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; otherwise you can use scripts for the following areas : play@@ list windows , player windows and context @-@ browsers . click on excer@@ pts ... so you can choose a desired font from the file dialog box .
with the selection of custom colour scheme , you own yourself the Qu@@ al of the choice and can specify a separate color scheme . use the included colours for front and background color .
reproduction when starting continue , that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after program launch , playback automatically with the play on the site , with which it was stopped at the last be@@ end .
the sub@@ window on @-@ screen display will allow you to use the switch @-@ on display of the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display is enco@@ ded , a preview of the O@@ SD will display and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview .
the first option is the font . click on select ... to select the desired font for the O@@ SD . the p@@ addle shade causes the text in the O@@ SD sh@@ aded .
own colors use the possibility to custom@@ ise the O@@ SD colors for letters and background . a click on the color areas opens the dialog for color selection . if the colors use is not activated , the pres@@ et color are used are used .
the input field display text displays the text shown in the O@@ SD . by the type of space , the O@@ SD can be adapted to your needs . below you will find a list of available posts and what they mean .
the option screen is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . this allows you to specify which screen of a multi@@ channel monitor has to appear .
the cart@@ on card audio output allows you to select a audio driver from the selection field . some drivers can activate even further settings in this map @-@ card .
the map Collection is used to set up all settings for your collection . this includes the folders and the type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folder named &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to browse through music files . to insert a folder into the collection with its name , highlight the clip in addition to its name . this section also includes quotes fields on how to select the selected folders .
sub@@ folders in short : this causes that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the crossed and their sub@@ folders will be as well as their sub@@ folders .
changes : enable &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folder on changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . furthermore , an incre@@ mental search will be carried out to make the necessary changes to your collection .
play@@ lists : causes that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; all found play@@ lists in your collecting @-@ folders ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection are added later in the play@@ list browser later .
the part of the collectors database is used for selecting a database for the collection . the combination field driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite and My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , another device is needed in the window of My@@ S@@ q@@ l .
the My@@ S@@ q@@ l setup is used for inser@@ tion of the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used by calcul@@ ator , where the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is entered . then , under Port : the network port is entered , under which the database is reachable . name : is the database name that is established .
use username and password : for entering the data required for the connection to the database .
the cart@@ ography last@@ .@@ f@@ m ensures support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of mir@@ ro@@ cked pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and if necessary music recommendations pertaining to the current piece .
here , enter your username and password for your loaded .@@ f@@ m profile . if you have no profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
b@@ undle pieces send and thus update the profile : this setting enables it &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transfer the names of the mir@@ ro@@ cked pieces to your load @-@ profile .
similar interpre@@ ters retri@@ eve : according to activ@@ ating this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a list with similar artists to be retri@@ eved in each case . you can see the list in the context @-@ browser . note : you do not need last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this function .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; eg ; Linux ) . you will find further information in the summary of features and gallery photos .
Amar@@ o@@ K needs only the package of k@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no further KDE packages . they must have K@@ deli@@ bs so installed ( including those included in it ) , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; they have written a small guide on how to compiled K@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
some features such as O@@ SD advance pre@@ di@@ ct that your window manager will present the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . G@@ NO@@ ME will thus work , but flu@@ x@@ box will support difficulties . we try to support Amar@@ o@@ on on all platforms , so we use ch@@ deli@@ bs and q@@ t because they are preparing an excellent development environment .
probably one of your files will make an error in the t@@ agli@@ b library . you can check out the file by drag@@ ging in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / amar@@ ok / collection _ scan@@ .@@ log . afterwards , you can delete the file and set the collection again .
mostly it is that t@@ agli@@ b is cr@@ ashes when reading the met@@ a @-@ Infos from this file . please report this error to the t@@ agli@@ b developers under bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , then try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; Amar@@ ok , is something mature .
make sure that all libraries used by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used libraries have been compiled with the same compiler version . if such as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with GCC 3.4 , t@@ agli@@ b , but with GCC 3.@@ 3.@@ x compiled , then leads to overthrow the met@@ a @-@ information .
if you use KDE with art@@ s@@ d , then de@@ activ@@ ating autom@@ . off if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ way by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens with a crash ) . if it is a frequent re@@ lin@@ tel and you will send us a good feedback , the error will be guaranteed .
this is the fact that many programs write data as U@@ TF @-@ 8 into the met@@ a @-@ Infos , but they do not mark as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; The $ ar@@ g@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ mp3 = MP3 / v@@ 2@@ day ; print &quot; errors in writing the tags from $ ar@@ g@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ day , amp ; U@@ TF@@ 8 ) ;
this script requires Perl @-@ module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos;@@ install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &apos;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( random / re@@ petition / dynamic play@@ list ) see in KDE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , the toolbar icons can easily be forgotten on grey and half . please note that in some cases you have to click on a symbol , until this setting displays their effect .
if you get this error : amar@@ oc@@ app : Un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ system Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then check if Amar@@ ok uses the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with LD@@ D &apos;@@ which amar@@ it@@ app &apos;s _ BAR _ gre@@ p Q@@ T .
to fix this bug , you may need to remove any label q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok finds the right version first .
there are several possibilities . most installation problems arise at the ligh@@ test by the help of an expert your Uni@@ x@@ - or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or with the developers . use this forum and IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ de@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ ok .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please enter there only one mistake , if you are a little bit of a bug in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; appears merely a blank play@@ list . how do things come from there now ?
that &apos;s easy . use the file system on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the play@@ list .
to keep the surface intuitive , the start window into the Statistics window has been converted . you will find it under the following statistics .
the significance of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for the assessment by the user , while the points will be automatically generated .
to evaluate pieces , have to be displayed in the play@@ list , click on the list of re @-@ list and select a column . click somewhere in the new review column to use the rating for a piece . you can also use the dumb@@ bell run Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works when Amar@@ o@@ K is in the background .
select the files you want to remove and then click your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your choice and then choose from the play@@ list from the drop @-@ down menu .
drag a play@@ list file with your mouse into the play@@ list and let them fall there as you would make it with other files too . so simple is that : - )
in the toolbar of the play@@ list , right next to the add @-@ button , you can save the button play@@ list . click on it .
pres@@ um@@ ably l@@ acks the program x@@ m@@ ms @-@ config . install the package x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . look even after lib@@ visual , this package contains a lot of very nice visu@@ al@@ isations .
the equ@@ ali@@ zer can be reached in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . in addition , you will find him via the menu bar using E@@ quali@@ zer .
no . yes , that is true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses one of the back@@ end @-@ independent approach , therefore the actual question are supported by media files G@@ stre@@ amer / X@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we support pretty much every concei@@ vable audio format . G@@ Stream@@ er can even code text and PNG !
it may ! maybe you use Fed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which will not be supplied in the pres@@ etting ( from pat@@ ent@@ legal reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F2 , GG : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , input key
start the Ya@@ que Online update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; playing MP3 &apos; s off : - )
if you use the G@@ Stream@@ er driver with AL@@ SA @-@ S@@ ink , the device has to use a mix@@ er . a mix@@ er allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously connect audio mix@@ er ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for AL@@ SA ( software mix@@ er ) . check out the support mix D@@ mix for AL@@ SA .
the output of this instruction should help you to search for the problem of problem and a solution . for G@@ Stream@@ er you may need to specify a different S@@ ink ( e.g. oss@@ oms ) .
this does not do that media first . you do not forget that media must first de@@ co@@ ded at AL@@ SA . G@@ Stream@@ er is for most people the best choice if you read a decade or with little over@@ head . G@@ stre@@ aming reads the file , de@@ co@@ ded it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
also X@@ M@@ MS de@@ co@@ ded the data first . G@@ Stream@@ er can spend directly to AL@@ SA as well as X@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stream@@ er driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . Open check@@ box Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable Sound@@ Server with highest possible priority ( real time ) and increase the size of sound buffer ( warning , see next point of FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ s@@ wr@@ ap@@ per SU@@ ID is set :
with KDE 3.@@ 2.@@ X there are problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia Co@@ dec@@ s which can cause the disturbed reproduction . read this bug report . the mag@@ ni@@ fying of sound @-@ Pu@@ ff@@ ers in your AL@@ SA re@@ direc@@ tional file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
either you do not use the Arts driver , but instead of G@@ Stream@@ er or X@@ ine , or install KDE multimedia complete to get the quicker Arts @-@ Co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc . ) .
probably you use the Arts @-@ drivers . use another driver ( the X@@ ine @-@ driver was optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or reduce the size of the Arts buffer in control center and sound &amp; multimedia sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less agreements react to visu@@ al@@ isations . yes , this is an error , please help us resolve it .
G@@ Stream@@ er is installed , but when I want to switch to the G@@ Stream@@ er driver , cr@@ ashes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; off . why ?
after installing G@@ Stream@@ er you need to register all components . perform G@@ ST register to register all G@@ Stream@@ er components .
read the G@@ Stream@@ er FAQ . if this does not help you can also ask at IR@@ C @-@ channel # g@@ stre@@ amer .
try this ( exit Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . perform the module folder of G@@ Stream@@ er all ff@@ m@@ peg files ( you will find the module folders with G@@ ST @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run G@@ ST @-@ Register again . start now &amp; Amar@@ ok ;
please report it on bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de@@ .@@ org@@ . if you have a complete list of suggestions and desires , please send them best to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ s@@ our@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album by the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very much and find that the name sounds good . besides , the name contains the magical K ... : )
thanks to D@@ CO@@ P this is already possible . place in your calendar program an alarm and release with the alarm to execute this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ o@@ player play
this command allows &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; make sure to start playing . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; running before you go to bed , then you will have awak@@ ened by the gentle sounds of the music that you stopped before bed .
how can I find the current title in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; current titles , if one is on another computer ?
when a functional SSH environment is available , you can proceed as follows . diesel command gives you interpre@@ t and title of the running piece : SSH -@@ I ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ user amar@@ ok player now@@ Play@@ ing
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this pres@@ upp@@ oses that your identification in the file ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa is present .
the visu@@ al@@ isations can be separated from &quot; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ window . press on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer will open in an independent , in the size variable windows .
the combination of str@@ aps and right mouse button will insert a piece in the cliff viewing into the qu@@ eue . through pressing the n@@ abe@@ ar search for a search in the play@@ list , the first search results will be played and the search is reset .
OK , the player window and the play@@ list have tri@@ ck@@ rich features , but what about the icon in the system section of the control panel ?
click with &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; on the title of a browser . in the context menu you can select which browser will be shown .
my personal folder $ HOME is on a NFS drive . after starting from Amar@@ ok , the collection database may not be created and on the console release many messages . what now ?
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you will need ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / amar@@ ok on a local drive or use amar@@ o@@ K@@ s MySQL support .
insert the CD , then click on Audio @-@ CD . it opens a file browser with multiple folders . jump in the wa@@ v folder , choose a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a con@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic en@@ code , you instead take files from the folders mp3 or og@@ g .

basically , this fits the previous assessment with a dimin@@ ishing value , based on how often the play was played . the more often the play has been played , the less influence each individual rating on the overall result .
you can enter the evaluation for a piece of yourself by clicking on a column trans@@ cript in the play@@ list window . then you can select the evaluation of an item just like all the other attributes , namely by clicking on the piece of mouse button and Edit the review . you can edit the evaluation also in dialogue met@@ adata .
the developers do not wish to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok if you have a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : KDE packages have a fixed map plan of not working with the short @-@ term plan of Amar@@ ok .
this is a new feature in Amar@@ ok that some users can certainly also find anno@@ ying . dis@@ able the option symbol to play animated in the general settings .
the Analy@@ zer is part of the toolbar . select settings toolbar and take the desired changes .
download a design , or create a own . install this then under Amar@@ ok . appearance context @-@ browser design , click on new design ...
the symbol was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) similar to difficulties . to avoid difficulties , it was removed .
Kon@@ quer@@ ors Navigation area offers you the monitoring and control of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; while you browse through Kon@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 for the navigation area . click on the button Settings ( the top ) and select &quot; Add A@@ id &quot; button .
Audi@@ os@@ cro@@ ch@@ bler is a free service to which information is sent on an independent server . the service is free of charge and you need only a free username and a password . Audi@@ os@@ cro@@ chi@@ bler is fully supported by &amp; Amar@@ ok .
if you want to use AL@@ SA then the latest available version . old AL@@ SA releases have a lot of waste and thus also a lot of bug@@ fixes .
probably &amp; Amar@@ ok has been compiled , compiled before you have X@@ ine or g@@ stre@@ amer installed . therefore , the / configure routine will not compile this output modules . you need to configure and install Amar@@ ok .
now I have &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new installed , but the output modules are still not published . and now ?
pres@@ um@@ ably use a distribution which is installed separate from the actual program . although G@@ Stream@@ er is installed , the necessary development files are installed . you must now install X@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that , you must re@@ compile and install X@@ ine ; again .
I consider the error G@@ Stream@@ er Cri@@ tical * * : Factory for &apos; ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How can I fix it ?
your version of G@@ Stream@@ er has been compiled with pre@@ views , that is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stream@@ er . you need to compile G@@ Stream@@ er without pre@@ views . a tip of Mer@@ lin @-@ TC : use no LD@@ FLA@@ GS when you compile Amar@@ ok .
I get the error of There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype au@@ dia / MP4 , although the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed .
to play MP4 or M4@@ A files with G@@ Stream@@ er , must be installed next to g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad also the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time .
you will receive the fault There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
you play an MP3 stream , but the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ mad is not installed . install the module and then run as System@@ ver@@ wal@@ ter G@@ ST @-@ register . then you start amar@@ ok again .
I have a second sound@@ card and use AL@@ SA . how can with Amar@@ ok use the second sound@@ card ?
under settings Amar@@ ok , create audio output , enter the device . typical is for example h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here you can see an example for ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with a on@@ board AC@@ 97 @-@ co@@ dec and a USB audio device :

type in the field dialog from X@@ ine now us@@ b @-@ audio , and the output is done on the USB sound@@ card . so @-@ lib takes care of the conversion of the scan@@ rate , channels and so on ) .
if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , you dis@@ able the tick on sound@@ card supports m@@ map .
sorry , but the audio output with Arts will not go further . you may of course take this problem yourself into your hand ! if you want you can make the new so urgently needed super@@ visor for Arts : )
listening to music should be quite simple ! for this reason , there is the introduction assistant , who is displayed at first start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if you don &apos;t like to update your collection , then this quick start @-@ up guide should be a help . with their help you will have set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in a few minutes .
creating a play@@ list is very easy . drag and drop your mouse entries from the collecting browser into the play@@ list . if you are searching with the play@@ list , you can save them using the play@@ list , you can save them with the help of the button play@@ list below . you will find this button in the toolbar button in the play@@ list of the play@@ list window .
if you have own play@@ lists , you can add them to the play@@ list below . press this play@@ list in the folder of your collection , then you &apos;ll find this play@@ list already in a play@@ list . with a right @-@ click on a play@@ list you will receive various possibilities , as the play@@ list should be loaded .
to play an audio CD player , select in the menu bar please insert actions audio @-@ CD . it opens a file browser with multiple folders and the CD stor@@ ks in WAV format . drag the WAV files to the play@@ list and then push the button playback .
the audio CD @-@ feature uses the protocol audi@@ oc@@ d : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .
the Burn @-@ function also exists in the play@@ list . just click with the right mouse button on one entry and follow the Burn menu . you can see different options for burning a CD .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; Set the installation of some software packages . the required packages are listed below . in addition , some additional packages are listed below , which make working with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; more comfortable .
if you install these packages via a package management system ( e.g. RPM or ap@@ t ) , you must also install the development versions of these packages !
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . however , a player window with the most important functions . additionally , a play@@ list , which is superior to all others . the play@@ list window contains several browsers , with which you can capture your entire music collection and search .
in this chapter , explains how all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok , are used , including creating a collection and play@@ list .
the player window is your One @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center . at the top of the window there is a drive text display that displays the current running time , bit@@ rate and sam@@ pl@@ er@@ ate of the current piece . a click on this area changes the display of the time expi@@ red for the remaining time of the piece .
furthermore , the player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ zers , also under the drive text display . you can switch through the available analy@@ zer by clicking on the left mouse button .
the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer is displayed in an independent , enlarged window .
under the drive text you &apos;ll find the buttons PL and E@@ Q . the button PL enabled or dis@@ ables the play@@ list window , used during the button E@@ Q to set E@@ quali@@ zer .
the rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons , volume control and the piece @-@ position sli@@ ders . use the sli@@ ders to adjust the piece position or the volume . with the playback buttons you can start the playback / stop and move to the next or previous piece .
the use of the built @-@ in E@@ quali@@ zer is simple and works with all audi@@ ot@@ ters . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from classical to Tech@@ no , and you can easily create own preferences .
to view the E@@ quali@@ zer you can use extras E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click on the button E@@ Q in the Player window . once you mark the rout@@ e@@ zer E@@ quali@@ zer , the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in operation .
the play@@ list of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most advanced re @-@ list of all for &amp; k@@ de ; available multimedia player . it has many features that do not exist in any other player . but let yourself be deter@@ red from the full@@ ness of functions , they are all easy to use .
the play@@ list window can be divided into two main areas , on the left is the navigation system . in the navigation area , you will find some of the excellent functions of play@@ list , such as the context @-@ browser . on the right you can use the play@@ list itself . the play@@ list is easy to use and still for advanced users powerful enough .
the context @-@ browser displays various information regarding the current piece . its appearance can be adapted with the help of context @-@ browser design . the context @-@ browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , text and interpre@@ t . this three sub@@ windows are later de@@ fi@@ red in detail . they provide information on the current piece with different aspects .
if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; perhaps you might think that the under@@ window will be taken away . the information presented here are now distributed in other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok . furthermore , the information can be collected in the statisti@@ c window ( extras statistics ) .
the sub@@ window will show information about the straight running piece , as well as the per@@ former and the album .
the first section in this sub @-@ window shows information about the piece . in the title there is the name of the piece , interpre@@ t and the album . below you can see the cover @-@ picture of the album and next to it a musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . click on this icon to em@@ ulate the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database .
below the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon you will find more information about the current piece . you can see here , how often and when the play was played for the first and last time as well as its rating .
to display cover pictures in the context @-@ browser , the cover pictures must be placed in the same folder as the current piece . the file form@@ ate .jpg , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ gi@@ f and .@@ pn@@ g are supported . the context @-@ browser will also display cover pictures , which have been downloaded either with the cover management or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v2 @-@ tag .
the next section , Recommen@@ ded pieces , lists several recommended pieces on . if you click on one of these pieces , it will immediately be played out .
among the recommended ones are the favorite pieces from this interpre@@ ter . this area shows the five highest @-@ rated pieces of the current interpre@@ ter .
you can adjust which information in the music window should be displayed . click with the right mouse button somewhere in the window and select from the context menu .
the last section , albums of the interpre@@ ter , lists all albums of the current interpre@@ ter that you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will open and you will see the content of the album .
you can click on all the pieces in the single areas to immediately start playing with the playback . you can also click with the right mouse button on it and then choose one of the options to add one of the pieces or albums for play@@ list .
in the under@@ window text is displayed the downloaded lyrics for the current piece . this feature is very flexible and it is possible to download with the scripts written from other websites . if you are running on the text window , try to download the text for the piece from the Internet . if not yet no text script , you can choose which should be started .
the button Edit allows you to edit the lyrics . the changed version will then be stored in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s the conversion database . it is not a running text required .
the button Su@@ chen opens a search on google.com after the lyrics for the running piece ( in an external browser window ) .
group@@ ing per@@ former - group@@ ed only the highest level , each piece is displayed directly below the interpre@@ ter . albums or gen@@ res are being left out of it .
group interpre@@ t / album - Zu@@ only will the pieces look after the per@@ former . if you want to see compositions or sound@@ track albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are shown at the beginning of the list under different interpre@@ ters .
group interpre@@ t / year - Album - S@@ orted to interpre@@ t and then after year of album in desc@@ ending order ( the latest first ) . if the year for an album is unknown , the standard is 0 - Alb@@ um@@ name related .
group@@ ing album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabe@@ tically sorted each other . the per@@ former will be ignored .
group@@ ing genre / Interpre@@ t - Your pieces are first sorted by genre and below to interpre@@ t .
group@@ ing genre / Interpre@@ t / Album - This setting works just as the above , but will additionally still be sorted according to the album below the interpre@@ ter .
with the help of the remaining buttons you can customize the group@@ ing clearly after pop@@ ularity and combine .
with the last button you can change the settings on the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; your collection will automatically re@@ capture , once you own some pieces of folders , this could take a while .
just under the toolbar is a search filter . it beha@@ ves right in the list , as well as in the tree @-@ view . hints for using this fil@@ tering can be found in the section on the play@@ list in this manual .
under the search filter is a selection field , with whose help you can filter most recently added pieces to your collection , starting from the last 24 hours up to a year . besides , you can also select your complete collection , allowing the filter to be virtually depos@@ ited .
by clicking the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser you will receive the following possibilities .
loading - This le@@ ert the current play@@ list and adds the selected pieces in the currently valid order in the playback .
the play@@ list attached to the selected pieces of the current play@@ list . by double @-@ clicking on one entry you can reach the same effect .
pieces in qu@@ eue stop - This function adds the selected pieces into the qu@@ eue . therefore you will be played next .
as play@@ list store ... - Save the selected pieces as a play@@ list . you are asked for a name in which the list should be saved .
on Media Player - Add the pieces in the qu@@ eue for transferring to the Media Player . further details are available in the section via the Media Player Browser .
all pieces of this interpre@@ ters burn / To burn to CD - the selected pieces of K@@ 3@@ b will be sent either as data files or as an audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option will not appear .
met@@ adata ( for n pieces ) edit ... - Open the dialog for piece @-@ information and lets you change tags for one or more pieces .
( N ) move files into the tr@@ ash bin ... - Open a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
as a compilation - Select the selected album as a compilation of which it appears among different interpre@@ ters .
assem@@ bling mark@@ ings - changes as a compilation of marked album back to a normal album . the album is not visible under different interpre@@ ters but again below the per@@ former interpre@@ ters .
the play@@ lists browser styl@@ ed the handling of many play@@ lists is very simple . among other things it also includes Int@@ elli@@ gent play@@ lists .
the lower part of the play@@ list @-@ browser contains the smart play@@ lists . these use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists for running time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a play@@ list with the gaps in your collection that have never been played .
even even provided Int@@ elli@@ gent play@@ lists are possible . click on Int@@ elli@@ gent play@@ list to open the dialog to create a new Int@@ elli@@ gent play@@ list . there you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new play@@ list .
the sub@@ window media player is used for the connection of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for example , it is used to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for example , it must be mounted before starting from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod . if &amp; Amar@@ ok , you will find the pieces on your iPod to interpre@@ t sorted in the top list of the Media Player browser .
to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the play@@ list and let them fall on the list , click App@@ ly . therefore , the pieces will be loaded onto your iPod . when the transfer is completed , stop &amp; Amar@@ ok ; and rede@@ em the drive binding for your iPod .
under the toolbar , there is a search area with which you can search for a file . search is especially useful in folders with very many files because in the file list all files will be hidden , which do not match your search criteria .
in the bottom of the file @-@ browser there is a address bar , with which you can collect music from a given URL . if you are using tar : / home / Mike / musi@@ k.@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z , you can access music in the file musi@@ k.@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z . now you can drag and drop the music from there to play@@ list .
when the play@@ list is longer required than in the window , the drop files can be very difficult by easy case . in which case the fet@@ al of the Shift @-@ key will be helpful . therefore the end @-@ end files will be inserted at the end of the list , and not on the mouse position .
the play@@ list contains all the pieces of you to play and drop the order by selecting the entries into the desired place . once you enter letters , only the pieces are displayed . to reset the letters , you press so long the return button until the text@@ box is empty again .
if you enter with spaces separate search terms , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after entries are searching for , all search terms contain . if you enter for example one two three , the search will find all entries , one , two and three included .
if you choose between the search terms , will contain for entries , either one or the other search term . for example : one OR two OR three . in this example all pieces found , one or two or three ( or a combination of it ) .
if you want to search for entries , the spaces include , then include the search term with ge@@ ese : Mike Old@@ field . therefore , by entries , Mike Old@@ field will contain , not but by entries such as Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a certain search engines , you can also search for larger or smaller . for example : &gt; 50@@ . This is looking for mos@@ quit@@ oes that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece , which does not include a particular search term , set a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something is looking for mos@@ quit@@ oes that do not contain something .
you can combine this syn@@ tax variations in accordance with one another . for example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bad . this is looking for all the mos@@ quit@@ oes , which contain either Mike Old@@ field , or have a higher rating than 50 , and not contain the comment .
you can set the entries of entries by pressing the C@@ trl key , and then click with the right mouse button on the entries . the entries then receive a label with a number . the number corresponds to the sequence in which the pieces will be repeated .
the toolbar of the play@@ list is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some functionality of play@@ list . on the left you can add the button Add , to save play@@ list , play@@ list empty and random mix@@ ers .
next follow the buttons back @-@ backs and re@@ produce . this allows you to make changes in the play@@ list or restore it .
in the middle of the toolbar is a unique , wi@@ er@@ able analy@@ zer . the re@@ fres@@ her can be set with one click of the right mouse button on the Analy@@ zer .
the last button in the toolbar menu is menu . it opens the same menu as that you can get in the Player window via the right mouse button . over this menu you can set &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos; s configuration setup .
there are many other available buttons for the toolbar , for example playback and volume control . you can set the buttons displayed by clicking on menu and select toolbar .
the status bar gives you a quick overview of useful information on play@@ list . it shows the title of the current piece of pieces , the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces . in addition , the status for random and re@@ produce is easy to change by clicking the mouse twice in the corresponding display area .
you can also hide the status bar also . do not de@@ activate the status bar to display in general settings .
the context menu is accessible through a click with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking on the play@@ list menu . over this menu you can reach the settings of &amp; Amar@@ ok .
a click on this entry opens the window of visu@@ alizing plugins . there you can select the visu@@ al@@ isations of &amp; Amar@@ ok .
behind this entry , a sub @-@ menu with link@@ ups to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ ok ;
the Cover management is a useful accessory for managing your cover @-@ images . you can launch them by selecting actions cover management in your collection browsers .
the Cover management includes a list of all albums in your collection . you can view all albums of a interpre@@ ter in your collection by selecting the interpre@@ t on the left .
with the View menu you can choose what type of cover is to be displayed . select from :
the qu@@ eue administration received your big move in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this feature you have even more control over the play@@ list . after you set a piece into qu@@ eue , appears in the play@@ list one number next to the title . this number represents the sequence in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the pieces will play : 1 will first be played , 2 as second , and so on .
the administration of qu@@ eue will open you via extras qu@@ eue administration . if you want to add a piece in the play@@ list and then click + . you can also use the pieces in the play@@ list or using the context menu in the play@@ list . the order of the pieces can then change in qu@@ eue administration .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists from which two are already assigned ( the details for setting up this follow later ) .
fills your play@@ list with random pieces from your whole collection and adds further random pieces throughout the reproduction .
adds pieces based on last@@ .@@ f@@ m -@@ Recommen@@ d@@ ations ( formerly : Audi@@ os@@ cro@@ b@@ bler ) added . this mode requires that some pieces are in your play@@ list . you do not need last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to make this dynamic play@@ list .
just click on the desired play@@ list , drag them to the play@@ list window or click with the right mouse button on you and then select it . in this way , your current play@@ list will be replaced by the new one . you should save the old play@@ list below : with the
the two pres@@ et Mo@@ di zu@@ fold mix and play@@ list mix complete your play@@ list and you can add playback directly from your collection . the recommended pieces will be added each with an empty play@@ list and you &apos;ll have to add at least one piece of yourself from your collection . hence , your play@@ list will be filled with at the end of the first piece .
if you want to keep the current play@@ list , then activate the last possible dynamic mode : settings Dynamic Mode . this will use your existing play@@ list as starting point . over the same menu entry , the dynamic mode can also be disabled again .
the button Neu fill out the current play@@ list and adds new pieces according to dynamic mode new pieces . play@@ list opens the dialog to editing the play@@ list and you can change the appropriate settings .
with a right @-@ click on a dynamic play@@ list you have the opportunity to click Edit . then , the dialog to Edit the settings of the play@@ list will open .
enter any name for the play@@ list . however , the name should be unique to avoid confusion .
if this setting is not active , your play@@ list will be over continuously , the setting for coming pieces will be passed over and they will be re@@ played in this play@@ list , however , the setting will be active , the pieces are already played with attention to the h@@ ook@@ ed pieces .
mir@@ ro@@ red pieces - this is the number of mir@@ ro@@ cked pieces that are to be kept at the start of the play@@ list . thus , you can easily see which pieces have been recently played .
this is the number of pieces that are to be added after each played piece of play@@ list . if you set here more than 1 , the play@@ list will grow continuously , because only one piece is played and removed .
the settings on the right hand side were already described in the previous section . on the left side of dialog you can choose existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you cross multiple play@@ lists , &amp; Amar@@ ok , will add pieces from each of the play@@ lists play@@ lists .
some scripts enable its own settings . you can adjust the settings by launch the script and then click on .
you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok ; scripts installed by selecting the script in which a script for installation can be installed . after you install the script , a new entry in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet . you can also use the button more scripts .
if you do not want to use a script for longer , you can delete it . simply select the script from then click on un@@ install .
if you are looking for information about writing your own script , please look in the Write section of scripts .
the dialog window Visu@@ alisation plugins becomes available for activ@@ ating the available visu@@ al@@ isations in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the window contains a list of all available plugins . to use a plugin , simply tick the clip adjacent to the name .
this Quick Start should show you how to create an audio CD with &amp; K@@ 3@@ b . in order to detect the steps , you must have a loud installation of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and have a folder with audio files .
this is a dialog box where you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
if you want to burn an audio CD from MP3 s or other des@@ crip@@ ed formats , then remember that you are trying to get a bad quality , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check if an audio CD was created by a resistant format . use the project au@@ c@@ tual ect .
in this dialog box you can do nothing . wait , until the machine has completed the burning process .
this Quick Start should show you how to copy with &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; to copy a CD @-@ CD in just four steps . to take the steps below , you have to have a loud installation of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and the Qu@@ ell CD included in the CD @-@ ROM drive .
to copying a data CD , please select extras , CD copy ... from the menu . you now see a dialog with the possible settings to burning .
after you &apos;ve made all &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; please click the button Start . you now look at the button that looks like something or something like :
in this dialog box you can follow the progress of copy . once the inser@@ tion of the original is finished into the query file , you will be asked for an empty CD@@ ROM medium to which the data should be burned .

c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) . on the internet , such programs are commonly referred to as ri@@ pper .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis Library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , pat@@ ent@@ less and professional technology for audio coding and for the handling of audio data streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis benefits from open source and stands in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by the O@@ GG Vor@@ bis Dek@@ o@@ der@@ - and Enc@@ oder modules .
mad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG @-@ audio decoder . he currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Lay@@ er I , Lay@@ er II , and Lay@@ er III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder module .
l@@ ame : a widely developed MP3 Decoder , which can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial en@@ coding . l@@ ame is used by MP3 Enc@@ oder module .
FLA@@ C : an free open source code for los@@ s@@ free audio com@@ pression and de@@ com@@ pression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio enco@@ ders module , so that you can read and write FLA@@ C files .

norm@@ alize : this tool is used to suit the volume of music files on a standard level . this can be used e.g. for creating gem@@ i@@ x@@ ing CD &apos;s and MP3 collections ; without norm@@ alize , the various recording level of the various albums lead to the un@@ beautiful effect that the tun@@ es can be restored differently .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it includes the necessary software to boot from CD and automatically re@@ produce all videos in the basic folder of the CD .
this is a convenient method , recently opened projects again . the related sub @-@ menu contains a list of these projects . a click on an entry opens the project .
saves the current project . if the project was already stored once , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it is asked for a new fil@@ ename .
saves the current project under a new fil@@ ename . KDE &apos;s dialog Save as is displayed by which you can choose folders and fil@@ ename for the project .
saves all the opened projects . this is the same as if you would call for each individual project Save File .
includes the current project . if a project has changed and not saved , asks &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after what has to happen . you can then choose between save and change . besides , you can also break down and keep the project so open .
closes all opened projects . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; for each non @-@ stored project will ask what to happen , just as if you have called for each project .
closes all the opened projects and termin@@ ated &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; for each non @-@ stored project will be ques@@ tioned , what should be done so as if you had called the file .
if you access this entry , you can select the same effect as when you move the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the files appear in the basic folder of the CD .
opens the dialog &quot; Burn &quot; for the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the properties dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional button Burn , that promp@@ ted the medium . the burning dialog can only be opened when the project already contains data .
opens the properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described on what is it ? -@@ help ( reachable via the right mouse button ) .
this entry will only appear with an active data @-@ CD / DVD or video DVD project . it is useful when you use files for a multi@@ dimensional CD . the data of the previous session are always included . it is meant for you to be used rather than help so that you can already see existing files and folders using existing files .
this entry only appears at an active data @-@ CD / DVD or video @-@ DVD project . this function promp@@ ts &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; to remove files from the current project . this function removed no files from the medium , they bl@@ ends only the previously imported files back .
opens the CD Copy dialog . this also allows you to create a CD on a different medium . alternatively , you can also only burn an image from a CD which you can then eventually burn later . besides , there is also the possibility of climbing instead of normal copying . you should also copy CDs with broken sectors or video CDs .
opens the DVD Copy dialog . this also allows you to create a DVD to another medium . alternatively , you can also only burn an image from a DVD that you can then eventually burn later , so the target media must be big enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source media in the original form .
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW . so you can clear the whole content or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
opens the dialog to form@@ atting a DVD . with this dialog you can form@@ atted a DVD ± R ( W ) , thus reducing the content completely deleted . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the writing models and incre@@ mentally .
bur@@ ns a previously un@@ employed CD @-@ image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso , * .c@@ ue or * .@@ to@@ c file as data source that can be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . ( N@@ eron * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , for that you have to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
bur@@ ns a previously used DVD @-@ picture . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso file as a source of data , which can then be burned down by pressing the burning button .
a previously used DVD @-@ Video can be converted . this dialog box appears usually after reading a DVD in the content screen , but can also be used all @-@ mounted video , coding settings and even options for modi@@ fying the size and cut a black ri@@ bb@@ ons .
shows information about the covered medium . this information is presented in the content view and contain properties of the medium , such as size and title @-@ length of the CD or DVD .
shows a list of the toolbar of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; . if an entry is crossed , the toolbar is currently visible in the main window .
if this is crossed , a small gro@@ wers at the bottom of the window appears . it contains information about the status of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not ti@@ cked , the status bar is hidden .
folded the folder view one or out . the folder view includes an overview of your folder and the CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , its content is displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media information , locks and un@@ lock of running or throw the medium .
folded the content view one or out . the content view allows inser@@ ting and c@@ ess@@ ation of files into the project view . the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , provided that a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD was selected in the folder view .
switched the Kop@@ fl@@ ames in the project view one or out . the Kop@@ fl@@ ei@@ ste is a narrow area , which is only visible when the project view has open projects . the Kop@@ fl@@ ei@@ ste has no real function , it looks only hand@@ some and separates the project view clear from the rest of views .
this will open a dialog window to modify the key@@ boards for &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after having selected one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the button assignment to it .
this starts the K@@ 3@@ b ; temporary assist@@ ants . with this , the correct permission to configure CDs and DVDs are required . therefore , system @-@ car@@ et@@ aker requires , therefore , you have to enter the password for the system fix@@ tures ( root ) for the start of the wiz@@ ard ( root ) .
opens the settings of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; here you can make general programming @-@ settings . almost all the functions of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; should work on th@@ hi@@ eb . this dialog is intended for person@@ alizing and imag@@ ining of the program .
&amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; is how many other &amp; c@@ de ; applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script .
to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions to use , you can either use the command line utility m@@ co@@ p , or which are the somewhat more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the functional start , so that &apos;s more your taste and the type of your task is critical by giving the den@@ omin@@ ator you den@@ omin@@ ator .
in this chapter we take note that you can use the Command program d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; to make sure you have previously made that &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; then enter something like the following on the console :
in addition to the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions , all &amp; k@@ de ; program marked , supports &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts described below .
the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; features functions such as copy@@ CD , form@@ at@@ DVD and other features for creating new projects .

as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , you will receive a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : # K@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then generate a reference to the project using # d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b Proj@@ ect@@ d project .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface which can only be applied to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :

in this way , it is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then insert files into the new folder :

&amp; k@@ audi@@ sim@@ ulator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ excer@@ pts for &amp; k@@ de ; . with him can be easily stored audio CD ; s can be read and stored in MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG files . also other formats are possible , depending on the enc@@ oder which is installed on the machine .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ olog@@ ator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading from &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on the hard disk ) and by many co@@ ders who are currently supported ( This enco@@ ders ) are still supported from Linux distribution ) . further co@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first , the titles of the &amp; CD ; read and saved in WAV files on the computer ( ver@@ lu@@ st@@ freely and com@@ pressed ) ; and then
in a second step these WAV files ( usually one per cap@@ tions ) com@@ pressed into the MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG format , or in other formats such as the air @-@ free FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; c@@ audi@@ ov@@ as ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this has not yet been installed , this has to be done now .
for the second step l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other co@@ ders are already available , it is therefore very likely not necessary to compile something itself . however , only the co @-@ erer is not necessary to compile it . if for example , FLA@@ C is not used , its installation is not necessary .
which Ko@@ di@@ er@@ - / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction on co@@ ders , audio quality and com@@ pressing factors .
a word about copying audio CD ; s : as already said , &amp; k@@ audi@@ ov@@ ia to read off the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not provided for any copying audio CD ; however , it is not possible to avoid any protected audio CD ; even avoid the mechanisms of copying audio . simply avoid the purchase of copy @-@ protected audio CD ; s !
while exercising only once must be carried out ( the Quick dialog can be viewed as often as a suitable configuration ( hopefully ) , the daily use for reading a &amp; CD ; on the hard disk is explained ( hopefully ) for an understanding of the slim approach of the user interface , which you will frequently st@@ um@@ ble at the beginning .
can convert into many formats - depending on which coding programs installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; inform@@ s from the free@@ DB from the Internet or can work completely without a network , whereby everything is captured manually .
this is just a brief list of the commands of the main filter . on the page step by step example there are more information on how this program is used as well as screen@@ shots and descriptions of the tab for the configuration of the program .
starts the CD@@ DB request of CD @-@ data according to the establishment of request at the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be locally or online , in the latter case the connection must first be established . )
start reading and - if a enc@@ oder in the tab is configured in the default catalog - the coding .
opens a sub@@ menu with a list of available enc@@ oder , so that the selection with another enc@@ oder can be read out as the default . it is advisable to note that previously the enc@@ oder in the tab hall settings can be configured in the field dialog dialog .
opens the file manager , so an already selected file is selected instead of a complete &amp; CD ; out@@ line and en@@ coding .
opens the dialog dialog around the type of noti@@ fications ( like prot@@ ocols , pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for programs ( like reading the &amp; CD ; finished ) .
opens the main set @-@ up dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ sim@@ ator ; with different cart@@ els ( such as enc@@ oder , for alignment of the En@@ co@@ ders ) . hi@@ ther you have to go before the program can be successfully used !
this chapter describes audio quality , coding and com@@ pression rates and helps you in choosing the right code .
if no audio information is to be lost , a los@@ s@@ free audio format is required . beside FLA@@ C there are also other like &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; Mon@@ keys &apos; that may possibly be available for this distribution . the down@@ sides are the low com@@ pression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can re@@ produce those files .
among the audio formats , the information through data com@@ pression lose according to their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG can have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower Bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but on this bit@@ rate the differences are less important as both co@@ ders produce very good audio quality .
o &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is still free with most distribu@@ tions for free , but there are always open license questions
+ high up to very high sound quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to O@@ GG slightly deeper quality at deeper bit@@ rate .
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or machine based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG files are present .
MP3 - if music can also be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , disk ) or special car stereo systems . today - initially 2009 - support these devices mostly only the MP3 format .
a brief list of parameters to the audio quality and the resulting com@@ pression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for other parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting results in good transparency for most persons and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer for most persons and most of the music pieces accepted to provide transparency and has quite high quality . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , com@@ pression rate up to 6.3 . takes up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , com@@ pression rate approximately 5.5 . needs always 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a titles . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ H &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR common stereo , com@@ pression rate ca . 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a titles . well @-@ enough for music of you@@ ths , portable devices and car systems . but not good enough for better Hi@@ Fi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et Ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most individuals and most environments but if you absolutely want to have the absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size , then select this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information that will be done manually or retri@@ eved by the program automatically from the free@@ DB via the Internet , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can be delivered with &amp; k@@ audi@@ ov@@ ator ; and the code file to generate the folder and file name as well as the characteristics of music files .
in connection with co @-@ programs , there is often a combination of programs for the co@@ ders and those parameters here . the manual or the help to the co@@ ders declare the switches for these programs .
e.g. around the &amp; CD ; title to the keywords ( English : day ) add when MP@@ 3@@ s are co@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switch must be added by l@@ ame and the title parameter of &amp; c@@ audi@@ ov@@ ator ; the result looks like this : &apos; ... w@@ tt { gender } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; audio aud@@ iting ; parameters that can be used ( = button @-@ design@@ ation in assist@@ ants ) :
this is what the free@@ DB is : a free database , where the people can download and enter the information , so that all the other information can be downloaded instead of yourself : &amp; CD ; title , artist , names of the pieces &amp; etc . , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( An@@ nam@@ ing of the U@@ eb@@ ers@@ ee ) am not attorney . however , no one can prevent from the &amp; CD ; learn more or less worth@@ less , so can neither the artist nor the music @-@ enterprise damage . all information can be added in a b@@ um@@ mel through a &amp; CD ; shop , physical or virtu@@ alized .
in &amp; k@@ audi@@ ov@@ ator ; is actively called a cross @-@ lane ( sending an address ) . for the use of free@@ DB may not be used with another ( counter@@ f@@ eit ) address than those in the system , the e @-@ mail address is not used when retri@@ ev@@ ing the data from the server ( This can only be the programmer who has checked the code ) .
there are many countries copies of the main database . if &amp; c@@ audi@@ ov@@ ator is set up ; for the use of free@@ DB , the geograph@@ ically located at the next mirror server is to be used . this saves band@@ width within the network and compar@@ es the burden between the b@@ ills .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a list of refl@@ ections for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during the reading of a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) just the updates of the database .
which reading program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to know more exactly the source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; see to note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package has to be installed first if this has not yet been done .
for stor@@ ing the WAV files can be chosen the Ko@@ di@@ erer and thus the desired file format . at first opening there are pre @-@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a twi@@ sting free com@@ pression for audio data ) on the tab . other co@@ ders can be added on this tab .
the coo@@ ker package must be installed from the corresponding Linux distribution before the code can be used . this is also necessary for pre@@ defined co@@ ders . more information about Ko@@ di@@ erer are located in the chapter Wh@@ ich co@@ ders .
after installing a code , further information about his switch can be obtained through the input of a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a con@@ sol@@ ete window ( eg ; con@@ sole ) . it must be replaced by the name of the installed Ko@@ di@@ ers .
this can have many causes . check the device of device recording of &amp; CD ; / DVD drives , the writing and readers of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) are installed . try both programs with a command line in a terminal . that could give an indication of what is wrong .
check if you do not want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the sleeve of &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with one step by step example . even if you use other settings , these tips can give you how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , everything understood , but somehow is still uns@@ ure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information about doing those areas that you want to do exactly what you want .
in this example , we will launch the program for the first time , all set up and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 keywords ( tags ) .
it must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found for example with a search engine , as it is not necessary to compile source files , which you can of course always do .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you own scre@@ aming it ( eg ; by trying to do something in the context of the quer@@ or ) .
the first section covers the basic set of &amp; audio aud@@ iting ; something which is likely to be done once and
the second section describes how to read the procedure for reading a &amp; CD , what needs to be repeated and to be repeated .
here we determine the coo@@ ker for the com@@ pression of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the resulting audio quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) . as we are la@@ zy , we divide the program to use the free@@ DB to download the &amp; CD ; data from the internet .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will be very likely not to change with each output of a &amp; CD . change once the appropriate settings are found .
the device @-@ drawing is transferred to the reader program so that it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces read .
often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device @-@ drawing of your drive . if this is not working or when more than a &amp; CD ; / DVD Drive can also be accessed , allowing a view to the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt using the available entries for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the cart@@ on card General settings . here there is not much to do . here , an additional conversion is defined . in our example everything will be displayed as soon as shown in the screen@@ shot .
only in case of complete information please select so you will be informed when information on the testi@@ fy of keywords ( tags ) are missing .
the map card CD ; -@@ Settings . just select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD . data automatically download via the Internet from an free@@ DB machine .
note : the computer must be connected during reading the &amp; CD ; connected to the Internet so that he can access the free@@ DB server .
the second selection field is sim@@ pler , a &amp; CD ; entry found immediately starts the reading of &amp; CD ; which is later un@@ happy with the database entry and the file name / fil@@ ename or file name , they can easily change . the directory or fil@@ ename will be changed with Kon@@ quer@@ or@@ - &gt; ren@@ ame and the ID@@ 3 @-@ tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , if you want to manually enter all the selection areas and free@@ DB is not used . however , this about 620 MB large , consider this twice if this is worth it . to be selected to free@@ DB in the offset emo@@ dus , the two choices must be selected at least the first . the mode is set up on the following map @-@ card .
CD@@ DB is for us free@@ DB . these are settings for the data @-@ request , for retri@@ eval the &amp; CD ; information from free@@ DB @-@ server on the Internet . how does the system know which data is to get the CD ? read the section about free@@ DB . put everything as shown in the screen@@ shot .
mode : we have not downloaded the database , we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB @-@ server : please go to the site fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server near you . on this way the burden will be distributed among the b@@ ills . however , this setting will work as a first attempt .
both function similarly to the server , but many fire@@ walls can bo@@ ast the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , perhaps more luck with the protocol 80 , since the &amp; HTTP ; protocol is usually open to surf the Internet .
in this example we do not want to submit a &amp; CD to the free@@ DB server . the first authentic@@ ation should be dis@@ solved .
just take over the settings of the screen@@ shot . ( make sure the folder / tmp is existed on your computer )
at the same time in@@ coming pieces , sorry , there is a reason why more than one at the same time in just an existing drive ? parall@@ els reading and co@@ ding ? the author does not know it , therefore just try .
CD ; after reading the last piece of pieces , you cross this to release the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process .
user @-@ defined folder for temporary files : when you cross this file , then / must be specified the path / folder where the WAV files are stored , the files in the private folder will not be created . forget this folder if you want to make something with the WAV files .
all the same as it is shown on the screen@@ shot . the command is somewhat long , under circumstances something must be turned on to the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good Hi@@ Fi stereo systems . the resulting plate factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and storage .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the restriction of tags to version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1.@@ &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tag can also be deleted if required . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; Tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
continue the rest as shown in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside this example :
the number of WAV files : with dual Core or Quad@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine can be tried to en@@ code more than one WAV file at the same time .
this is it , we have just finished the basic setup of &amp; audio aud@@ iting ; this configuration is used as standard for each output of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organisational structure of your music , you never need to change them again .
in this section , described how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; on the hard disk the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard disk , as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from the free@@ DB shall be described . the process of which is described in this section , must be repeated for any out@@ going &amp; CD .
since we use a &amp; CD , which is not yet available in free@@ DB , the screen@@ shots are a little different from the data for a &amp; CD ; with successfully from free@@ DB dis@@ crete data . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually to collect , instead of retri@@ eve them from the Internet . comments will be shown to the differences .
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example here is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this Hand@@ book .
if this has not yet been done so now the &amp; CD ; in the drive that was defined in the main window .
after a short moment the pieces and their length in the window should be listed just as shown in the screen@@ shot . this only when the &amp; CD ; as an audio CD , could be identified and can be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this does not happen then you are looking for questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings .
caution : if the &amp; CD was successfully completed by the free@@ DB , all the titles of the pieces are filled out and in addition , the name of the artist and album are shown .
in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; key for your &amp; CD ; gives a window appears , and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best for your &amp; CD .
if you do not have the rout@@ ing for the automatic query of free@@ DB ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in dialog for the settings ) , you can also manually re @-@ use it by choosing the first button in the toolbar . if you have no local database , you need the connection to the Internet .
E 1.2 Session 02 : the CD @-@ Editor - input of CD @-@ data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the sample in the next screen@@ shot you will see the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Ac@@ tual title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; album &apos; .
the artist does not need to enter into the input field &apos; Ac@@ tual title &apos; unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece .
the lower comment field can be used for the individual comments s@@ ally each piece , the commentary box of the album is used for comments which apply together for all of the pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of data from the free@@ DB the CD editor will not be empty , but it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editorial , so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album names ( e.g. if all words with upper@@ case letters start or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments .
note : this example we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ tags . this limit the length of the fields on 30 characters for the artist , album and title of one piece and on only 28 characters for the comment . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v2 tag ; this option will be set up on the tab lab@@ yrinth . this option will be set up on the tab lab@@ yrinth code .
you can change the day @-@ information of the generated files at any time using the Tag Editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
tags will not be supported by all co@@ ders or file formats . see in the help of the co @-@ erer to obtain more information .
just choose an entry that obviously agre@@ es with the style of the out@@ read CD ; in this example , this is not important , since we do not submit the &amp; CD ; data so why not go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or rap for example are to be found at rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD editors will be back and you will see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data we have recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the current piece . the title of the piece is definitely and other information you wish .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the titles of &amp; CD .
attention : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the free@@ DB . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the toolbar . note that the artist and the album will be shown on the item list .
notice that it has been a check @-@ sign in front of each line of a piece . only the titles which are marked so are read . simply select that all pieces are selected , or st@@ ressing the button All pieces select on the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at one time .
was started by clicking on the kno@@ b selection process , then this window appears to confirm . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what happens .
click on the rider orders for switching on the order pane . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the toolbar .
this is the window for control of orders . the first piece is currently read on the hard disk . the status of the program is shown in the lower part of the window in the status line .
this error message you can see if you &apos;re trying to work with a co @-@ erer , which you have not yet installed . pieces that have not been successfully co@@ ded with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the target folder are not what we have entered here in the example . did you check if you have writing to the folder for the temporary files and the target folder ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the reading of the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the coding of pieces 1 in the format MP3 . thus , read and code in parallel . note the status of the status in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has found no configuration settings to push this behavior . the only thing that can be configur@@ able is the number of parall@@ els processes for reading and coding . in high @-@ performance machines the result is un@@ clear . the machines used with a AM@@ D@@ 64 does not seem to have a problem in simultaneous evaluation and en@@ coding ( from however two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read out , while another piece is co@@ ded and a third order is co@@ ded in the qu@@ eue of the Ko@@ di@@ ers . after the last piece is co@@ ded , a small window will appear with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ sim@@ ulator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create com@@ pressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the co @-@ erer of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ sim@@ ulator ; used today within the &amp; k@@ de ; CV@@ S can be used as part of the dem@@ ec@@ tical package . however , if you have already included a anonymous copy here , as &amp; k@@ audi@@ olog@@ ator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package is included . install the package of engine@@ ered media from your distribution . if you read this , you have probably already done it ...
this section is directed to persons who compile data files , and not intended for users to use a pre @-@ compiled package of your distribution .
if you are looking for help how the program can be adapted to your needs when it is running time , then the following is correct for you :
a program that calls many different programs , has many variations of settings . best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen@@ shots of different cart@@ ons of settings and also includes comments for options that are not used for example .
Hi , still am read on ? even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked according to the first @-@ time Star@@ ts of the program , without any cl@@ ue as it should go on of this somehow empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD in the drive ) , or by un@@ usually short menu ?
what &apos;s about ? who reads this , probably has already started the program . it should somehow look like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author cannot maintain this hand@@ book . it is intended as the first version for a manual to be audi@@ audi@@ ble ; may it do . at least only after contact with the author . and if you read this , he will leave this section and therefore agree with this suggestion .
strange , if you have succeeded is to pick the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N then you don &apos;t need this information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kar@@ a@@ ok@@ es@@ pi@@ eler by &amp; k@@ de ; . in addition to others he did not have some properties , the other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it is based on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS - and &amp; k@@ de ; support too . &amp; k@@ mid ; also supports the &amp; Linux ; ul@@ as@@ ound project driver , which is required for the GUS cards . AL@@ SA is involved as soon as it supports a sequence .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color so it is easy to follow the piece .
graphic representation of the activity of each MIDI @-@ channel through high@@ lighting of the oppressed buttons on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop that you can drag in &amp; k@@ de ; each MIDI file from a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; window can drag on K@@ Mid set .
supports the two existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( lyrics or text valves ) . K@@ Mid set automatically the respective procedure .
seat support . if you end &amp; k@@ de ; end during the play@@ time of a song , K@@ Mid starts again next time with the same song .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , AW@@ E , FM and GUS cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can Open Open ... from the menu file . it appears the usual file dialog with which help you can choose the desired song .
you can also send a file from a &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; window drop . this also works with multiple songs at the same time .
to play a music piece , open it and commit the button playing in the toolbar , select the entry play out of the menu pieces from or pressing the spac@@ eb@@ ar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts as soon as you start it on the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window pull . ( with several gaps , they will be added to a collection and then played down@@ side . )
once &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece plays , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive with the controller .
if you find that a song is too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows left and right of the template and thus change the play@@ speed . to recover the original speed , double click the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the spac@@ eb@@ ar has two tasks : if a piece is played , a pressure on the kno@@ ck@@ hand such as a pressure on the button &apos; break or selecting the menu entry in the menu piece , then breaks the playback . pressing the spac@@ eb@@ ar while no piece is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
lyrics can be stored on two types in a music piece . some pieces use tex@@ tili@@ an , others use lyrics and again others both . some pieces do not have any text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can adjust which events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically chosen to activate a song , so that you have nothing to manually adjust the entry automatic text text , but you still have the possibility to change this when you want to see the other way .
if you want to set out an event type , select from the menu Settings the entries of Tex@@ ts or Li@@ eder@@ eig@@ sions . the same function also have keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files , which you summar@@ ize . these will be played in the series . in this section , how you can use collections effectively .
to create a collection , you first open the collection manager . these can be found in the menu collection under the point Organ@@ ize .... Click here to New and give the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then select the name for the new collection . this collection will contain at the beginning the same songs as the original .
if you have more than one collection , you can set the wr@@ apped in the collection manager .
in the temporary collection there are all songs that you want to add to no other collection .
while leaving the application this collection will not be stored . find concerns when you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , they have to be selected in the collection manager . there , you can add a song with the button Add . it appears in turn the file dialog with which help you can choose the desired song .
a second method to add a song depends on the setting of automatic add to the collection .
if automatic add to the collection is activated , a piece while opening ( using File Open or Dra@@ g &amp; Drop ) automatically added to the active collection .
when automatic add to the collection is not activated , when opening an item the temporary collection is activated and pun@@ ished . this collection will then be added to the opened pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , the collection and the desired song and then click on Del@@ ete .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the sequence from the menu check@@ up menu , the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection .
when you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be fixed .
to send a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the selection list above the kar@@ ao@@ ke text .
to move a song , select the button next song , the entry next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right .
to jump back a song , select the button prec@@ eding piece , the entry previous piece from the menu item or press the arrow to the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection and click the button del@@ eting .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter what it is not saved when leaving &amp; k@@ mid ; not saved .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thesizer that are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ map General @-@ MIDI events will be translated into events that understands the syn@@ thesizer .
for example , you can create a MIDI map , all the events of the typ@@ s Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the typ@@ s Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et conver@@ ts and thus getting a trumpet again , if originally a piano should play .
if you have only one sound card , you do not need MIDI @-@ map , because all sound@@ cards are GM -@@ compatible ( incl . AW@@ E - and GUS cards , FM @-@ devices and so on ) .
sorry , there are no programs to create MIDI @-@ Maps . so you need to edit the appropriate file from hand ( using your favourite editor ) .
a MIDI @-@ map is a text @-@ file that saves all necessary conver@@ sions for the playback of a piece .
each section may only appear once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MAP -@@ section which may appear so often as desired . the prerequisite for it is that each animal has a different text ID ( see below ) .
defects PAT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine KE@@ Y@@ MAP &quot; name of Key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine KE@@ Y@@ MAP &quot; A further Key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D db ... EN@@ D
you see that Def@@ ine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for options ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as an e @-@ mail , so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can be used for devices that are not general MIDI @-@ compatible .
in this section , as the pat@@ ches of General MIDI to your specific keyboard is illustrated . the general use looks as follows :
please note that the left side of the equ@@ ation is ignored . it is assumed that the GM Pat@@ ches are in the right sequence ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order and leave no line for any of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ key@@ s@@ To M is needed to put all notes that need this instrument to put on the sound with the number M . if your keyboard ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which includes the following in the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP range section :
if now a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with Patch 127 ( Win ) , it takes patch 100 ( the Drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , ir@@ respective of which sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that here with the term drum patch of the Patch is meant to be a different perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ist ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ als , Mar@@ acas &amp; etc ; ) and not the one where the sound means the clay height of the always same drum ( how many key@@ boards possess ) .
the KE@@ Y@@ MAP Section is needed to specify as tones on a certain channel or instrument .
as with PAT@@ CH@@ MAP -@@ section the order of lines is very important , as well as their existence . you need to create 128 entries .
you can use multiple key@@ boards for each channel and each instrument . you only have to use different names in the first row .
Key@@ maps are used mainly to make sound @-@ t@@ ints on the be@@ acon channel . check out for example the supplied key@@ boards .
this section can be used to form some channels to others . if you want to exp@@ ose some channels from the first and second channel , make this quite simply in CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP .
however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards , which have percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI to Channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) .
Midi @-@ Geräte you need 16 channels , the CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP Section therefore has 16 lines , numbered between 0 to 15 , rebuilt following the following pattern :
N is part of the canal which is formed on the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the Key@@ map will need to be defined in the file name for this channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored , which will change the patch on this canal . in this case , patch is then used patch x .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful for example to use the Per@@ sp@@ inal Patch on the be@@ acon channel .
the value of pit@@ ch@@ ben@@ ds gives rise to which ratio Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der @-@ events are multiplied . so if a MIDI file is sent a pitch @-@ edge event with the value n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then only passed . the value 40@@ 96 is used so that in the Map File ( no dec@@ imal number ) .
this setting is needed because GM proposes that a pitch is supposed to play a pitch 40 , a tone higher . unfortunately , however , some key@@ boards get higher to play by two tones down to an oc@@ tave higher . to try to try the right value on your keyboard , you must try a bit of &amp; k@@ mid ; try to try .
to use a MIDI @-@ map , just open the dialog MIDI settings . this can be found in the menu under Settings , point MIDI settings
the can@@ al@@ view is a window with a whole host of pi@@ anos ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these pi@@ anos you see which sounds are currently being played .
you can use the can@@ al@@ view also to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel there is a selection list where you can choose a instrument , sh@@ ines the button no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view has ( until now ) two different views to display the played notes . view the view inside menu Settings under the point of the view : settings
the pace @-@ LCD shows the speed at which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the pace of a song . so if you find e.g. a song be too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the pace , use the arrows left and right off the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a music piece has to be played . it contains the notes , the rhythm , the speed , &amp; etc ; . that can result the same MIDI file on two different devices , just as two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way .
well , I can not force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 @-@ file you need a similar sound quality . with a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments , the speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything .
that may happen if you have a bin@@ ary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) from &amp; k@@ mid ; have happened , because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support was compiled . to remove the problem you must download a source distribution and install ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos; s )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection but I have no desire to add all the files individually .
do not agree to accept &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; Drop . just open the folder you want to add in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; select all the files and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window .
do not necessarily enable the setting of automatic add to the collection . otherwise , the files are added to the temporary collection .
you can click the arrow key left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD display to slow the reproduction . to restore the default pace you can double on the LCD .
I have been on a &amp; k@@ de ; desktop area a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this way I must play when the collection is to finish or I want to play a file , just into the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window changes and the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ;
if you just want to listen to a file without adding them immediately to a collection , turn off the setting automatic add to the collection , and the new ; file is added to the temporary collection added .
suppose that you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mi@@ d. will just want to play the first file . so set the setting automatic Add to Collection and Open A.@@ mi@@ d. your temporary collection then contains exactly this a MIDI file .
then join yourself , also B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection of all three files . how do you make it ?
these people sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . all thank you ! if I listen to these songs or see the postcard , animated me to write &amp; k@@ mid ; to program .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ ac@@ ute ; laga or for the moment I &apos;m not much free time for my hob@@ bies , but I &apos;m still trying to make myself a bit of time . as hob@@ bies I gather programming , MIDI files , music make and prove propositions .
if you want to know where to download MIDI / kar@@ ao@@ ke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you want to make me happy , write an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es
you really make me a great pleasure for me if you send me a postcard from your location or a MI@@ DI@@ - / kar@@ ao@@ ke file from a local group . all who send me a postcard from &amp; k@@ mid ; but if you send a MIDI file , you should contact me , as I may already have the file already .
I have been &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my free time and by anyone telling money for this money . I would like to empha@@ size that I will only be more programmed because / if I come back feedback from users ( post@@ cards or e @-@ mails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ w@@ ai and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - Rem@@ oting the bug that the pitch was too high at AW@@ E cards .

a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer , as the sound quality depends fundamentally on your sound@@ card . it is not the same if you use a FM radio device or a AW@@ E card .
if you have no sound card , you have to compile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it will run as if you had a sound card , except you cannot hear music .
if any problems occur , please contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists or send a message directly to me .
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , Ph@@ ono and FF@@ M@@ peg . the program used to play video files by M@@ Player or Ph@@ on@@ on supported formats , as well as playing DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera .

the use window is made from so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the key view . either , there is a window with the play@@ list . and finally there is a information window , which will only be displayed when information is re@@ mit .
it is possible to send the preferred connections among the menu book@@ marks , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries , which are to be played after each other , so you should use the category permanent play@@ list .
of course , you can add groups to groups to receive an additional Hier@@ archy . if you have an entry , his group and all his sub@@ groups will be copied to the current category and the reproduction begins with the cli@@ cked entry .
the categories &apos; Current play &apos; , television and permanent play@@ list may also be changed by direct editing of the XML configur@@ ing files . of course you can only do it if &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; not by using an editor , but also by application itself . simply click on a name of a category click on the menu view and the next Edit Mode . by the cli@@ cking of a sub@@ group , only the XML content of this part will be displayed .
after modi@@ fying XML files , must be selected from the menu on the same with play@@ list , and either select the Edit Mode , or select another category .
all changes are lost if the mach@@ ining mode are left or another group is selected without going to complete the play@@ list .
following the convenience of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; some features may be switched only by changing the XML configuration files ..
the animation during start@@ up and operator can be disabled by the editing of ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ w@@ c and Change by &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ iger option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be inserted easily .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; the files will be ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / box@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation during start@@ up does not need to be short , it is automatically finished by opening a different source . however , this would not end when end @-@ animation , however , the user can finish the application a second time .
a simple example of a start @-@ animation can be the ads of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; im@@ g ; &amp; lt ; im@@ g / k@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; meet ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; sm@@ il@@ gt ; In the source package of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; are in the directory tests / some examples of S@@ MIL that are supported by &amp; MIL that by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; are supported .
there is a tab for the configuration of M@@ Player in the configuration dialog from &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; here the path can be set by the M@@ Player and the intermediate memory size of the disk from the network and other things .
another tool for de@@ bug@@ ging is the button &apos; console &apos; in the toolbar . here is the output of M@@ Player visible .
there is no tab for this ren@@ ditions in the configuration dialog from &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; all must be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ er@@ c . here is an example of a &apos; flash &apos; with the module sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa .
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; it may even be played the special field for YouTube in the play@@ list XML .
so that the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages can re@@ produce , the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; Module as service provider for the MI@@ ME type application / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave flash can be specified in the typ@@ ing dialog on KDE .
the Cond@@ or or &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; found in a con@@ soles application and search for messages related to charging the browser module library . the harv@@ ested process is called kn@@ p@@ player . if no error occurred , the back@@ end issue is to be released within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console , or console out of the context menu ) .
as always a given back@@ end is taken for a certain MI@@ ME type ( of course only when this was determined on ) , this must be done by manually changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ er@@ c . for example , ph@@ on@@ on may re@@ produce all og@@ g files :
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can play TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this requires k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV may be sh@@ ew@@ ed , that can be used to be used device and the TV channels can be configured manually by the configuration file or the configuration file can be manually edited .
to configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( Video data record ) settings in the k@@ m@@ player , dialog in the settings below - &gt; Source &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video port . there should be identified by which one is selected . the proper coding must be found out ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a clock in it .
since the V@@ DR can benefit from k@@ m@@ player only X@@ Video , should X@@ Video also work ( pres@@ um@@ ably is this type of playing video equipment among Linux the only works ) . for this reason , the vide@@ o@@ for@@ lin@@ ux needs to be functional for the X Server must therefore contain the following in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / XF@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) for this reason .

are there cl@@ ues as to make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play from him ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is used as users root after receiving the device . it is absolutely secure to ensure that / dev / c@@ drom indicates the CD@@ ROM drive .
X@@ ine starts only slowly , why has its CPU to be tested on their performance every time ?
note : the answer is over@@ hol@@ t. k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the last saved value , only the first time will examine X@@ ine the CPU .

lat@@ ex ; : a professional un@@ veil@@ ing application . under Unix @-@ like systems will probably be back on the package &amp; tex@@ live ; respectively &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux ; distribution . for installation , documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be attracted .
the &amp; k@@ ile ; project contains some already compiled packages of &amp; k@@ ile ; for different distribution . these allow for easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the k@@ ile ; website .
this hand@@ book is for everyone - regardless of the experiences with &amp; Lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; k@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users must hardly read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation must be taken into account . however , the support to this project or its documentation is desired , should contact the k@@ ile ; web site should be established .
step up or when posting &amp; k@@ ile ; on or become extensions , this should be addressed on the mailing list k@@ ile @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ s@@ our@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; k@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; desktop environment . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers the possibility for using all &amp; Lat@@ ex ; programs in a graphical interface and within these a simple , immediate and tailor @-@ made access to all these . finally , the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; reference and the powerful project management .
to learn more about &amp; Kate ; and its ways to experience the manual should be attracted to Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can start directly with the reading of the chapter with the editor of Kate .

just like other recording languages includes &amp; Lat@@ ex ; an introduction with which the most common properties such as paper format , num@@ bering and texture , begins with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ end { document } again .
the quick @-@ entry @-@ assistant of &amp; k@@ ile ; is an anno@@ ying function for the fast creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; . the selection of the wiz@@ ard ( menu ) provides some possibilities for the creation of the document . it also allows some possibilities to be made related to the document .
document Cl@@ asses : this is the type of document selected : article ( article ) , book &#91; letter &#93; , report &#91; report &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ ot@@ re &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ ot@@ book &#93; , proj@@ ector &#91; Be@@ amer &#93; , Films &#91; prosp@@ er &#93; or Custom .
coding : hereby the string sets is set . modern systems are increasingly using the U@@ TF @-@ 8 -@@ coding as standard . best , U@@ TF @-@ 8x should be en@@ forced ( for correct processing of &amp; Lat@@ ex ; documents ) .
this list shows the usually used replacement available for &amp; Lat@@ ex ; for the integration they are ins@@ ulated only in the cli@@ p@@ field .
article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , Report ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) : the document ranges from Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) .
new users are now not worried anymore . it is merely a brief description of the functions and further information to this is given in the section .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers - just like other source editors - the high@@ lighting of the used commands , attitudes and elements ( as well as the in@@ appropriate ) . by &amp; k@@ ile ; it is worth men@@ tioning it by the mod@@ est appearance of output file nevertheless notices again . however , it will be saved by the high@@ lighting time and Ã ¶ r@@ ator .
with the automatic read@@ iness of the environments , when entering a new command ( e.g. \ The beginning { command } ) by &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically a spac@@ er ( for the input of the text ) and the associated line ( command } ) . this function can be disabled in the menu ; setup ... La@@ Te@@ X commands .
all documents are normally divided into some elements . &amp; Lat@@ ex ; refresh the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the quick@@ est and sub@@ cut@@ ted item ) :
in the view of the document in the structure , the individual elements can be switched on and viewed by one mouse @-@ click on the respective device .
when creating your own &amp; Lat@@ ex ; files can be very helpful ( engl . D e V ice I n@@ dependent File ) &#93; was created , jump &amp; k@@ ile ; by a click with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; viewer on the corresponding line in the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; source code .
a DVI ; -@@ file contains a description of the form@@ atted document and also other information like the font and is next to PDF the necessary output of &amp; tex ; or &amp; Lat@@ ex ; there are many tools for view , conversion and printing of DVI ; files for various systems and co@@ ats .
when using the resist@@ or search , the elements of DVI ; -@@ file has been cli@@ cked , is the exact opposite of it . once on a section in the DVI ; source code was cli@@ cked , the corresponding location in the DVI ; viewer are switched on in the appropriate place in the DVI ; viewer .
Master @-@ Document : this feature is used when working with multiple files . with a master document the work with other integrated .@@ tex files simpli@@ fies . when using a project , a project can be set up a project project project in project project .
quick @-@ construction : the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if there is no error in the source code ) .
file watch@@ word : in this mode the DVI ; -@@ file is available on local , and it does not take a call to &amp; oc@@ ular ; after fast construction .
in consideration of the work toolbar , the three co@@ aches of selection should be fo@@ rest@@ ores . the choices are designed for quick integration of the document into parts , chapter , sections , ... Die ver@@ fÃ ¼ g@@ able &amp; Lat@@ ex ; instructions for sub@@ division are :
the selection field Fur@@ ther is the introduction of articles such as keywords , joints , or reference . the possibilities are :
name : with this command a name for a section , one image or different element is created .
reference : is used for the reference to a fixed name ( selection of a choice ) .
when using quote will be shown a selection list with liter@@ ary entries . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; these files are appropriate Edit@@ ors . the author has good experience with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can also be written in &amp; k@@ ile ; by hand .
the last drop @-@ down with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ Ã ¶ e is used for the definition of fon@@ ts , for the main text , the joints , etc. are specified , etc. are the following characters :
by calling &amp; k@@ ile ; two choices for reference : 1 . the wiz@@ ard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and fir@@ st@@ aging the settings . 2 . the document can be written from scratch .
the brack@@ ets according to the command \ \ Docum@@ ent@@ class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; lays down the font . the fon@@ ts may not occur at the beginning , this can also be sp@@ Ã ¤ r@@ alled in the text .
once the above source code example has been compiled , the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; source code has to be compiled . the sim@@ pl@@ est way to this is to use the Men@@ Ã ¼ s or the button .
the source code must be saved in front of the comp@@ iling . &amp; k@@ ile ; perform the storage automatically .
stim@@ ulating the document missing , should be sought in log@@ ging after errors . when using quick @-@ structure should be started &amp; oc@@ ular ; this is not the case , it should also be observed as log@@ ging .
an environment ( engl@@ . environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the remaining document . for example a report with the fon@@ ts may have been created , \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ n { environment } .
the items are only accessible within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) ber@@ l . there is no compl@@ ac@@ ency in the area .
there are many possibilities to increase the read@@ ability and user @-@ friendliness of the document . it allows for example to add certain fon@@ ts , obesity , sub@@ str@@ aps , etc . these commands either by command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the course of course and is as long as possible , until it is closed by a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a sentence can be displayed with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ rate : creates a quote in the document . the quote begins with \ \ beginning { rate } and ends with \ \ end { rate } .
after the background for writing the source code with the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; indic@@ ative language , follows now a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; k@@ ile ;
once in the assist@@ ants a little text was given , a few adjustments for the better read@@ ability of the document should be completed . this should be a quote , a few places in obesity and cur@@ sive , and a poem to apply to see the differences of these commands .
once the document was viewed , can be del@@ ayed by Editor @-@ view or C@@ trl E back to the editor ( in the internal viewer ) . at an external viewer , its window must be closed .
once the DVI ; -@@ file has been created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; post@@ Script ; / PDF file . just try and checked .
DVI ; is an framed file format ( engl . D e V ice I n@@ dependent ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; Lat@@ ex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .d@@ vi edition such as printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF -@@ conver@@ ters or computer screen sa@@ ver .
for printing a &amp; DVI ; File be printed with the same steps as for the document generation ( see ) . in the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , then the document can be printed by a file ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is correct ) .
the toolbar panel allows the conversion of DVI ; -@@ file into other formats . once the DVI ; file from the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; source code was created , the conversion into won different formats using the buttons in the toolbar .
the fores@@ kin search gives the direct jump from the editor to the associated position within the DVI ; -@@ file .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers an appropriate setting for all &amp; Lat@@ ex ; bin@@ aries . this includes only Modern under settings K@@ ile set up ... Tools sti@@ cking .
to execute the pre @-@ search search , the mouse po@@ inter must be cli@@ cked in a line of the source code and click on the advance search . the jump to the appropriate place in the DVI ; viewer are then done .
with this function in &amp; oc@@ ular ; with one click of the middle mouse button in DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; document of &amp; k@@ ile ; read &amp; k@@ ile ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ( settings Ok@@ ular setup ... Editor )
should when using quick @-@ mounting of &amp; DVI ; viewer are not possible , there may be a mistake . should an error be pre@@ valent , this is displayed in the prot@@ ocols detail or in the message window .
the prot@@ ocols file speci@@ fies the error message in the source code . in the editor will always be the line where the error appears . to view the faul@@ ty line , you have to be cli@@ cked on the error in the log@@ ging and &amp; k@@ ile ; jump to faul@@ ty line .
once on the corresponding button in the toolbar appears , a window appears to choose from the template to be used for the document . the pres@@ et features are :
in the selection of empty document , a document can be used either from scratch or the wiz@@ ard for fast creation of a new document . further information is contained in the section .
FAQ of &amp; Lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction to virtually all documents . templates will be created , saved and loaded to make the preparation of a new document easier .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file starting up or create a new file . &amp; k@@ ile ; can create a new template using the document of an existing document and selection of a file template .
when creating a new document from a template by file New , some string will be replaced by other data ( e.g. name or string coding ) . this variable enables you to set up settings in settings of K@@ ile .
when creating your own template it is therefore necessary to know what character sets of which variables are replaced :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ M@@ ENT@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OPTI@@ ONS $ $ : this character type is replaced by input into document class . typically , it is the following form : \ \ Docum@@ ent@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ M@@ ENT@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OPTI@@ ONS $ $ &#93; { article } .
the sim@@ pl@@ est way to create a template is the use of the wiz@@ ard and the associated entry for the commands in the editor . once the document was created in this manner , the following steps were done :
when creating a new document then the own template instead of the selected list can be selected .
a template may be made from any &amp; Lat@@ ex ; files created , should be sear@@ ched for a simple way to create a template , should be looked after one in the internet and the steps described below .
&amp; k@@ ile ; used &amp; Kate ; as an internal editor . &amp; Kate ; is a text editor for reading the reading and high@@ lighting of many different types of text ( including also &amp; Lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for you can be made directly from &amp; k@@ ile ;

&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command reference , which can be accessed by men@@ Ã ¼ help La@@ Te@@ X reference . you will be able to find an exhaus@@ tive description nearly all commands , which can be found in &amp; Lat@@ ex ; use can be taken as well as their syntax .
a double @-@ click with printed Str@@ g button , in order to pick the &amp; tex ; -@@ word . this means that in this way clicking on \ \ par \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ par y@@ bri@@ ds .
when drag@@ ging the text with the right mouse button , the full text is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board .
when using the arrow keys with button @-@ old taste , you can taste parts of the source text in the editors .
&amp; k@@ ile ; has the possibilities to browse through multiple types of sources and to highlight these styles . for example , the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; commands from the normal text and also the mathemati@@ cal form@@ ulas are highlighted by another color .
many assist@@ ants can include the same type of book@@ marks . this is a separate type of book@@ marks within the text . the men@@ Ã ¼ r@@ Ã ¶ ff@@ Ã ¶ ger or the corresponding button @-@ cursor is highlighted , so that it is automatically pre@@ viewed during the first input of a character .
editing is probably one of the main aspects of using a program such as &amp; k@@ ile ; . although &amp; Kate ; already excellent terms , were added in &amp; k@@ ile ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code . &amp; lat@@ ex ; special commands for their selection . under consideration they are included in the following commands :

if the cursor is before or within the command \ \ The begin { setting } is located at the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many fl@@ ach@@ able ambi@@ ent commands can quickly be lost sight . this command slept , t the last modified environment , so that the wel@@ ded ambi@@ ent structure will not be disp@@ at@@ ched .
&amp; k@@ ile ; also offers special orders for the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; groups , which are determined by br@@ aces { ... } respectively . under Be@@ am Te@@ X @-@ group are a few important statements that correspond to Be@@ am environment .
with this command , the start of the current group is sung ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed right in front of the swe@@ eping bracket .

when entering a new environment using the command \ \ beginning { surroundings } , &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically add the command \ \ end { surroundings } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
when entering the return key , the last letter is removed from the entry and enables complete surrender . on the other hand , the list may be reduced by input of another letter also .
all orders are made with a short description of their parameters . alternatively you can register by &amp; k@@ ile ; also spr@@ ing@@ stamps , so that an easy jump to these positions by means of working spr@@ ing@@ stamps N@@ Ã ¤ n@@ ste spr@@ ing@@ stamps is to be introduced .

the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even may have little to do with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even if the plugin system will benefit immediately and do not wait until someone will use the gun in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; built . the plugins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements . more about it they find further below .
to install a plugin or a K@@ Part , we begin to work with the menu plug @-@ ins . thus , the following dialogue will be opened :
this dialog allows to manage all of the plugins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; item in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding the plugins without a storage place &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path to search of the plug @-@ in .
often working on one project several persons in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship with each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the statement of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project @-@ Properties project .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nickname is the nickname of the user and is used for clear identification .
one member may have several roles in the project as well as a team leader as well as sub@@ project leaders .
the user can look out from the list of team members who he is . this is done by looking out the team member from the list and the button is pressed . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears when you are : text .
nickname and setting of your own identity are important in terms of news and comments . see for further information on notes .
aside from the overview of her team there is another benefit by the collection of the members of the team : it may be an event for information to the team leader when something specific happens . see in for further information .
event actions are actions that can be executed when something specific in the project is happening . an example would be seen how much anyone worked with it , or sending a message when a file is backed up , or a script that will play a file into the CV@@ S , once they are added to the project &amp; etc .
on the page event Con@@ figuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project project settings , events can be created , edited and deleted .
an email will be sent to the list of selected addresses . the address of the address can be a team or sub@@ project leader . see where these leaders are set up .
comments are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
to specify notes is simple . it may either be selected from the note entry from the editor context or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation key word in a comment or by comments text .
notes can be a determining member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nickname ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( roll ) , a role in the project from the following possibilities : team leader Sub@@ project managers should be introduced to the appropriate zone or sub@@ project names , as in the following examples below .
nickname and roll names are independent of large or small @-@ ch@@ arities , but spaces around the brack@@ ets and the : make the note invali@@ d .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and form@@ atting languages , which is D@@ TD Con@@ dition@@ ally and web@@ based form@@ atting and scrip@@ ting languages supported .
the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here you will find only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; specific settings are treated , a brief description for the others can be found in .
the settings can be set by means of Settings Qu@@ anta . diesel dialog can be accessed through some pages that are dealt with each other .
the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for tags including car completion can thus be changed .
large / jewel case of tags : large / low @-@ keeping of automatically added tags . normal Groß / Klein@@ sch@@ ema signi@@ fies , the tags will be in@@ inserted as described in the day XML files .
large / Classifieds of attributes : large / Klein@@ sch@@ ein@@ gs of automatically added attributes . regular Large / Klein@@ sch@@ ein@@ gs means , the attributes are inserted as inserted as they are described in the day XML files .
optional tags automatically include : if p@@ act , becomes optional for tags , for which the exclusive day is optional , this immediately added to the &amp; gt ;
not optional tags will automatically include : as above for all other tags , except the simple tags .
starting and finish tag automatically update : when switched , the corresponding day is changed and vice versa .
automatic adjustment of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of the plac@@ ental sign in the corresponding coding during the inser@@ tion .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ ics types for detection of different types of files . by means of the standard , the default values can be restored .
standard re@@ coding : the coding of newly created or in other way than with file opening files ( where the en@@ coding of the file can be passed over ) . however , this attitude here is being loaded from the same in the project properties , if a project is loaded .
standard D@@ TD : the selected D@@ TD will be used for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ TD has not been recognized . this setting here will however extend from the same in the project properties , if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; created regularly backup copies , so that with a black@@ out or crash the next start of the program can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file . even if not stored documents is created a backup regularly , according to the specified time , created .
the preview and documentation can either be displayed in the editor area or your own view ( or the documentation in a box ) , what makes it possible , the documentation , the preview and the source code at the same time .
set up the window frames to the default at the next start is useful when the user interface has come through modi@@ fying the MDI modes and an@@ do@@ cks / depend on views to each other . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout Command system parameters .
the warning fe@@ ed@@ backs serves the control of the possibility of un@@ lock the display of war@@ nings by the h@@ acks of no longer .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can be displayed by symbols instead of scripts as well as the syn@@ op@@ tic behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source code in shared mode . as regards the different modes .
here the par@@ ser and the structural tree , which represents the illustration of the par@@ ser node in the document to be set in details .
in the area of mouse @-@ click on the structural @-@ tree causes the following action is possible to change by clicking the structural tree with the drop @-@ in action .
in the area of structural @-@ settings the visibility of no@@ des in the tree can be opened automatically , adjusted . blank kn@@ ots are automatically opened in the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are not found in the current document there is no element found in the current document .
the area for setting up the abbrevi@@ ations of abbrevi@@ ations ( one type of templates ) that can be divided into groups , each can be divided for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s may be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s means it can be a valid group for PHP , in which the if@@ of abbrevi@@ ation may be considered in a group valid for Javascript .
here you can manage the plugins . plugins are K@@ Part @-@ Application from third page , which can be re@@ used by each K@@ Part @-@ enabled application , on the most famous &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ ins , the following is required :
address : the path to the plugin if it is not at a stand there as $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib .
input : this information will pass the plug @-@ in at the start , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
component in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Only @-@ L@@ ese &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mode load : check if the plugin denied the store . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ parts usually refuse the store if this option is not chosen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
veri@@ fied the plugin : is this activated , then test@@ a &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if the given information is correct . pick the deposit even if the plugin is not available for the moment , but it will be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , the de@@ bug@@ ging was completely re@@ designed . di@@ version for the no more necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ ug@@ ger was implemented , as well as the support for the DB@@ G de@@ bu@@ gger . instead of it , a de@@ bu@@ gger @-@ Plugin concept was implemented , which allows different implem@@ entations about plugins .
currently only a plugin available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; in@@ qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; added .
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . with the button options next to the de@@ bu@@ gger @-@ plug @-@ in selection , the specific settings can be changed .
if a de@@ bu@@ gger project uses a de@@ bu@@ gger , some additional elements appear at the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; interface :
a view displayed in which the contents of monitored variables is displayed . normally , in the left @-@ left dock .
a view where all holding points , with reference to and conditions are listed , usually in the lower dock .
a view in which the output is shown ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger . usually , in the lower dock .
depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything is available or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger , if necessary , or she shares the plugin with , based on Deb@@ u@@ gan@@ tries . this action will be triggered by default when a project is open , which must not be considered a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that it must not be worth it .
the counter@@ part to Deb@@ ug@@ gen session starts the session . closes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or ends the lu@@ gs to requirements .
sends a HTTP requirement to the server to initi@@ ate a de@@ bug request . this is also syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to see the current document . the issue of this requirement is shown in the view de@@ bu@@ gger issue .
points to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger to start the execution of the script and to continuously send out information about the surveillance variables , as well as the currently executed on line . if this happens , when the script is hal@@ ted , the execution is continued before a debut requirement was started , the script starts with the request .
points to the de@@ bu@@ gger , with the execution of the script , without information to send out variables and current tick @-@ number . if this happens , while a script is hal@@ ted , the execution continues . happens before a debut requirement was given , begins the execution as soon as a requirement is made .
the Deb@@ ug@@ ger leads to the next statement on the script without going into the functions or process .
the Deb@@ ug@@ ger leads the next statement on the script when possible into functions and re @-@ related messages .
points to the de@@ bu@@ gger to pass the statement and go to the next so as if there is not the current one .
opens a dialog , where a variable or an expression can be entered , which shall be monitored . the surveillance value appears in the variable view .
this dialog can be added to a variable or a new value of a variable .

this chapter describes how you can adapt &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to suit your needs and how you can help us to become better .
document type E@@ di@@ pet package ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used to provide support for Mark@@ up@@ - and scrip@@ ting languages as well as &amp; CSS ; they allow &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; skills such as car @-@ completion and IDE ; a quick , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s there are two types , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages and &amp; CSS ; . &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are made up of two parts , the day folder and the toolbar .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing D@@ TD . see for details for conversion .
this document describes how to create the XML files , then the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also toolbar . in short , one &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ;
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attri@@ bute for tags as well as the layout and content of the property analysis , the &amp; qu@@ int@@ ran@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for the day , the tool contains a fast editing of tags in a document without risk of writing .
Tag Program@@ mes are nothing but folder . they contain only the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the XML files . day folders carry the name of the description language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.01 points )
the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML and de@@ co@@ ded whether they are necessary or not . although not all necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have better insight and more information when working with them .
the following chapter describes every element in detail . everything about the possibilities and boundaries is explained in a simple way .
that is the root element of a conference document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but as only the element type has nothing else than itself anything else .
the type of tags is a script feature . when used , &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument in function . ( only family 2 )
only for the conference type class valid . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only for the type of input cells . returns the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the day has a development attri@@ bute group and the attributes inside these tags can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 )
sets up a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; -@@ day . this is a single element of element .
describes a attri@@ bute of a tags . this item can occur once for each attri@@ bute . it puts the name and type of the attri@@ bute being fixed . additionally , it contains other tags that should describe how this attri@@ bute should be shown &amp; etc ; This is an only element element .
returns the source materials used for the attributes in the day editorial dialog and the attri@@ bute @-@ tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used for reaching source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p methodology within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a pattern , and a method name . the arguments that can be handed over to the method . may be empty or on @-@ name % , which means the name of the current tags .
a container day group@@ ed the elements of a list together . it can occur for an attri@@ bute description only once . it is a single element type element .
sets the position of the attri@@ bute of a tags within a dialog box . this day can happen for each attri@@ bute in a dialogue only once ( e.g. once for each one &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; -@@ day ) . the item is empty .
returns the position and size of a field in dialogue . this day should be present for each field in dialogue even ( e.g. one for each and lt ; att@@ r &gt; und &amp; lt ; label &gt; Day ) . this item is empty .
returns a list of elements that may occur inside the tags . this item is an element type .
returns a list of elements that end a day . this item is an element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with an &amp; XML ; -@@ De@@ visu@@ alisation : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 en@@ coding = U@@ TF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be neat and closed .
id@@ ols do not affect anything , but pay attention to &amp; and &amp; lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text can be replaced . this will not cause any ar@@ rest , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check out the conference files , the Tools dialog above in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; window to start and check out Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . to select another dialog will appear to follow its simple instructions .
this feature is currently not yet available . currently , the check is only done when loading the conference file in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ;
in the following an example of a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; sch@@ ema &gt; element from the &amp; W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; sch@@ ema . the file name for this conference file should be sch@@ em@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following an example of a functioning family 2 Tag@@ XML file . this file is described one &amp; PHP ; over@@ la@@ de function . the fil@@ ename of this conference file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; state = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; day &gt;
the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; File is just as easy and there is an editor to be accessible via D@@ TD Bear@@ be@@ ite D@@ TD . with it , di@@ ed@@ es@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created a simple &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created with following entries :
&#91; general &#93; Version = use 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for any higher version . name = D@@ TD &apos;s statement . ( - / / W3@@ C ; / / D@@ TD HTML 4.01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nickname .
a action can set up with settings actions ... click on New Promotion leads to the same dialog :
this is linked with button short@@ cut . by clicking the button custom can be assigned a keyboard short@@ cut ; with one of the current keyboard short@@ cut .
the sim@@ pl@@ est actions . it can be typ@@ ed a text in the detailed settings and when exec@@ uting the action will add this text in the document to the current cursor position . see the example below .
this is the powerful action type . with the help of this action you can use external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) to use the document or as input ( or parts of the document ) . even the quick start -@@ dialog or the different See in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps .
the first must be the name of the script and interpre@@ ter . for example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ scripts . sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % fre@@ eb@@ ase variable in the command line : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ PAT@@ H There are other special variable which can be used in the command line :
% f : we will be replaced with the URL of the current document . in the event of a local document is file : / from the document name .
% PID : will be replaced with the P@@ GD of the ongoing &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance is running , the text is unique to the PID @-@ number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; by the external script .
the parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ ename of the current document or the path to the project @-@ file .
in addition to the above methods , a script can be sent from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to the default input . in the selection field input can be determined , which is to be sent to the default input .
selected text : the selected section of the document will be sent to the script . the % input variable is usually advisable only with this setup .
according to the input can also be re@@ directed to the output of the application , there are two types of output : normal output , based on the default transmission . it may be specified , what the default column can be specified by the default box :
if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups . it is necessary to create a toolbar for each group . in the given case , it is not too many , therefore one can create a toolbar with the name of the market .
once a toolbar is added , you must add and configure actions . select Settings actions .
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the Neue Action button at the bottom of the window starts the Edit Mode .
fill in all the required fields and add them to the matching toolbar .
complete everything and , if the tag has attributes , and you plan their use , activate a dialog &quot; Day , &quot; if available , so that an entry into using the action is possible .
Ig@@ or ! is this a ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol ? replace it before we have difficulty .
to create a symbol , that the action is better represented , we will use &amp; c@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; choose from the &amp; k@@ menu ; , graphics other programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) .
&amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size .
please note that the created symbol not only helps you to remember what the action does , but also all the other users of the D@@ TE@@ P ;
with regard to that the day start , means I decided to create a laun@@ cher as a symbol . through the use of green ( green is usually interpreted as loose , died , or should at least , an message to the user sign@@ alized that click this symbol a &amp; lt ; start@@ led ; start the day in the current document .
after creating the symbol it must be linked to the action . this happens via the menu with Settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selecting the desired action . next to the text field is a button , press it .
select the folder in which the stored icon is located , select it and confirm with the OK button .
click the applied button and continue it with other tags , so there is still which gives or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some usual &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; functions to work toolbar or it should adjust this to better overview by some separ@@ ators in several groups . open the toolbar and adjust dialog on settings toolbar . make sure that the desired toolbar is selected .
I want to choose the separ@@ ator ( completely left above ) for my toolbar , which is to be added to the toolbar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the toolbar .
for example , I want to add a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or Pre@@ view . I will select it and add to the toolbar .
please note , as the separ@@ ator aid the group@@ ing . someone who does not know my toolbar , could believe that the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button the opposite of the start push .
the new toolbar has to be tested using all symbols tested to ensure that everything works .
secure into the correct folder . after Neu@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be saved in the right folder but your toolbar ( s ) should be loaded in the right folder . please adjust their work toolbar ( s ) , when a file is opened by the corresponding type .
perhaps the men@@ tioning extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the form@@ atting language that you like most . therefore , this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; document marks for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory , whether someone has done it for you .
there are two parts in this process . first , you have to search a existing documentation for form@@ atting / script / etc . language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . we leave the first part to you , the second part we treat here .
# KDE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = Path , relatively to this file , for example image Section 1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Section 2 = Sec@@ tion@@ html Sec@@ tions = Sec@@ tion@@ 2.@@ html
the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the document tree . for example , you see now in the &amp; PHP ; documentation so something :
# KDE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level = Table of Cont@@ ents = index.html
take note of the # before starting the Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known fron@@ tier for chess training ( except through reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
you notice that the directory is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and more consequ@@ ential at the top end of the track record &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is displayed ! ) .
id@@ ols affect nothing but pay attention to &amp; and &amp; lt ; character . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; res@@ ourc@@ ef@@ at@@ eien will be replaced .
the content section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which is used for the design of the context @-@ sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; script for context @-@ help the documentation would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file connectors .
a simple list of mod@@ eled context @-@ elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; ) these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c to save your file do@@ cr@@ c / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( such as you can write this in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
if you are sure that this well and it is worth to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation have been used to be rich in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Structure . you will not be rich , but proud to have worked on the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; are you not alone . it is possible to divide the resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , toolbar with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can send by e @-@ mail to friends , partners or else to anyone . at different places there is an e @-@ mail menu entry , such as D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with e @-@ mail , toolbar toolbar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in scripts .
the resources can be up@@ loaded into our main archive , from where all the other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; users can download it . the contributions are reviewed and only available when our team needs them as accurate and us@@ eless for publishing . in order to make use of the resources it provides a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . thus , the origin of the resources is guaranteed , both for our team and for the later users .
when up@@ loading , you are asked for their private G@@ PG key after their private G@@ PG page ( the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the case that you have multiple keys you can submit a search . in the dialog New resource you need to empty the input fields ( URL Pre@@ view can be empty ) and with clicking OK the up@@ loading program will be started .
the up@@ loading can upload from the menus D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , toolbar toolbar , and in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts .
after downloading a resource , still before installation , investigated &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the ir@@ reconc@@ ile of the resource by checking of integrity and sig@@ nat@@ ing . please note the warning messages carefully . if the integrity has been given and the resource correctly appears , a message appears with the specification of the author of the resource .
it is possible to work in XML languages , which is currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it is necessary to work by creating a D@@ TE@@ P package . it gives the easiest way to convert a D@@ TD automatically into a D@@ TE@@ P package .
the transformation can be started by the D@@ TD Download menu and Convert D@@ TD . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the D@@ TD description which is to be used . afterwards the following dialogue will appear :
target directories : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; will be written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / apps / qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! Doc@@ type definitions : the string found in the ! Doc@@ type Tag , such as HTML PU@@ BLI@@ C - / / W3@@ C / / D@@ TD HTML 4.01 Transi@@ tional / / EN http : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / ht@@ ml@@ 4 / lo@@ os@@ e.@@ dt@@ d
fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if activated , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after the transformation the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; -@@ Editor , with the details of newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to utilize this possibility .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; there are some key concepts . to understand this and take full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; therefore , one must first give them to this fundamental concepts . this chapter tries to bring them exactly these concepts , without their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; little uses .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the working area is divided into three main areas : global , locally and proj@@ ections . this distinction involves a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ;
global elements are available for each , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; uses , available . by materials , it is all that is a global folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this enables the group of administr@@ ators to secure different toolbar , actions and patterns in the global tree , which will then be available in a multi @-@ user environment .
local elements present a personal collection of web development for a single user . they are user @-@ specific patterns and toolbar . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are available only within a specific project . this can be done from &amp; CSS ; pattern up to toolbar size with special actions especially for the files of a particular project . just said , this is the most restricted size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which provides common use of special tools and patterns on all employees within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; MDI ; consists of some main areas : the Edit@@ orial , the ads with information and the toolbar . please refer to , and for further information on these areas .
you can click the cart@@ on with the right mouse button to re@@ load a context menu with the current documentation , re@@ load , delete or upload the document , jump to a bookmark or version of CV@@ S commands to current document .
right @-@ click in the editorial department lead to a further context menu regarding the edited document contents , how basic editing steps ( to cut / copy / paste ) , edit under the mouse po@@ inter or opening the file , when the string under the mouse @-@ cursor is referred to a file .
at the top end of the editors , the tool shows . at present &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.01 Transi@@ tional as standard has been shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the tool shows the new functions and related user needs .
the use of toolbar is really easy . if they want to insert a simple tag , e.g. &amp; lt ; p@@ gt ; in their document then click on the icon that has to insert the day . now , they can insert the data for this just added day ( like anchor ) , you can insert in a dialogue different fields .
the buil@@ ders ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow it to navigate in the information about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to navigate it and pass through . in the display with boxes are available for files , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation .
project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; prepared this view shows all the files in the project and allows managing files in the project by means of right mouse click . actions like adding , un@@ loading , upload or del@@ eting the files from the storage media can be performed with the displayed context menu .
another chance of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . nearly everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc ; It will be open to you all possibilities .
templates can be divided into three categories , depending on how to use it . the category is always available , local Templates are available only for relevant users and templates in projects are available only in the project . more about templates is in .
here you will find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of re@@ integration in Global , Local and Project also works here . by clicking on the left mouse button you can call the available information to a script , such as the script to start editing or send with E@@ Mail .
with this view one shows the internal structure of the active document . through links @-@ clicking of the tab , the cursor is set in the document to the position of the element . through right @-@ clicking of an item , a list of commands in relation to navigation and re@@ fres@@ her of the tree .
this tree appears among the other buildings . with it , you can change attri@@ bute and nam@@ ing rooms . the modification of all available attributes allows you to change all the available attributes with just a few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation to find the web @-@ technology for your development . there can be pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &quot; document site can be created , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be added to project specific documentation , edi@@ c and regards .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; two kart@@ ei@@ re@@ iter at the bottom of the window , can be reached via the beneficial information : the message window and the problem windows .
this cart@@ on displays information about each in Qu@@ anta running script . for example , the D@@ TD current document and all modifications are displayed to D@@ TD .
this cart@@ on displays all errors in Mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; scripts that will be executed , all messages ( so there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; tool shows are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they get the corresponding command displayed . the Chocolate on the tool is the possibility to define own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ;
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a toolbar of e @-@ mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; sends the toolbar as a com@@ pressed tar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; . when they receive a toolbar , they can secure it in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; like any other back and invite you !
it is reasonable , if you want to adjust the place of &amp; qu@@ antine ; -@@ files on your system . for this , auto@@ conf have a number of options that can be handed over to the configure script . to provide a complete list of all options , enter . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not executed .
if you have problems with starting from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; you should check if your path is the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder contains . also , you should make sure that there is no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in PAT@@ H in front of their bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for KDE finish . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; was optimized for a rapid web development and combines a fully developed development environment with a variety of powerful features .
during the effort to create the best &amp; HTML ; -@@ Editor , began the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; an independent , expand@@ able mark@@ up @-@ language editor ? well , this would make him an absolutely great web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
not longer on re@@ ines &amp; HTML , limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now it is already far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . together , if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then should be &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for this can be the appropriate &amp; IDE ;
well , to the above @-@ mentioned claim must be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product is based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; develop@@ ement community is , in good application of free software , the idea of Why developers have developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ s@@ caff@@ old is not only this possible , but it allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; so to expand how they need it for their needs .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; facilit@@ ates the use of a intui@@ tive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( MDI ; ) . this can increase productivity dramatically . by means of self @-@ stri@@ cken actions , scripts and toolbar . through the program Kom@@ mer you can notice &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ( more about it can be found in . )
&amp; qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment designed for HTML and related languages . it was designed for rapid web development and was quickly expanded to a mature editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of &amp; qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program .

a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list may be changed every time you open a file , which is not located on it , whereby the oldest entry is taken .
this allows you to save code pieces and whole files as templates for later use . look in the section about templates . should they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project pre@@ condition row , only one mistake is reported .

remove a toolbar from the view area . the del@@ etes it from the hard disk . if you have not saved the toolbar , you will be asked if you want to do it .
this allows you to send their own toolbar to someone ( maybe to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ team so that the toolbar is present in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as an app@@ endi@@ x .
enables the up@@ loading of toolbar on the main server , where everyone can access it . see in .
download a &amp; D@@ TD , who made you or anything else , and convert into the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own sound @-@ format .
loading / refresh the En@@ ti@@ ties from the &amp; D@@ TD ; It makes sense when the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; be refresh@@ ed without the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this globally is and a writing permission in the Global KDE folder is not present , failed the store .
this menu contains a list of tags at present materials . if the standard is loaded ( HTML ; ) toolbar is available in the tags menu a sub @-@ menu standard , which contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar .
allows access to the current day configuration dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the menu tags , followed by &amp; D@@ TD ; -@@ specific sub@@ men@@ tions .
activated or dis@@ ables the intelligent editing of tags . currently this only works with ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ ting means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; inser@@ ting the inser@@ ting pattern when this day contradi@@ cts the rules .
in the plug @-@ in @-@ ins menu the available plugins are listed under the menu points above . click here . click on an active plugins disabled .
select the syn@@ taxes mode for the current file . the list of available her@@ b@@ ush@@ k@@ sch@@ em@@ ata is based on b@@ k@@ ate ; version .
sel@@ ects the type of tick @-@ characteristics . very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms to wrap . select Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
checks the syntax of the current document based on the selected &amp; D@@ TD , using the external application of tidy .
immediate switching between the different types of interface . by some limitations in the KDE @-@ libraries can cause switching times or un@@ nice graphics . recommended is the cartridge mode which is also the default mode , which is also the default mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and sooner .
in addition , this menu contains an entry for each open window . with a selection of an account the corresponding sub@@ window will be activated .
enables the status of the status bar at the bottom of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; Haupt@@ f@@ enst@@ ers or from .
the changes in this dialog are influenced every application that use the K@@ HTML @-@ Part , including the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; Web@@ browsers .
Set the behavior of the editor . in the documentation of &amp; Kate ; you can find details .
a dialog appears when you delete items from the toolbar or how to change and sequ@@ ences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this should generate a help according to the background of the mouse cursor , but is not yet implemented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high quality product that is freely available and free , but as with any open source project , the developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form you will find the way .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be filled with the top from top to bottom , since for example after filling the project called the whole directories structure will be automatically completed for the rest of the project . all these paths and author expres@@ sions can be adjusted later with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project characteristics .
here is the name for the project to enter , for example fo@@ o . when entering name it is automatically filled .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; project @-@ file . by default , it has the name of the project in small letters and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can connect the Server@@ address of the machine to which you connect , unless you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exempl@@ ary ) or an IP @-@ address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
lets this field blank , the default settings are used for the selected log . depending on the adjustment of the remote host could be an adaptation needed .
this is the folder where the templates will be stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default . if a common collection of files is used for various projects , this folder should be set rather than the standards .
this is the folder where the tool can be saved for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files is used for various projects , this folder should be set rather than the standards .
this allows to insert files from the local file system into the project . you can select multiple files or whole folder .
this setting is great if you have static web@@ in@@ halt you can download and change . in a different script ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
act P@@ act if files , which are located somewhere in the main folder of the project , should be involved . if a project is started new , non @-@ hook .
with this option all the files and folders will be displayed within the main folder and you can make a precise selection of paint @-@ thin .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by h@@ ook@@ aken or , by removing the tick , cl@@ amps off the project .
the final screen of the new project wiz@@ ard includes three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be up@@ loaded in the menu with project @-@ properties in the men@@ acle window or be changed with the short@@ cut Shift ; F@@ 7 .
some settings meet those in the project wiz@@ ard and they are described in . additional items will be explained below .
a list of fil@@ ename ( plac@@ eholder possible ) , which are re @-@ introduced in the @-@ related operations such as project ord@@ al @-@ related operations .
add option to top , also files that are listed in .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project .
the project view that is charged when opening the project . in more than project views can be read .
with this , the desired Deb@@ ug@@ ger can be chosen . currently , only Gu@@ bed supports . more information about Gu@@ bed can be set in . the Deb@@ ug@@ ger Plugin can be set with the Options window .
in the sub @-@ window profiles , Up@@ la@@ de@@ profile ( see also be set ) , as well as the display of a tree @-@ view for the content of the server for each profile , creating a proper supervision for each profile .
in the sub @-@ window configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details .
in the fore@@ going event , one can turn off event actions and add these actions to change or delete them . event transactions are executed when a previously mentioned event occurs , such as the f@@ uses of a file . see in the details .
by default and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the last project that was open . this behavior is currently not possible to influence .
to open another project , select Project ... from the menu project or the icon project opening out the toolbar . the dialogue project will be displayed and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; closed , the project @-@ file will be automatically saved . you are asked if you want to save changes before leaving , if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project .
the project management gives free access to files in the project . there , the files can be managed in the current project .
folders will be used , however the entries can be opened and opening with the right mouse button in the context menu :
here you can search different profiles . the profile contains information about the place of the up@@ loaded files . see .
allows removing the current profile . if only one profile is present , the button is hidden to prevent the removal .
the password will keep in the core memory and forget about programs . this possibility is useful when frequent re@@ load files is needed and the more un@@ secure password is stored on the disk -@@ option not come into question .
this will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialog until you change your mind from the up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; many high loads profiles can be up@@ loaded and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be up@@ loaded to various servers . when working or creating a profile , this dialog displays :
this is the name of the server to be copied to the files . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address function .
the transfer protocol for the up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed KI@@ O slaves . at least , you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( locally ) and n@@ fs .
the port for transfer . normally , this must not be changed except the network administrator does not operate a service at the usual port .
depending on your att@@ un@@ lock , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it according to your discretion . the password will be saved on the disk so that it can not be easily read , but each with programming results can be easily seen in plain text .
a project view is only one set of files and toolbar . it can be loaded in a project many views , i.e. by simple exchange of view , various files and toolbar must be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbar .
views can be saved in the menu project or the project toolbar , accessible via settings of toolbar project toolbar , open or deleted .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; with which one has most to do . this helps not only increase productivity but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to its own working method .
as mentioned above are toolbar icons in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; best deals with the menu of toolbar . use and Ad@@ ding differ . the addition of toolbar is treated down in the section Ad@@ ding toolbar .
the toolbar icons and the symbols can either be set by using the context menu ( right @-@ click on the toolbar ) , there may be other promotions as toolbar , toolbar or toolbar , which can be shown in the dialog , where actions can be visible on this or other toolbar .
by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a toolbar , in addition , the entries will remove and action to be processed , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool shows and the actions on them can set up with settings toolbar and set settings .. set .
templates are in essentially visual editing , code car@@ ni@@ p and files to the link . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used templates such as a program file system with expanded organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or install any of the system available in the storage space . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in approximately the restrictions you imagine for the fil@@ es@@ ystem .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; provided designs have conditions for their use . please read the conditions attached at the beginning of each template prior to use exactly .
bin@@ ary is all that is not pur@@ pos@@ eful text . it can be installed every file except text , so images , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; bin@@ ary templates are usually included in documents using link@@ ages ( e.g. pictures with im@@ g src = / src / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the storage room under global templates . additional information about templates is available in documents .
documents can be created by any text document . based on these templates , new documents can be created . normally , a simple s@@ caff@@ old for the purpose and organiz@@ es the work in appropriate way to be efficient . some examples can be found in the storage room under global templates . see in for more information about templates .
this kind of templates is useful if not a new document will be inserted based on a template but the same text area again . you can find everything from a comment on a final note up to a complete quantity system on Javascript or Perl base . some examples are in the storage room under global templates . see in for more information about templates .
as the name says , these are used for whole sites as templates . they are a collection of various documents , which can be organized in a folder structure , together in a com@@ pressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ;
create a document structure by means of choice ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc . ) and select File As a template save as local submission ...
once that has been done , notice that ( even if it was recorded as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look at the pre @-@ tree under project templates .
select text in your document and click File As a template to store selection as a local / project template . alternatively , the selection may be drag@@ ged with or@@ nam@@ ing and attach it to the construction of building templates .
the creation of bin@@ ary templates is simple : the file can only copy into one folder folder . it can be used all file management functions , such as or@@ to@@ es and paste or inser@@ ting about the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
you can select inside the file tree or in the project files building blocks to a folder on the right and backup site template , backed up a name for the template and secure it . by default , it will be stored as local or global template .
project templates enable a very pur@@ pos@@ eful occurrence . you can insert head@@ lines and foot@@ lines or connect them dynam@@ ically with them . additionally you can keep some things while using templates in projects very deep in mind .
the storage structure in the sub @-@ window templates is based on the in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / load and $ HOME / .@@ k@@ de / share / qu@@ anta / on@@ loading / co@@ qu@@ eri@@ ed files . each of this folder corresponds to one of four types of container , as explained above .
to specify the behavior of a folder overview with the right mouse button on the folder and select the context menu features . the following dialog appears :
a selection of the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection has been canc@@ eled , as soon as the el@@ ective attributes is de@@ ed .
this is enabled by default and fits all except the stem folders in this path , unless they were explicitly enabled in this path , unless they were explicitly activated . in case of a normal folder , the bl@@ ah would appear with something like text @-@ item . if nothing appears , you probably have to be in a stem folder .
permits or presented text for templates in this folder . these could be general head@@ lines or foot@@ ers for all templates for a particular project and enables complete presentation to equi@@ p a whole presentation with the right head@@ lines / foot@@ ers .
in addition , you can press ( click on the right mouse button ) through a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and paste from templates from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; Source text editor , which are accessible via the Edit menu . the first mode re@@ places the editor text editor in two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor .
the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor works as follows : he invites a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; XHTML ; -@@ page and a cursor . then you can edit and turn back into the source code editor in which the changes made changes are visible in the V@@ PL ; Editor in the source code .
when working with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor on a document , which includes PHP ; contains a small green symbol the V@@ oh@@ and@@ ision of &amp; PHP ; source code . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor . to edit the source text editor . there is no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works exactly like the first , except that the changes are displayed both in the source Editor and the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor is already active , this mode is already active , enables the pressing fire the active cursor of a window to the other , whereby the position in the document will be maintained .
the synchroni@@ zation distance between the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and the source code device can be set by synchroni@@ zation after a click or automatically . in the selection automatically you can be set between synchroni@@ zation after a click or automatically . in principle the recommendation is automatically set to be adjusted for fast calcul@@ ators and a big margin for slow .
suppose you want to change the title of the website , so tools of document characteristics are possible . thus , the editing of un@@ visible tags at work with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor is also being created when a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor is also being created . this is serving the dist@@ ress of the V@@ PL . this allows you to change the following :
met@@ a @-@ tags give the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for internet search engines . met@@ a @-@ elements can be added by pressing the two buttons below or removed . a click into the list allows modification of the content , such as keywords on the column name and key@@ word key@@ word 2 on the content @-@ column .
CSS @-@ rules are the new way of designing the appearance of pages in your browser . you can add or delete CSS @-@ rules with the buttons below the list is just as possible with the met@@ a @-@ elements . the editing of CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS @-@ style template by clicking on the file @-@ open button and select the appropriate file .
the usage of the cursor is as usual in a text processing , possible through loading with the arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the cursor works as usual . text can be inserted by typ@@ ing and deleted using call@@ back or remove unwanted effects .
the inser@@ ting tags will be made in the same way via the tool @-@ gl@@ az@@ ing , as in the source text editor , it &apos;s noted that the inser@@ ting tags at previously available identical tags are not removed , e.g. a anchor tag , which is inserted with text must be removed every other surrounding p@@ endant day .
some toolbar icons like the tables Assistant or the lists @-@ wiz@@ ard are disabled . you will later work in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release the tables or lists must be used .
&amp; x@@ sl@@ db@@ g ; is a tool for examination of styl@@ istic templates . in contrast to other programs for styl@@ istic templates , the search for certain elements is possible and the performance of the style template can be pursued .
to compile &amp; x@@ sl@@ db@@ g ; successfully re@@ comp@@ iling , except &amp; k@@ de ; nor the libraries lib@@ x@@ sl@@ t , li@@ bex@@ sl@@ t and lib@@ x@@ ml , which are present in a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ;

x@@ sl@@ db@@ g det@@ ects the full path from a fil@@ ename with a file name . fil@@ ename in the same folder as the top loaded style template using x@@ sl@@ db@@ g is loaded for example a styl@@ istic storage column .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ sl is the following input possible :
this command will be checked for partial or complete compliance with a specified name called QNAP ME or a specified model name . &amp; eg ; template is right with every QNAP ME , which contains the character template .
&quot; &quot; &quot; any nam@@ esp@@ ace in the given &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; QNAP &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rules specified by the rules specified by the X@@ SL source file : test@@ 1 will be added &amp; eg ; extended to http : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 199 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a do@@ able holding point must be resolved for the related UR@@ I and Z@@ eil@@ ing number . this is automatically re@@ done when loading the first template by x@@ sl@@ db@@ g . holding points will be re @-@ checked shortly after starting a cycle .

start a shell . enter the &amp; x@@ sl@@ db@@ g ; command &quot; help &quot; to get an overview of the help .
adds the parameter to the name &amp; lt ; NA@@ ME@@ gt ; and the value &amp; lt ; VAL@@ U@@ E@@ gt ; to the X@@ SL environmental variables . see also the documentation for the command &quot; add@@ par@@ am &quot;
introduces the conversion 20 times when --@@ repeat two times , the conversion will run 100 times
the input documentation is treated as HTML files when the support for it has been activated in lib@@ x@@ ml .

on systems with installed Read@@ line library you can work with the arrow buttons at / off through the running memory of the previous orders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; several commands require more than an argument . quotes have been used to compile aggreg@@ ates than one argument . &amp; eg ; : with the command &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BAR _ @ quot ; &quot; as argument is a holding @-@ point in a file called &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BAR _ @ quot ; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
template _ NA@@ ME : a valid name of a template , which consists only from the ASCII character 0@@ x@@ 00 to 0@@ x@@ 7@@ F . this name can be a fully qualified name as &quot; X@@ SL : tem@@ plat@@ e@@ Name . &quot;
fil@@ ename : a valid local file name on the system of user . at Uni@@ x@@ - or cy@@ g@@ win systems may the name the pre@@ fix &quot; ~ &quot; as short form for personal folders . on RI@@ SC @-@ OS systems are also further environmental variables .
path : a path to the changes of the working folder . on some operating systems , the pre@@ fix &quot; ~ &quot; will be replaced by the path to your personal folder .

there are many graphical tools for compar@@ isons . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain why I wrote .
the inter@@ change was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors had done many changes and at the same time fixes the em@@ itting . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file , and the result were numerous conflicts in the inter@@ connecting .
the program used for me only showed me the modified lines , but I could not see what exactly changed within these lines . and there was no references to places where perhaps only the reverse had changed . the mer@@ ging of these changes was a small night@@ mare .
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could be differences within one line and changes to white signs . later , a lot of other useful functions have been added .
for example , if you want to compare for example quickly , simply copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board and paste it into one of the compar@@ isons window .
a function that made a lot of work was the compar@@ ing and merge of folders . this function changed &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost in a fully @-@ filled file browser .
also 3 @-@ way merge is fully supported . this is useful when two people can work independently of each other at one piece of co@@ es and make changes . the original file is facilit@@ ated by using proper modifications . the assem@@ bling sub @-@ buttons allows you to edit the result . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly . the screen@@ shot shows three Qu@@ ell files by mer@@ ging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you in the same and assem@@ bling complete folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folder mer@@ ging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and de@@ tri@@ mental to the possibilities of today &apos;s shades . if you have to check frequently co@@ de , you will like this feature .
differences in white signs and t@@ abo@@ ators are visible . if the lines are only in a certain number of white signs , one can see this at a glance at the summary in the left side of the left . ( no hass@@ le more if J@@ em@@ and the reverse . )
if a file is equal , and the other is different in a row , then displays the color that file is different . red color means that both files differ .
if all files have the same name , but in various folders , you can make the ti@@ pping work easier by just write the fil@@ ename of the first file completely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ diff@@ 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 @-@ diff@@ 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 3 Ord@@ folder
the Open dialog allows the manual type of file names , the selection of the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a recently opened file from the opening list . you don &apos;t have to specify the third file for the next time . you don &apos;t need to specify the entry for C , the analysis of the differences with two files will be carried out .
through the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the same or mer@@ ging of folders will be selected , for B and C , however , a folder , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ ename from A in the two other folders .
if coll@@ ectively , the input field is active and lets itself edit . however , it is not necessarily required to specify immediately a output file . you can get this step later on stor@@ ing .
the inser@@ tion -@@ button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before you start with the same / assem@@ bling .
sometimes you do not want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to select text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board into the active compar@@ ative window . the comparison will then you need not select files , you can simply enter the dialog with the breaking @-@ button .
you can also use drag and drop it : just drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window .
which thought is behind it ? sometimes , a file contains such a few similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these features are , it would only be a relatively great effort . you only need to load two corresponding files , they have to upload and then compare them . now you can copy the relevant sections simply , add and then compare .
note : currently you cannot draw anything from &amp; w@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the case display of text in a comparison window will be supported .
warning : some editors interpre@@ t the to@@ es and set text into another program as out and paste ( instead of copying and paste ) . in such a case , your original data might be lost .
in the upper part of each text window , the info section of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ ename and the Z@@ eil@@ ing number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that the mouse over a file is available , let the mouse to rest a while on the line . then a small Help window will display the full name . )
the three source windows are the letters A , B and C assigned . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed via the Settings menu . )
when a difference is detected , one sees at the color that file is different . if both files differ , the pres@@ et color is especially useful when you compare three files . that &apos;s in the next section ( mer@@ ging ) good to see .
left next to the text is the abstr@@ acts column . if differences were found , the color shows the corresponding paint . in some programming languages the color is not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + e.g. are white signs only in string and comments , relevant for the pre@@ processor and in a few , rare retailers . )
the vertical line , which identi@@ fies the abstr@@ action column of the text , is interrupted by the places where the respective source file has no lines . if the c@@ eil@@ ing is activated , the line is displayed in surrounding lines .
the result window ( under the compar@@ isons ) also has a info @-@ line containing the wording : the fil@@ ename and &#91; changed &#93; if you have edited the result . usually , it contains through the automatic assem@@ bling already texts , but it often contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , the stor@@ k is de@@ activated ! ! ! ( use the buttons jump to closest conflict / ung@@ sten conflict to find even remaining conflicts . )
if only two compar@@ isons are used , each difference is also a conflict which must be solved manually at the same time .
by clicking on the left mouse button in one of the windows that belonged to the line group in all windows , and the first line of the group is shown . ( thus , this group will then be visible the current group . it is highlighted in the color background color for the current range and on the left appears a black @-@ called beam .
sometimes by the automatic co @-@ operation or by manual work no further line is left in the group ; there is only a place of space for the event that you change your opinion and maybe you choose another source . this text does not appear in the final file , nor in a mark@@ er that you might want to copy and do what else .
the text &amp; lt ; quotes ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board if you copy such text from the result window . go gently with this function .
note : if you are interested in selecting the sources the options ignore or Ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white signs .
navig@@ ating mainly with the image drives and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard , you can use the arrow keys left , right , close , close , close and string finish , Si@@ w as you are used also by other programs . the over@@ coming column next to the vertical image line can also be used by clicking on the N@@ avi@@ si@@ fication .
in the Eye window you can also use the other buttons for editing . with the inser@@ tion button you can switch between insert and over@@ loaded mode . ( pres@@ et is the inser@@ tion mode ) .
a click with the left mouse button in one of the abstr@@ acts columns will synchroni@@ ze the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as already in the section and the ed@@ itable output window explained ) .
the toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ below / Str@@ g @-@ Image ) , to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ Image down@@ ward ) or to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ Image down@@ ward ) or to the next / previous conflict . therefore , there must be automatically deleted between sol@@ ves and ung@@ sten conflicts .
to copy the mark@@ ings into the cli@@ p@@ board , you need to press the Copy button ( Str@@ g @-@ C or Str@@ g inser@@ ting ) . if this is enabled , what ever you mark , be copied into the cli@@ p@@ board and be careful , as you could over@@ write so the content of the cli@@ p@@ board .
z@@ eil@@ en@@ ers are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix variants use a single @-@ board sign \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use wag@@ ering \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 re@@ tains the Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ers of source files not on , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not using bin@@ ary files .
the options and the list of the most recently used files will be automatically saved and restored at the next start . ( menu Sett@@ ing@@ s- &gt; K@@ Diff@@ user setup ... )
choose a font with fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog displays writings with variable width to choose from , you should not use them . )
if you enable this option , differences are displayed in cur@@ si@@ ver script . if the chosen characters does not support this representation , nothing happens .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colours could not be available in its pure form , but would be framed on these systems , the button pres@@ enters is automatically an un@@ resolved color .
when this option is activated , the pres@@ sures of the tab@@ ulator button is inserted the corresponding number of spaces . otherwise , a sp@@ ulator is inserted .
if you press the input or return , the default of the previous line will be used automatically for the next line .
when this option is activated , each selection is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . the manual copy into the cli@@ p@@ board will then fall .
you can select which type @-@ end @-@ type you prefer to store . the default value is the generally usual selection of the operating system used .
when using files attempt to find &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , all completely identical lines in the source files . only during this first step may be white signs . in this step , white signs are not ignored . in this step , white signs are not ignored . even when gathering , white signs are not ignored .
some editors ( on certain systems ) save a w@@ agon sign &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , others only save a tick @-@ sliding sign , but then they could be treated with different sizes on the side @-@ side comparison , however , like a white sign . during the inter@@ ruption , this option must be disabled . in the default , this option is disabled .
in default , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated signs ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; - &apos; ) ignored . in the result the differences will be shown , but they are treated like white signs .
in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated like changes in white signs .
intensi@@ vely still searching for smaller differences . this option is activated in default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slowly with very large files .
in Automati@@ cally @-@ Sett@@ ing mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict will continue .
automatically det@@ ach@@ ment all conflicts in white signs by selecting the selected file as a source . if you need this only from time to time , then take advantage of the functions voters A / B / C for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the mer@@ ging menu . note that the automatic selection also involves conflicts in numbers or comments if the options are ignore or Ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + -@@ comments .
these options are treated in the chapter on scanning of folders and pass on a composition . check out the details below documentation for directory comparison and con@@ duction .
if a file is stored and already an older version , the original version contains the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if there is already such back@@ up@@ loaded file with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup .
adap@@ ts the language of the user interface . the amend@@ ment of this option does not affect the currently ongoing program . you must finish &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; finish and re@@ boot that the change becomes active . ( this option is in the KDE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is provided across the control center . )
the following en@@ coding settings can be adjusted for each entry separately . if you have activated this option , the upper setting is used for all entries .
concerning the coding fields for coding appears a short notice , which is the local coding . ( this can not be changed here and has for you purely informal nature . )
adjust the file coding for source files . this affects how special signs are treated and interpreted . as the coding for each file is individually adjustable , even files can be compared and combined with different coding .
if you have edited one file , you can specify which coding is to be used for stor@@ ing .
if you define preliminary processing , you might not be able to work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files might be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the work@@ ing@@ processing can only set with 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option one can specify the coding of the output of processing work@@ m@@ ps .
turn off to push the high@@ lighting of changes in white signs into text or review . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignore or Ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + -@@ comments . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all the differences between two of three files are displayed . but sometimes you wish to see only the differences between two of three files . after selection from A &amp; lt ; gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; in addition , C is shown next to the normal nor a second over@@ see column with the required information .
sometimes you &apos;d prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines . simply select the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
submit the compar@@ isons next to each other or over@@ se@@ ated . this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you consider the differences and then decide to merge the files together . a simple click starts the con@@ duction and uses the fil@@ ename of the last source file as a pres@@ t names for the output file . ( if this function is used to rest@@ art the merge again , then the name of the most recently used output file will be maintained . )
when reading a file it is handed over to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the instruction will be visible , and not the file itself . you can use your own pre@@ processor that is exactly your requirements . you can use this function for example to cut @-@ out parts or rec@@ ti@@ fy the inser@@ tion .
when reading a file it is handed over first to this external command . if a normal pre @-@ processing command is specified ( see above ) , then the output of the instruction will only be used at random , which corresponds exactly your requirements . each input row must have a related issue line .
the idea behind it is to allow users more flexibility when posting the di@@ ff results . however , an external program requires , and most users do not want to program the good news , however , that in most cases sed or per@@ l fully sufficient .
use this process @-@ processing fixed for Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ab@@ als to convert the input into large letters : SE@@ D &apos;@@ s / \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ &apos; The \ \ 1 in the first scale string . the \ \ U thread the found text in large letters .
CV@@ S and other ver@@ sion@@ control systems use some key passwords to automatically insert ( info : / c@@ vs / key@@ word sub@@ stitution ) . all follow the same pattern $ \ \ \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you experiment with å@@ s , you might start to understand it and maybe you may have these regular expres@@ sions even . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
the ignore of numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for another pre @-@ processing fixed for Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ab@@ equally suitable . s / &#91; 0@@ 123@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos;@@ Je@@ des sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is replaced by nothing , so they will be deleted .
sometimes you might want to perform several requirements at one time . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; use to separate the compositions from one another . example :
instead of sed , you can also use something different such as per@@ l . per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / Re@@ placement / switches &apos; allergi@@ es at per@@ l some details different . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) requires per@@ l only ( and ) without the aforementioned &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data according to the normal pre@@ processor will be maintained for viewing and maintain . the further operations only change the data which the Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ab@@ ide @-@ al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ m can be seen .
note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the Z@@ eil@@ en@@ roll@@ out section sees the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function , the text changes or differences hidden , you can not notice certain differences and destroy relevant data in the worst case .
often , programmers have to deal with a folder many files . for this reason you can compare with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folders recur@@ sively compare and merge .
... makes a suggestion for each object to assem@@ ble a suggestion ; you can adjust the proposal before the start ;
... can sim@@ ulate the inter@@ sim@@ ulated and shows the sim@@ ulated changes without being carried out ,
... selected actions with either all ( F@@ 7 button ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is the compar@@ ing and assem@@ bling of individual files very similar . you only need to specify folders at the command line or in the dialog file .
if three folders are mer@@ ged , then folder 1 is used as a base . if no goal folder was specified , used &amp; w@@ diff@@ 3 ; Ord@@ ner@@ 3 as target folder .
note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , not start @-@ up . to start the gathering , you must select the appropriate menu entry or press the F@@ 7 button . ( further details follow . )
while reading the folder you will find a small message window above the current progress . if you ab@@ ort the scanning , only the files listed until then were compared .
when scanning is complete the folder shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left , ...
each file and each folder that was found during the scan will be shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a single click .
the folder structure is normally represented together . you can double a folder by clicking on the + / - click on the object or using the arrow keys for left / right . the directory menu contains two functions all sub@@ directories and select all sub@@ directories with which you can so@@ ap any folders or folders .
if you double click on a file , the file is immediately started and it appears a comparison window .
the icon in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folder , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case the gathering action is not automatically chosen . if the mer@@ ging will be started , you will be informed of problems of this kind again .
as shown in the above image , are used in the columns A / B / C the colors red , Green , Yellow and Black .
for identical entries the colour is also identical , although the age of the entries is different .
folders will be identical as the same if their entire content is identical . then the folder also have the same color . in folders , the age is un@@ significant for its colour .
the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ diff . the colors reflect the colors of a qui@@ ver again which is only green , then yellow is and later , when it is old , red will .
... A and C are identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical , but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C not have the same file type ( e.g. if a folder and B is a file ) : error : contradic@@ tory data types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , the mer@@ ging cannot be started .
... A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if a folder and B is a file ) : error : contradic@@ tory data types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , the mer@@ ging cannot be started .
the mode for synchroni@@ ze is active , if only two folders and no explicit target folder , and if the option directories can be synchroni@@ zed . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action to follow , so that both folders are identical . if for an entry ...
... A and B exist , but not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user looks as the visible fil@@ ename for the output file only B ; directly after the mer@@ ging copy &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B by A. )
when two folders will be mer@@ ged and select the new file instead of co@@ operative ( un@@ certain ) then the date of files and suggests the newer file to copying . if the files are different , but the date is identical .. Wh@@ ile such errors are not eliminated , the mer@@ ging of the folder cannot be started .
during the mer@@ ging a file is processed after the other . you state column shows Fer@@ tig if the mer@@ ging was successful , and according to other reports when something un@@ expected occurred . if the mer@@ ging is finished , you should make a last check and check if the status is all right .
if in the re@@ direc@@ tional method of full analysis is chosen , K@@ Diff@@ user reads more columns , deleted , not white and white conflicts . ( the column for deleted conflicts is only shown when three folders are compared or mer@@ ged . )
you can either merge the currently selected entry ( file or Od@@ ner ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the connections actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start the mer@@ ging .
please note : if you have not specified target folder , then in the three @-@ folder association mode C will be used as the target , in the Two @-@ folder mer@@ ging will be chosen as the target and used when synchroni@@ ze , A and / or B as a goal .
if you have selected a target folder , please check if all entries will be displayed in the target folder , also in the folder structure . there are some options to be ski@@ pped across certain entries . check these options to avoid un@@ ad@@ ful surprises :
to perform all entries : select directory entry / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the keyboard short@@ cut ) . to only perform the current entry : select action from the current element or push F@@ 6 .
if the contradic@@ tory co @-@ types exist still invali@@ d actions , a message appears on the faul@@ ty elements aside . you can then select a valid action .
if you merge all entries , a dialogue window appears with the options run sim@@ ulate and breaking down .
choose sim@@ ulate if you first see what would happen without which really changes will be made . you will then receive a detailed list of all the promotions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then perform certain actions with all entries . if a manual procedure is needed ( running a single file ) , then a mer@@ ging window will open ( note the screen@@ shot ) .
if you are ready to start with a file , select again folders / continue , or press F@@ 7 . if you have not saved it , a corresponding dialog . then leads &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; continue working with the next entry .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ use ; on an error messages , a message appears and detailed status of information . at the end of the list you will see some messages that will help you to select the cause of the problem or to ski@@ p the problem entry or to solve the problem in another way before you proceed to the assem@@ bling .
if some of the entries were individually gathered , such entries ( in the current session ) and leads them further together again . even if here the mer@@ ging was ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries are considered settled . only if you change the mer@@ ging action , these entries will again be mer@@ ged again .
the Settings menu of &amp; K@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ user setup ... ) now has a section called directory @-@ con@@ duction with these options :
only files that appear on the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree . separate the pattern with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid credit card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e. g . * .c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default value is * .
files and folders contained in this pattern are not shown in the elementary tree ; there may be more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid credit card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . pres@@ etting is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders contained in this pattern are not shown in the elementary tree ; there may be more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid credit card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . pres@@ etting is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignored files that are also ignored by CV@@ S . many aut@@ mati@@ cally created files are ignored by CV@@ S . the great advantage is that this folder specifically with a .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file can be set . ( look at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems , files have a hide -@@ attri@@ bute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems , a specified score marks a file as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files are shown in the elementary tree or not . this option is switched on in default .
with links to files : when the option is de@@ activated , symbolic link@@ ages are compared . if the option is switched , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is disabled in default .
in links to folder : when the option is de@@ activated , the links are switched as normal folders and recur@@ sively under@@ go possible . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not on possible recur@@ rent . a link to a folder that would lead to yourself to a end loop and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; cr@@ ashes . ) This option is de@@ activated in default .
exec@@ uting a complete analysis of each file and displays the statistics columns . ( the number of deleted , un@@ mon@@ ast@@ eries , non@@ - white and white conflicts . ) The full analysis is s@@ lower than a simple binding analysis , and considerably s@@ lower when they are applied to files which will not contain text . ( give a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare a large folder about a long @-@ shaped network , it may be faster to compare only the amend@@ ment date and file size . however , this speed advantage does not cost you some degree of security . please be sure to check with caution . this option is out@@ dated in default .
similar to TR@@ US@@ UE the amend@@ ment date . there is no real comparison instead of . the files are identical as the same if they are identical . for example , it can be useful when copying the date of lost . please be treated with caution . this option is out@@ dated in default .
activ@@ ates the synchroni@@ ze mode when two folders are compared and no target folder specified . in this mode , the proposals for mer@@ ging are selected as selected . also the results of the mer@@ ging of files are stored in both folders . this option is de@@ activated in default .
if there are differences , instead of the inter@@ rup@@ ting the newer file is suggested as action . ( this is considered un@@ certain , because it &apos;s knowledge that the other file was not also changed . you should consider this in any case . ) This option is de@@ activated in default .
if a file or folder will be replaced by another or deleted , then the original version will be ren@@ amed with the .@@ ori@@ g extension . if an old backup file with the .@@ ori@@ g extension is already deleted . this also applies to the normal con@@ co@@ existence of single files , not only the mer@@ ging of single files . this option is turned into default .
normally the folder @-@ merge @-@ view stays visible with the assem@@ bling of individual files ; you can move the window with the mouse . if you do not want , you can switch the option directory &amp; Text@@ window sharing the main window in the window @-@ menu and switch off on the change between directory &amp; texture between the two views .
probably you prefer to compare a file using double @-@ clicking . however , there are also a corresponding menu entry . you can also install a single file with directly from the merge menu . if you save the result , the status will be completed and the file will not be mer@@ ged again if you launch the folder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , this status will be lost if you re@@ read the directory again : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; menu : new &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; menu : new &quot; &quot; &quot;
KDE supports network transparent with the help of KI@@ O slaves . K@@ Diff@@ 3 uses this for reading files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders for opening that are located on local or remote computers .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one to a FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a com@@ pressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax than local files and folders . a few things should you consider :
a path can be relative . or .. that is not possible with URLs not possible , these are always absolute .
special characters must be m@@ ask@@ eted . ( # - &gt; % 23 , spac@@ es@@ - &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the fil@@ es@@ ystem on the server , sometimes by the used protocol . there is a brief list of constraints :
or it can not be differenti@@ ated if a link is displayed on a file or folder . then , a file is accepted as a link @-@ destination . ( FTP : , s@@ ftp : ) .
there is no way to edit entit@@ l@@ ements or change date . therefore , the entit@@ l@@ ements or the change date from the original . ( note the option VER@@ TRA@@ UE of the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the main purpose is currently being differences @-@ viewer in K@@ DEV@@ EL@@ OP . K@@ DEV@@ EL@@ OP launches first always the built @-@ in differences . to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the differences @-@ viewer and then choose In K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ cover from the context menu .
usually required &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . if it is applied as K@@ Part , the input file is in the Uni@@ fied format . then adop@@ ts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the names of the original files from the patch file . then start &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file .
in the Kon@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu Pre@@ view in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work if any of the original files exists . moreover , this is un@@ reliable , when the original files have changed since the generation of the patch .
when it is executed when part is executed , it only supports the compar@@ ing of two files , a very small toolbar and menu . the mer@@ ging or the balance of folders will not be supported in the K@@ Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now He@@ ist es Komp@@ are ) there are already . moreover , the name K@@ Diff@@ user already pointed out that it can lead together as the program diff@@ use 3 from the di@@ ff @-@ tool collection .
I already use GPL programs very long and have learned a lot by going into the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone this path or going to go so .
you have compiled the program from the sources and the configure script probably will not be the correct pre@@ fix to KDE . in the default , KDE can not find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ ui@@ .@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ ADM@@ E file you will find further information on this subject .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are usually treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white sign is different , the line is treated as not the same . if similar lines are , next to each other , this is not coinci@@ dence but this does not take advantage of the case .
the editor opens for any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . however , this important information is lost , however , when the result is simply saved as text file , and it is too much effort to design a separate file format that could store this information .
the effort for this was too big . you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . to process larger quantities of text should be used by another editor .
after removing text is suddenly lt ; no src lin@@ s ; appeared and the text cannot be deleted . what does that mean and how can this be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; used already many colors to lift out differences . even more flo@@ ating would be conf@@ using and l@@ acks the purpose . use this for an alternative editor .
lots of good ideas and bug@@ reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ ine@@ 3 ; use &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or newer .
you can use information about how you can use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage .
a list of the latest modifications can be found under http : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ s@@ our@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in Qu@@ ell package .
to compile and install &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; please compile and install , use the following command in the basic folder of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; distribution :
KDE @-@ dir gives the folder in your system to install in KDE . if you are uns@@ ure , you will find further details in the RE@@ ADM@@ E file .
since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ make use , you should not have any problems with comp@@ iling . should nevertheless difficulties occur , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists thereof .
cutting ( Str@@ g @-@ X or Shift Del@@ ete ) copies to the cli@@ p@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( Str@@ g @-@ V or Shift ) adds the text from the cli@@ p@@ board to the current cursor position and re@@ places the current mark@@ ings .
only differences are displayed : files which are identical in all folders will not appear in the folder structure , and consequently not in the target folder .
( in the current program version , you need to re@@ read the folder to these options to the folder with the function Update . )
there are only entries displayed , the differences do not show that identi@@ ties will not already be copied into the target folder . if the target folder does not already contain , they are lacking in a later program version , This option is de@@ activated in default version .
note the buttons to choose the source with the label A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines are attached from the corresponding window to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if the lines are already present ) , they will be removed by clicking on the button .
in default , this option is disabled . under@@ rail in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white signs .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; displays a mini @-@ show of all virtual work areas . it is quite handy to see the running programs on the field surfaces , to change its size , to end it or post@@ p@@ one it . this works both within a working area and for several .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual work areas as well as those on running applications . these applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others .
with the middle mouse button you can move windows within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both within a working area and other labour areas .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked on : if on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; then click on an application inside &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; then clicking on an application inside &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; then click the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries to maxim@@ ize , On desktop and end . the commands effect the following :
maxim@@ ize the application window to the full size of desktop . appears only if it was cli@@ cked on an application .
send the application to the selected virtual desktop . appears only when I cli@@ cked on an application .
if this p@@ addle is marked , windows can be moved inside &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; s can be moved with the middle mouse button on your desktop and also to other work@@ spaces .
if this field is ti@@ cked , are displayed in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the names of virtual work areas are displayed .
App@@ et@@ ches this field leaves the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; display the numbers in virtual work areas . is it together with name ads , the names are provided with ordin@@ ances , &amp; eg ; 1st working space .
if this field is ti@@ cked , the background of each desktop is also shown as the background in the &amp; k@@ est@@ amp ;
when this field is crossed , the running programs will be displayed as a small window at the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise , only the empty squares are displayed in order to enable their selection .
here , the view from the program window is selected . simply shows simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the propor@@ tions of the program window . symbol shows a small view of the real program model . re@@ mark : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here you can specify the arrangement of the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; -@@ main window ; in a 2x@@ n @-@ rat , like out of P@@ ager applications in some other Win@@ dow@@ ns ; wa@@ agre@@ es shows all virtual work areas in a horizontal and vertical in a vertical row , which is very good for the presentation on the work@@ space .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to P@@ ager Mini@@ Program in the check line . he has the advantage that it can be displayed in size , the windows as symbols or with their content and move it . besides , it runs out of the control panel .
click the right mouse button inside &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; and follow @-@ up excer@@ pts of switch@@ able switch ... lets the dialog appear .
at the moment the dialog can not be changed in the dialog Settings menu , but you can manually do it manually :
Open the $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or VI@@ . if you don &apos;t have any writing for the file , you must register as a user root or write to your system administrator . in this file you must register the key win@@ dow@@ ns mode and value possible values :
da &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; part of the package base is , you need a functioning installation of KDE packages .

&amp; k@@ likes ; is a screen@@ shot ; you can use with &amp; k@@ mag ; a part of the screen . this application is interesting for different users . this includes artists , Web @-@ designer and people with a visual h@@ amp@@ ment . this documentation is meant to be a full manual for the use of &amp; k@@ likes .
&amp; k@@ mag ; is a powerful application that is constantly being extended by new functions . it is optimized for use on high @-@ performance machines .
when you start and start ; start a window as shown above . showing the enlarged area of the screen . below , this window shows a larger window .. The image that is displayed in mag@@ ni@@ fying window is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as a file window below .
in the default path enlar@@ ges &amp; k@@ mag ; the area around the mouse @-@ cursor is like a mobile mag@@ ni@@ fier . alternatively , you can indu@@ ce a selected screen area in mag@@ ni@@ fier ( selection mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse cursor on the screen .
do you want to avoid the cursor in the enlarged window , select the mouse cursor . please note that the mouse cursor is not yet able to recognize the form of the mouse cursor . this is always the standard k@@ not@@ ation ; / Q@@ t ; mouse cursor .
in the selection mode , you can adjust the selection window to your needs . you can move it with the arrow keys and mouth @-@ keys and change its size . this can be done in the following ways :
move the mouse cursor in the larger window and keep the left mouse button pressed , so you can move the content of the mag@@ ni@@ fier and move it . this also goes with the arrow keys .
if you are in addition the &amp; Shift ; taste or die &amp; M@@ MB ; use , you can move the file window .
with this combination you can change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the Cho@@ ose window will remain firm and only the lower right corner to move .
&amp; k@@ mag ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer , to copy into a file ( to insert it later into other applications ) , the image rot@@ ate and much more .
starts or stopping the update of the display . the p@@ opp@@ en update brings about the required CPU time against 0 .
select the Update rate ( Very low , bar@@ ing , means , Ho@@ ch , Very High ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is required .
in this mode a file window appears . the selected range is displayed in a window .
&amp; k@@ mag ; uses automatically your typ@@ ed short @-@ made files to store files , opening a new window , Dru@@ cken , new@@ com@@ er ( with the kno@@ b document again in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ lar@@ gement and cr@@ ushing &amp; etc .
k@@ ingly may also be known as &amp; k@@ mag@@ ni@@ fier ; is a screen@@ shot ; you can use a section of the screen so as if you use a mag@@ ni@@ fier to print the printed print in a newspaper or a photo . this application is for different people of benefits : from research che@@ ur or artist to the Web designer or ch@@ atting .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse @-@ click , as soon as the mouse @-@ cursor is a while at the same point . it is intended to help people suffering from the R@@ SI syndrome ( replic@@ as syndrome ) and those of each mouse @-@ click p@@ ains .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse @-@ click , as soon as the mouse @-@ cursor is a while at the same point . it &apos;s thought to help people who work at the Rep@@ eti@@ tive Stra@@ ight In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and those of each mouse click p@@ ulation . however , this may require a bit of exercise .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool : can handle the pain that arises in the click of the mouse and helps so many people to interact with the computer without pain . unfortunately , you may also prevent pain , which are related to the use of your computer , you should ask a doctor if this has not yet been done .
to make it even clear : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pain can avoid that are caused by clicking with the mouse , it is against pain , which is used by the mouse because of the mouse are us@@ eless . and as with all the ergonomic remedies : the result may vary for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitor your mouse movements and introduces a mouse click if you break down the movement shortly .
if the intelligent p@@ anning is enabled , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a rest after it is em@@ ulated the mouse button , it is waiting until the end of the motion , before the slogan leave the mouse button . in this way you can run the drag@@ ging mouse button . in this way you can move the drag@@ ging mouse button , but you get used quickly on it .
this extrac@@ ell@@ ation must be hidden after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse @-@ click leads .
is intelligent ren@@ ders turned on , the turning field is turned into ( 1 / 10 s ) active . here , the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after the button press the mouse button wait before it is left the mouse again if there is no evidence of the mouse .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports the click through mouse shi@@ fting . this function is now activ@@ ating a long scroll . these movements are stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ kes .txt for the first time , they can be changed later .
when the sound is del@@ ayed , you can shor@@ ten the reaction times , then go on sound &amp; multimedia , choose sound system and here the rider General . there is a sli@@ der sound @-@ buffer to shor@@ ten the reply to the propor@@ tions .
if this setting marks , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool : start with each start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only under &amp; k@@ de ; available at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please refer to the respective documentation to figur@@ ing out how to automatically launch a program there .
sets all settings back to values that have been submitted to the opening of dialogue . have already pushed the button in the button , the settings will apply to the status of the last gaps .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the pres@@ etting . in particular the intelligent ren@@ unci@@ ation should you first be postpon@@ ed . if you have to be used to the automatic mouse click , you can later make the smart p@@ anning .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it may be necessary to reduce the propor@@ tions of &amp; k@@ de ; at sound @-@ sounds .
first , you should be aware of what places a mouse @-@ click without effect stays : the clicking on the neutral ingredients of windows or on places in the browser window that does not constitute a link , does not cause un@@ loaded reactions . you can therefore use the mouse at such places until you want to use them again .
when your mouse ru@@ sted , you should clean your mouse . it &apos;s usually pretty easy . the trick is that you can not only clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come with the mouse ball in touch .
first , you have to take out the h@@ emisph@@ ere . as this happens , your mouse is different from mouse to mouse . however , it should be quick to see if you see the under@@ side of the mouse .
if you have the ball away , you need to see the ball . these are located on the sides of the ches , into which the ball was used . the dirt and the so@@ iling can easily merge with a flat blade or the he@@ ap @-@ cats .
in very rare situations the operating system rup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; when just a shooting range was started . if you in this case the smart exp@@ ul@@ sion means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool means that the surgery can no longer end up with the det@@ ach@@ ment of the mouse .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use other window manager and move a window .
the solution to this problem is that you can execute a mouse click . this is the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; return and you can continue to work as usual .
problem : when you enter text tries to execute &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to run mouse clicks and re@@ moves the cursor to another place .
solution : use the mouse to place the cursor to place where you want to have it . but you can no longer run the mouse on a neutral area of desktop . so there can be a different mouse click p@@ onder@@ ing . sure zones for the mouse @-@ cursor are un@@ loaded . secure zones for the mouse @-@ cursor are &amp; eg ; the gray areas for the toolbar and menus and the cover lines of windows .
I try to work with the intelligent ren@@ dering but I don &apos;t get it to edit text .
the intelligent p@@ one is an advanced feature of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you may mark it in the cli@@ p@@ board , to copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board or to re @-@ insert any other action , when you want to move the mouse to pressed mouse button . here are some advice on it :
use the smart slide not only if you just start using &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; select text instead the following : execute the mouse button pressed , while you move the mouse cursor to the other end of the text and enter the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . thus , each mouse button pressed , when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button supp@@ resses a sound like a mouse click . so you can use the smart p@@ anning also without the audi@@ ble mouse click . but this requires some practice .
to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use the X@@ test extension for &amp; X Window ; that should be on most system already the case .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available if the system has a sound@@ card and speaker and that is correctly arranged .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pressing the mouse as soon as the mouse @-@ cursor is short @-@ har@@ ness . this program was developed for people who suffer from the R@@ SI syndrome and those who are preparing the praying of the mouth .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool : can also be configured so that a certain time is waiting for a Go@@ ing process begins before the mouse button will start . in this way can also run the to@@ es and drop it with the mouse .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program that allows the user to speak their computer for themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; can let users select the computer for itself . the user can choose from a list with the talk of propositions which should be discussed again .
on the first page of the wiz@@ ard ( lin@@ kes screen@@ shot ) enter the command , which is later used for voice output . further details can be found in the description of the initial dial@@ ogs .
on the second page you choose the default box book . from the text files you can often use the text files without having to tap . the text pass@@ ts can naturally be edited .
on the third page ( legal screen@@ shot ) you determine the dictionary for the Wor@@ tery . &amp; K@@ mouth ; reads the text documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of each word . in addition , you can see the word list with a Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and essentially contains an input field for the key@@ note of your sets ( the lower white box in the screen@@ shot ) and a drop @-@ memory of the already spoken phr@@ ases ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
if you have calibr@@ ated , you can enter into the input field the propositions you want to hear . each sc@@ ann@@ ed set will be app@@ ended at the opposite memory . you can select phr@@ ases which should be discussed again .
with the menu @-@ entry settings k@@ mouth ; setup ... Open the dialog from &amp; K@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two cards , voice @-@ hand@@ over and settings , the page Wor@@ ter@@ restrial and the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service .
in the input field of cart@@ on map , give the command to the call of voice @-@ generator . in the field below the input field , you specify the string sets that the text will be handed over to the language generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; does not know two types to pass on the text . select the belt area , if the text is to be distributed as default hand@@ over to the language generator .
if the p@@ addle field is not selected , the text is shared as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholder :
of course , the command for voice output depends on your voice . this command can be found in the documentation on your language generator . examples for this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x .
with as much as a language service , the text is to use as a language service . if that is successful , the further settings will be available on this site . the kt@@ ori@@ de @-@ language service is a standardi@@ zed interface for voice output and which is currently being developed in SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the initial listing action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action by the short@@ cut or by choosing a text passage in the menu text pass@@ agen@@ book or in the bar for text pass@@ ag@@ books .
with the selection of so@@ fort , the chosen text passage directly pronoun@@ ced and additionally added to the box @-@ memory . with the selection of In the input field , the chosen text passage is first entered into the input field .
with the second selection field Writ@@ ing the editing program for text pass@@ agen@@ book , you can specify if the text@@ book book will be automatically stored in the editing of the processing system .
when selecting the text pass@@ word@@ book , the book will be saved . if you choose changes , the text pass@@ word@@ book will not be saved . dial on saving , will &amp; c@@ mouth ; ques@@ tioning whether the text@@ book will be saved .
the page Wor@@ ter@@ restrial contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the Wor@@ ds . in the main window next to the input field displays &amp; K@@ mouth ; a selection field occurs when this list contains more than a dictionary . with this selection , you can select the currently used dictionary for Wor@@ ds .
with buttons on the right side you can delete dic@@ tion@@ aries or add , order the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list you can set the name in the entry field name and in the selection field the language for the dictionary .
select for this source the desired language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then reads the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation is shown . in addition , you can compare the word list with a Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary . in addition , you can compare the word list with a Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary in order to only insert the word written words into the new dictionary .
with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; c@@ mouth ; queries then , which dic@@ tion@@ aries are assembled , and how this can be weigh@@ ted .
with this option you place a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly built words automatically adds into the dictionary , create you in the course of time a dictionary with your voc@@ abulary .
the main area of the window for processing text pass@@ ag@@ ets is tw@@ o@@ fold . in the upper part the texture books are represented as tree @-@ structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected record . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the associated keyboard , you can only change its name .
actions like add new text files or books or delete selected text passages and books , either via the selection in the menu bar , in the toolbar or over a drop @-@ down menu .
the order of text pass@@ ag@@ ets or text passages , you can change by drag@@ ging with the mouse to the new place or by the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; button .
the chosen text is cut off and copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field text is selected , this is used , otherwise the selected areas of the or@@ tho@@ ff .
the chosen text is copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field text is selected , this is used , otherwise the selected areas of the or@@ tho@@ ff .
the currently active sentence is spoken . if text is in the field of input , this is used , otherwise the selected phr@@ ases of the or@@ tho@@ ff .
is this menu entry fixed , a ext@@ end@@ able toolbar is displayed by buttons for frequently used commands . by mouse @-@ clicking on the tigh@@ ten left side and c@@ ess@@ ation , the toolbar panel can be moved to a different point .
if this menu entry has been clo@@ cked , a narrow gauge is shown in the lower part of the main window with instructions on the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed when not crossed , this status bar is hidden .

to show an example of the Command Line for setting up the language version , it is assumed that Free@@ TTS is installed in the folder / usr / local / fre@@ et . the language version is then possible with one of the three following command examples :
for the third example the option should send data as a default delivery . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ TTS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it conver@@ ts a list of ph@@ on@@ emen in a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , therefore you need an additional program to make the text on ph@@ on@@ eme . the license allows you to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text into ph@@ on@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA , under the acceptance that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / mb@@ ro@@ la .
unfortunately H@@ adi@@ fax likes the last character of the text so that an additional sign must be added . the full command is therefore more costly than in the other examples :
( Cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BAR _ / usr / local / mb@@ ro@@ la / de@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BAR _ / usr / local / mb@@ ro@@ la / dev / t@@ m@@ p.@@ wa@@ v ; art@@ spl@@ ay / tmp / t@@ m@@ p.@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ m@@ p.@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the instruction must be written into one line . the option data as default input must be enabled .
the voice @-@ D@@ äm@@ on von &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; further language service to provide all &amp; k@@ de ; K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being further developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various voice @-@ hand@@ over systems .
because the adjustment of voice @-@ generator is done only in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you just need to use as a language service as a language service .
for setting the page K@@ TT@@ SD language , which appears in the Settings dialog by &amp; K@@ mouth ; when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; successful to use , you need a language generator ( and natural &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; needs about 15 MB memory ( and additionally storage for the language generator ) , but in detail depends on your computer and its configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application with the people who can not speak , can be missed text by calcul@@ ator . there is a list of already stored phr@@ ases which the user can switch again again and again .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no voice syn@@ thesizer involves . on the computer you have to install a syn@@ thesizer .

when first start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr or as long as no spok@@ es@@ person , the map map will be displayed . see also . if you have set up at least one speaker , the map map will be shown . see .
most TTS @-@ syn@@ thesizer offer different languages and voices , so also various mascul@@ ine or feminine , or such that refers to volume or speed . you can also set several variations for a syn@@ thesizer . you should also set up multiple variants for a syn@@ thesizer . you should have at least one speaker set before you &amp; kt@@ on ; use , since the program speed @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher is otherwise used to the standard .
different speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable with multiple printing demands long for the same printer .
if you click on the cart@@ on @-@ card speaker in kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr , the map card speakers will appear . this appears automatically when you start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and not yet be set up .
all already furnished speakers appear in this list . the prefer@@ ed speakers appear above in the list . the top speaker is used for voice output when an application does not provide a speaker .
click with one mouse @-@ click a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
click with one mouse @-@ click a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
with one mouse @-@ click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to push the speaker in the list a line further down . the order of the speaker in the list determines its priority .
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the ongoing &amp; kt@@ on ; -@@ System .
choose a voting type here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a Jun@@ gen@@ - and maid for voice .
if you click here , appears on the new spok@@ es@@ man on the map map speaker . to change the settings of this microphone , click Edit .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ on ; already almost use . go back to map map General and check if voice service has been indicated ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , so that the TTS @-@ Service GmbH starts . please click on the map @-@ card orders to create and manage text orders .
if you have set up at least one speaker , you can start the language @-@ out system from &amp; k@@ de ; click on the map cart@@ on file to open this map map . here you can set some general options .
highlight this cli@@ pping field in order to activate the box ; this starts the box @-@ TTS @-@ Service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . this starting line will be displayed , and you can make text messages and read reviews . see the mark@@ er , K@@ TT@@ SD will be hal@@ ted and the TTS @-@ System of &amp; k@@ de ; disabled .
if kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr ends , runs and kt@@ on ; further , provided that the field voice is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
if this tick @-@ box marks and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr appears in the system area of the control panel , it appears once again , once the reading is complete .
with the buttons in this series you can start text records , break down and resume .
with buttons in this series you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; cli@@ p@@ board can be read or open a text @-@ file to read . you can also change the speaker for a job .
click on the OK button , then all changed settings on all pages will be adopted .
the card @-@ card orders is only shown when K@@ TT@@ SD started to start . to launch K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the box named K@@ TT@@ SD , click here ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed web page . check first , if &amp; kt@@ on ; ) . then select the text , which should be read , and select in the main menu tool text reading . after a short time the voice should begin .
it &apos;s almost always useful to mark the desired text of a web page . you can also ski@@ p this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; -@@ Pre@@ st@@ les and other invisible brands are also read .
in &amp; Kate ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; you can read the text displayed . check first , if &amp; kt@@ on ; ) . then select the text , which should be read , and select in the main menu tool text reading . then , the voice should begin .

filter for drawing up is a good opportunity to correct in &amp; kt@@ own ; it is a good example . you remove the tags br and b from the news , the K@@ mail sends , and also the expression / local / In@@ box , since this in most cases can be accepted as being provided .
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ own ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ on ; are filters not required .
in fil@@ tern , text is processed , before he will be sent to the Spe@@ ech disp@@ at@@ cher . you are useful for improving the pron@@ unci@@ ation to be false predic@@ ted words or abbrevi@@ ations , to select a suitable language and speaker or to avoid certain defici@@ encies of language syn@@ thesi@@ zers and their voices .
to understand the working methods of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; Spe@@ ech disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; with a text works . &amp; kt@@ on ; diff@@ ers four kinds of texts .
the output from Screen Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it will be pre@@ drawn to all the other supplements and holds these orders . if the output of the screen reader is pre@@ viewed , the orders are repeated .
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important news such as &amp; eg ; Proc@@ essor will be too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are continued after the warning of warning .
News have the next level priority . a message rup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that can be used . whilst you &amp; eg ; a long text on a website can be read , you can see with &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone who just enter the room . &amp; k@@ de ; noti@@ fications are also news . read about this .
the rest are simple text messages . each order you encounter from the cart@@ on is a text order . K@@ Say@@ it is an example of an application that uses text orders . text messages are meant for the output prolon@@ ged lyrics , which have no special ur@@ gency .
all four order types are processed in qu@@ eue , with the exception of the output of Screen Re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a screen header , while &amp; kt@@ on ; just such a reads , this issue is hal@@ ted and termin@@ ated .
first , you have to know that filters will never be applied to the output of Screen Re@@ aders . you will be applied to regular war@@ nings , messages and text messages as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages .
filter edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . at the moment there are three types of filters .
filters are executed as modules . in the future there can be further types of filters .
string files re@@ placing parts of a text by other text . the related parts can either give you either as words or as regular expres@@ sions . &amp; kt@@ on ; used by text or for reform@@ atting of messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; to be in a better compreh@@ en@@ sible form .
&amp; XML ; -@@ transform@@ ers use a X@@ SLT @-@ File ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format to another format . included in the delivery of &amp; XHTML ; are contained in SS@@ ML .
with speaker book@@ case you can send orders depending on the content of the text or on the program , which has sent the text on &amp; kt@@ on ; if you have set the text on the map map for feminine voice , you can read text from KDE messages about it . Si@@ eh@@ e can be read about it .
each of these different filters are adjustable to which he is applied to a voice version . if the filter does not agree , he will not pass the text unchanged to the next filter .
when a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; c@@ de ; sent , it is processed by all the activated filters supplied on the page below . the filter is processed in order in the list from top to bottom .
this displays the list of the furnished normal filters . is a filter not ti@@ cked , it is not activated and is not used . filter will be processed as a row from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and the further below are displayed below .
for setting up string files , you must enter a list of words or regular expres@@ sions as compar@@ isons , then the text is exchanged in the text , then the text is exchanged for the corresponding spare text .
enter a name for your filter . this name can be chosen arbitr@@ arily , it only needs to be different from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expres@@ sions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the character set in column and re@@ places it in accordance with the string from the column set . the list is shown in the sequence shown from top to bottom .
click here to post@@ p@@ one the selected word or the regular expression in the list .
with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expres@@ sions from a file that can store or delete the current list . download a list from file , the entries are attached to the existing list .
here is a language registered , the filter is only applied if the speaker is responsible for the text order one of the languages listed here . click on the button to display a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages when click on the mouse click the &amp; C@@ trl .
if a value is entered here , the filter is used only if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by comm@@ as , example : con@@ vers@@ ation , k@@ mail
the application @-@ ID program will receive you with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; D@@ bus ; numbers you have to let go . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application @-@ ID Kop@@ ete @-@ 34@@ 32 shows , you may only enter a copy .
the filter installation filter is used only then applied to the text when all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ eses to match . all input fields are empty , the filter will be applied to all text .
in comparison of words , the character output is used regular expression in the form \ \ s word \ \ . the words must therefore be limited by separ@@ ator ( blank ) .
in this guide you will find no guidance for writing regular expres@@ sions . if you have the &amp; k@@ de ; for &amp; # 160 ; reg@@ im@@ prints , you can call it in the di@@ alogues . -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; reg@@ im@@ prints can be found in the package of ambig@@ ti@@ ls .
&amp; XML ; -@@ transform@@ ers translate &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SLT files from a format in a different format . x@@ sl@@ t ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W3@@ C standard for such conver@@ sions . it can only be applied to well @-@ shaped XML . the support program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c must be installed on your system .
enter the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is reachable via the environmental variable PAT@@ H even x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
with the spok@@ es@@ woman filter , you can send text to a particular speaker , which is set up on the map map , or to a speaker with certain properties . you can for example , that texts by k@@ mail from a female voice should be read . see .
before &amp; kt@@ on ; a text handed over to the filter , there is a speaker for the text . the speaker is chosen according to the speaker properties , which the program pre@@ viewed , and selected the properties of the speaker speaker speaker . with the speaker @-@ op@@ tionally available you can over@@ write the selected speakers .
here is a value recorded , the filter is applied in case the text contains the given regular expression . is installed on your system of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; reg@@ im@@ prints , you can call it by clicking on the button to get help with input .
to achieve a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , d. h. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
Set here the properties of the desired fil@@ tering . if the text selected the above filter conditions , the speaker is selected , which corresponds to the desired requirements . click on the button on the right to indicate the dialog boxes .
use these buttons to save or load your spok@@ es@@ person or to delete all settings .
the spok@@ es@@ woman filter is applied only to the text when all conditions apply to an entry in the box Di@@ eses . if you need to apply at least a condition .
the language hand@@ over API , by &amp; k@@ de ; with which programmers can give their applications TTS @-@ skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD over &amp; D@@ bus ;
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API when syn@@ thesizer to K@@ TT@@ SD will be added , so that syn@@ thesizer can use syn@@ thesizer .
the following section contains a brief description of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ bus ; interface of the voice output API of &amp; k@@ de ; . the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the k@@ de ; Acc@@ essibility Website ( http : / / acc@@ essi@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications require voice output services via the &amp; D@@ bus ; interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from the kt@@ ts@@ d via the object K@@ sp@@ ech .
adding text to the text and option a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc .
there are even more commands you can use . for a list of all orders you enter
Open two &amp; console ; -@@ window . start only in one window , then kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr in the other .
none of the mentioned language syn@@ thesizer supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have set the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ transform@@ ers filter , but when using the module for festival , websites are not read .
due to an error in the Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you have to install the ( male UK ) voice of Rab _ di@@ phone so you do not need to do so if you do not use this voice to read web pages . make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and about the environmental variable PAT@@ H .
certain signs or pun@@ ctu@@ ation characters appear to cause mistakes with syn@@ thesizer , so that whole sent@@ ences are over@@ clo@@ aked or only Kau@@ der@@ wel@@ d . what can I do against it ?
first ensure that the option tab is set to the correct value for the appropriate language . are there problems with certain signs or words , these may possibly be fixed by a string resource filter . see .

K@@ TTS is working with each language syn@@ thesizer , which can be started at the command line in a &amp; con@@ sole ;
the list of the above mentioned languages can be incomplete or dep@@ rec@@ ated . therefore , consider the description of syn@@ thesizer to the supported languages . look also on the website of kt@@ own ; to provide information that are not yet contained in this manual .
the program &quot; Spe@@ ech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; uses a adap@@ table module @-@ designed module for voice syn@@ thesizer . if you want to expand &amp; kt@@ on ; for the use of another syn@@ thesi@@ zers , please contact the team team .
the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; it is not mandatory . Debian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command ap@@ t @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
to compile and compile , you need a current development environment of KDE ( version 3.4 or later ) including the del@@ e@@ tion files and the source files for the program &quot; Spe@@ ech disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot;
if you have downloaded the source code of &amp; kt@@ , from the source archives , or downloaded the tar@@ ball available for each night and install the program with the following commands :
before you use &amp; kt@@ on ; use first , check if Spe@@ ech disp@@ at@@ cher works properly with your voice syn@@ thesizer . this allows you to use the Sh@@ ell@@ ency SPD @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ on ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ on ; the program is sp@@ ill @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr is to be developed as further developed that the establishment of sp@@ ess@@ ech disp@@ at@@ cher is not possible and the script for SPD no longer is needed .
a long text is dis@@ loc@@ ates in individual sets . the user can re@@ boot or repeat the output , repeat the output or break down .
if an application is posted on &amp; kt@@ on ; for example , it can request the properties of the preferred intercom for the issue . so if you have set an speaker , whose language English and whose gender is feminine will be chosen , otherwise the best suitable speaker is chosen . if you want to know more about how &amp; kt@@ on ; a speaker is chosen , see you in .
if you click on the map map speaker to add an speaker in the list or click Edit , the map map Spe@@ aker is displayed . as an example , the module for module is shown for Festival Interactive . details of the modules can be found under .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable f@@ estival@@ program . if the path to Festival in PAT@@ H is included , you just need to enter a festival .
select the string of text that is handed over to Festival . in votes , the &amp; kt@@ on ; well @-@ known , this setting will automatically be made . generally , that Western languages will use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , eastern languages like Czech or Slovak ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ ders you set volume , microphone speed and pitch @-@ height of the synthetic language . if you can not select some regul@@ ator and this grey , the voice can not be shown .
some voices like multi@@ Sy@@ n voices need to be loaded due to their size several seconds to be loaded , these voices will already be loaded at the launch of K@@ TT@@ SD so that ( with large storage of storage ) the first set will be syn@@ thesi@@ zed .
if this p@@ addle field cannot be selected , you have no speaker set up ( or forget to apply ) .
if this tick @-@ box is displayed , is displayed at the start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr the program window . otherwise , after starting only the symbol kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr in the system section is visible , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window .
if this tick @-@ box marks and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is not running , it appears in the system area , once K@@ TT@@ SD appears a text . thus , you have the possibility to read the pre@@ read or otherwise control it .
here all orders are listed in qu@@ eue , along with the application that set the job , the current status of the order , the number of propositions and the straight @-@ worked sentence . the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the map speaker speaker .
with buttons in this series you can use in order to proceed in the list below , pre@@ - or go back . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) .
by clicking on the OK button all changes of settings ( also on the other map cards ) and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is reduced to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window .
if the Sound@@ system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stream@@ er or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the map of map audio . see also .
here are only text messages listed and managed . Edition of Screen read@@ y@@ ers , war@@ nings and messages are not displayed . more information about the news types of &amp; kt@@ on ; can be found in .
select here the type of audio output . if a component can not be selected , has been compiled &amp; kt@@ on ; either without support for the corresponding audio module , compile or desktop , the necessary libraries cannot load .
if stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de should be used for audio output , select here the audio output . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you need to install at least one module , select the PC@@ M device . see also
Set the intercom speed here . 50@@ n@@ bsp ; % is equivalent to half the half and 200@@ n@@ bsp ; % about the double normal intercom speed . thus these settings can be implemented , the program must so@@ x be installed .
click to apply to the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ on ; system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are furnished in your system . most of them will not work . you will need to find out which device will work with you . in doubt you choose standard .
on this map , you can set special actions that will always be executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ on ; processes four types of language courses :
the output from Screen Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it will be pre@@ drawn to all the other orders and holds these orders . after the output of the screen reader has been read , the orders are recorded again .
war@@ nings have priority priority . this level is important news such as &amp; eg ; Proc@@ essor will be too hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are continued after reading the warning again .
News have the next priority . a message rup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application to read the news . if you &amp; eg ; just a long text on a website , you can see with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless , you can see someone who just enter the room .
will be interrupted by a message using a message , warning or the output of a screen charger , adds &amp; kt@@ on ; the audio output is in qu@@ eue .
this audio file is always played then , when a normal text is interrupted . if both intro@@ duc@@ tory sound as well as intro@@ duc@@ tory message is active , the intro@@ duc@@ tory sound is played before the intro@@ duc@@ tory message .
the settings on this map parameter only apply to normal proposals . for messages , war@@ nings , and the issues of Screen read@@ y@@ makers , there are no special promotions if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority .
to read with &amp; kt@@ on ; K@@ not@@ fy news , start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and click Agre@@ ements . the card card will be al@@ erts .
highlight this cli@@ pping field to switch the pre@@ read of &amp; k@@ de ; please note this setting is not marked , the other settings are disabled and &amp; kt@@ own ; no noti@@ fications before .
if this setting marks , noti@@ fications , in which a sound is played , by &amp; kt@@ on ; not read .
use these buttons to add events to list or delete it . if you click on the button Add , you will appear in which you want to use the application and event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the news before the &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation was sent when someone men@@ tions in a IR@@ C message to your nickname .
all events , for which in the list is nothing else stated , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ on ; ignored .
use this file field to specify what &amp; kt@@ on ; do when an event occurs . you have the following choices :
if you have selected the defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholder :
you can enter the properties of the desired spok@@ es@@ person . standard choose the speaker that is shown in the list on the map map speaker as the super@@ ster entry .
note that there are three levels for events . is defined for a certain event of a certain application an action , it will be executed . otherwise , the action is fixed for all other events of the particular application . as the last option , the action is fixed for carrying out under standard ( all other events ) .
the Event All noti@@ fications for application Standard ( all other events can not be deleted from the list . for this , you can specify the notification notification as follows :
use the button save to save the settings for al@@ erts to a file . use the button below to load stored settings from a file . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except all of them will be deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W3@@ C standard to select text for the control of voices , the volume , volume , sex , and audio levels . also marks for controlling the pron@@ unci@@ ation , for example abbrevi@@ ations . SS@@ ML is a part of the preference . SS@@ ML is a part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W3@@ C standard .
currently supported &amp; kt@@ on ; SS@@ ML can only partly and only in the basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you have to install the Rab _ di@@ phone voice ( bri@@ tish male ) because this is the default voice which the festival used in the output of SS@@ ML .
if the settings for speed or ton@@ ight in the Festival configuration dialog box does not set up to 100@@ n@@ bsp ; % , SS@@ ML text is usually very mon@@ ot@@ on .

there are two types of filters - normal filters and typ@@ es@@ lim@@ it@@ less filter ( SD@@ B @-@ filter ) . S@@ B@@ Ds sub@@ divided text in individual phr@@ ases . thus , you can also proceed to the map , not all the text order . in addition , you can also pre @-@ jump off or stop and break down even if the language syn@@ thesizer do not directly support this .
here you can see the proposition @-@ bound@@ less filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ on ; it is automatically set up as a pre@@ condition to add a scr@@ at@@ ching filter . you can change its settings or add more pro@@ posi@@ it@@ less filter , but we will be dis@@ ban@@ ded from it .
the easiest way to get to know the furn@@ aces selection by way of trying out . place on the map @-@ selection orders , which spok@@ es@@ man can be chosen . turn out some properties and check how to choose the selection of the microphone . in addition , you need to have set more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ on ; then fast with reading can begin , since only the first phrase needs to be processed and not the whole text block , which can take very long ,
you can then stop orders on the map , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer this function is not supported .
for these reasons the normal set @-@ bound@@ less filter is automatically set up if you start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be de@@ activated , just change anything at this filter , unless you know what you do .
S@@ atz@@ en@@ ges@@ tion filters compare text with a regular expression for s@@ atz@@ inger and add a tab ( dec@@ imal number 8 ) to the filter limits ( tab ) before fil@@ tering is automatically removed from the text ( tab ) . note that the default @-@ volume production system re@@ tains the character .
S@@ BD @-@ Filter will never be used on &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( k@@ re@@ re@@ ) , war@@ nings , messages or the output from Screen Re@@ aders .
if you have removed from verses the normal set @-@ bound@@ less filter , you can insert them again by loading the file standard _ sb@@ dr@@ c .
on the map @-@ card spre@@ ads , you can over@@ write the spok@@ es@@ person for the application . the map map will be shown when
use of the standard speak@@ ers ( the top on the map map speaker ) . in other words : there are no spok@@ es@@ person properties .
use of the most pass@@ able spok@@ es@@ man , who has not delete or edit the properties of a furnished speaker . if you choose the settings of the microphone , select &amp; kt@@ on ; this spok@@ es@@ person choose . otherwise , the spok@@ es@@ person , which corresponds to the most commonly agreed properties .
select the method to enter the desired spok@@ es@@ person by clicking on one of the buttons below .
choose the qualities of the desired microphone . if this feature does not play a role , you do not give anything .
highlight this check@@ box if the property has priority over other properties . you can also set several mark@@ ings here .
since the language is a critical factor in understanding the issue is , it will always be treated as a priority feature . the only case in which you might want to specify the attri@@ bute language is especially if you know that a certain application text is sent in a different language than that in the working environment .
to use all properties in the area of speaker , which corresponds to the short@@ est of the following , click on the selection below and then use on speaker , which corresponds to the short@@ est of the following .
in this case 0 is zero for the last text order in qu@@ eue . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number the input is required ) .
kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr cr@@ ashes immediately when it is started . I have compiled Deb@@ ug @-@ support , but I don &apos;t get any re@@ trac@@ eable .
G@@ Stream@@ er is cr@@ ashed and m@@ kt@@ on ; it was termin@@ ated . probably you have to register G@@ Stream@@ er 0.@@ 8.@@ x is the command G@@ ST @-@ register system 0.8 . if the problem is not solved , maybe a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stream@@ er is installed . you can try to update G@@ Stream@@ er or un@@ install .
the audio output via AL@@ SA does not work when I stop using another application music . if I stop a text order , free@@ ze &amp; kt@@ on ; one . on the &amp; console ; appears a message that says : take to open PC@@ M .
on your system , there is the problem that conflicts can occur during AL@@ SA that can prevent a simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . notes for possible solutions can be found on the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org .
I have downloaded an additional voice for Festival from the internet . I installed it and I can use them at the festival , but kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr indicates that voice .
add the new voice in the $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / f@@ estival@@ int / Vo@@ ices . as a guide you can use the other entries . if this is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; on which you found the voice to the developers .
on the map Audio there is a setting speed . so that this works , the program must so@@ x installed and be fo@@ ol@@ ish@@ able via the ambi@@ ent variable PAT@@ H . some Syn@@ thesizer mod@@ ulation like Festival Interactive offer yourself on the map parameter for speaker setting up an attitude towards speed . depending on the chosen voice this is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the microphone speed are ignored if &amp; kt@@ on ; &amp; HTML ; pre@@ reads . ( that is because the HTML has its own tags , with which the speed is controlled . ) De@@ activate either the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; according to &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are completely bra@@ ve , change the .x@@ sl file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ according to SS@@ ML O@@ E@@ ML , and insert the speed down .
I don &apos;t understand that websites with a female voice can be read before . I have set a female Festival Spe@@ aker , but &amp; kt@@ on ; reads the websites with a male voice .
at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the day s@@ able gender does not seem to work . with this festival , the X@@ SL file re@@ jects the X@@ SL file for converting SS@@ ML to S@@ aber @-@ tags . the same applies for the VO@@ ICE @-@ tags .
I have added a string resource filter , and now I can proceed in &amp; kt@@ on ; no more sales or go back . on the cart@@ on orders is shown , the order pun@@ ched only from a sentence . what am I doing wrong ?
pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks ( point , ro@@ dent sign , comm@@ its and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) may not be fil@@ tered . use for these characters instead a filter for the bound@@ ary detection .

Festival is one of the best free TTS @-@ syn@@ thesizer , whose source code is obvious . the quality of the votes is generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported . with many voices you may have volume , microphone speed and clay height with &amp; kt@@ on ; stop .
you must install at least one language . help you find in the instructions that are provided with festival . do you want to read web pages , you have to install the ( Male British ) voice of Rab ( di@@ phone ) .
for these voices you have to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on transmission .
this voice sets Festival 1.@@ 95 beta or later pre@@ di@@ ct . the vote is still in an early stage @-@ stage . un@@ pack the software in festival / lib / Vo@@ ices / Russian / . if you have Russian voices , you must enter for the voices ms@@ u _ ru _ n@@ sh _ di@@ phone . choose a k@@ yr@@ ill@@ ic ( 8 @-@ bit ) coding as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux ; distribution parti@@ tions . look at the festival as first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the coding option must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the coding option must be set to a 8 @-@ bit k@@ yr@@ ill@@ ic as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .

this hand@@ book explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; a module for the port interface , allowing the management of network interfaces , routine and DNS settings .
the &amp; ch@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be accessed through the selection of K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was developed to enable users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way , such as other settings from the &amp; K@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; the ranges from &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple surface for the following tasks :
after installation , a new module &quot; module will be displayed in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check@@ box &quot; &quot; &quot; ; &quot; module . the module &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting from k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network network settings in the &amp; k@@ menu ; can be started . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware is not installed and configured . physical devices and their drivers have to be functioning properly and configured to allow &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all indicates and allows setting of the network properties .
in most cases drivers for the network hardware and other devices are installed with installing &amp; Linux ; connected and set . will network devices added later , the driver must be loaded by adju@@ sting the following files , according to the kernel version , loaded :
&quot; &quot; &quot; the module &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; network settings will be loaded , when the option &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Network &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; option is selected in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; h@@ olog@@ l@@ center ; Index &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; when starting the module &apos;s network settings , this , the platform used on the system will automatically detect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the platform cannot be recognized , the hands @-@ p@@ age@@ able selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which the distribution and the rele@@ aser will be best . through mark@@ ers the Sett@@ ing No @-@ again query the setting can be taken permanently . at the next start of the network settings , this selection will automatically be pres@@ et .
the change of network settings is only possible in the system administration mode . previously , all options are displayed , what does the settings can only be seen . in the system administration mode you reach by clicking the button of system administration mode at the right bottom of the module . it is the input of the password required .
in the system design mode the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three hor@@ semen :
the rider network interfaces provides for the administration of the network devices of the system . all available net@@ devices are displayed . by the rider network interfaces , the following tasks can be carried out :
you can set the settings on the network interface through selecting the desired device in the list and click the button to set up the button in the dialog box .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the button Advanced settings shows the dialog with further options .
with the selection of automatic , the TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched by a DH@@ CP server or BOO@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP address is required for each system start . therefore , no further adjustment is required . in the selection list , either DH@@ CP or BOO@@ TP can be selected according to the system .
with the selection Manual you can set the TCP / IP configuration without DH@@ CP or BOO@@ TP . in the input field IP @-@ address you must set the desired TCP / IP address . in the input field network mask is set to specify the sub@@ networks .
if this setting marks , initi@@ alizes the system the network interface on the boats . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated .
the values in this dialog are displayed as characteristics of the device in the device list .
it should be assured that IP address in the network is not already used . entering an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . you can determine whether the desired address is already in use . in doubt the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or activated , depending on the required device . switching of a sign@@ alled network device is done by selecting from the list and click of interface ....
network devices can be activated or activated , depending on the need . dis@@ able an active network device takes place by selecting from the list and click of interface .
sets the IP @-@ address of the computer in the local sub@@ net , which con@@ veys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ marine networks .
when the computer is present more than one network interface , the interface must be selected on the net , in which the gateway @-@ computer is to be selected .
a PC with DNS support re@@ places a complete domain name by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only be understood IP addresses . if the computer is http / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS BE this name into an IP address such as 12@@ 3.4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the machine to the attri@@ bute of part of the rider folder allows an easy management of this list . entries can be added , removed or modified in the list with the buttons , or down@@ grade in the list with the buttons , or shut@@ down in the priority .
by clicking the but@@ ton@@ er ... from the group calcul@@ ator a DNS server can be added to a DNS server . it will be adding the new Nam@@ es@@ er@@ ver dialogue .
first , you must enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the button Add . the entry then will be inserted in the list .
from the group Calcul@@ ator to the name @-@ resolution , select an entry and then click the button Edit .... It will be shown to dialogue Be@@ am .
the list explicitly known computer describes the name @-@ to @-@ IP addresses for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used first and foremost on the bo@@ oting , if no DNS server are available . in small , closed networks , it can replace DNS servers .
usually , the list contains exactly known calcul@@ ators some entries , which support and ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses support . this still in the test run version of IP should replace in the future version 4 .
enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add .... The New Ali@@ as dialog displays .
enter the name of the known calcul@@ ator and click the Add button . if the known calcul@@ ator has several alias names , de button Add several times and enter the other alias .
select an entry of a nam@@ known calcul@@ ator from the list and select Edit .... The dialog to edit your computer is displayed .
it can be done one of the following tasks then by clicking OK , the list of static hosts will be updated .
the settings made in the Module Network settings are not effective in the system effective . to enable the changes , must be placed in a &amp; con@@ sole ; the following command will be reset .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is http : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ s@@ our@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for installation of bin@@ ary distribu@@ tions ( mostly rpm packages ) , it is enough when &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and installed in a &amp; con@@ sole ; with rpm like this :
alternatively , a tool can be used with graphic user interface such as the package or the installation tool of your distribution .
for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; not , but in addition , the development of development with libraries and other things are needed .
this is only recommended by experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should do this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology is given , on the second part discussed from &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; Modi@@ fied configuration files .
this area can not replace more knowledge about IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information on the inclusion of the PC is convey@@ ed into a small ( home ) network .
currently , IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found great spread . from IP@@ v@@ 6 , it is expected to continue in the near future . this description is currently based on the widespread IP@@ v@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is to assign which IP @-@ address of a network interface is . in alien networks , at &amp; eg ; workplace is the response point , which is a valid IP address or if available , can only be used as DH@@ CP . in any case , the IP address can not be chosen arbitr@@ ary .
when setting up a separate small ( home ) network , the IP address should be chosen especially for this purpose to avoid IP address conflict with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwarded to the Internet , therefore its arbitr@@ ary use is possible .
of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gat@@ ew@@ ays .
for smaller networks usually addresses in the field of 19@@ 2.@@ 168.@@ 1.1 up to 19@@ 2.@@ 168.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 calcul@@ ators .
additionally , the network mask is usually set on 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 so that all computers are on the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.@@ 0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the Second @-@ called Lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own machine ) . the default route is required for IP rout@@ ing .
the IP address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to an own so @-@ called Lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works as a closed circle .
in this section you will find the configuration files that are connected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; and where they are stored in different distribu@@ tions .
this file is sometimes dynam@@ ically changed for DSL connections , so that it is not surprising when in case of active DSL connections to a different content than h@@ ated there .
for &amp; S@@ use ; is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another stand than expected can therefore occur .

to change a variable , select first to modify the variable variable . go then to Edit ... Alternative for you to click the variable and edit ... select , or you press C@@ trl ; O .@@ It will then edit the dialog variables in which you can edit the variable .
to delete an ambi@@ ent variable , select first the variable . go then to Edit .
in order to enable an ambi@@ ent variable or de@@ activated them , select it and place the state with the menu item Edit activi@@ sts . in a de@@ activated vari@@ able appears under description de@@ activated .
alternatively , you can also select the right mouse button on the variable and select activ@@ ates . make sure that name and value of the variables are correctly displayed correctly .
when all tasks and environmental variables were added or changed , you still need to save the c@@ ron@@ tab . select the menu item File Save .
alternatively , you can press C@@ trl ; S . changes or additions to tasks or variables are then become active .
it appears the standard k@@ de ; printing dialog . if you choose , you can see that there are two extra &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; specific options in print dialog .
prints the c@@ ron@@ tab of all the users on the system . this option is only accessible to users who have extended per@@ missions .
cr@@ on , for example vi@@ x@@ ie @-@ cr@@ on . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses the command c@@ ron@@ tab to change the sched@@ ules of the users .
a PO@@ SI@@ X @-@ compliant &amp; UNIX ; for example with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard orders from &amp; UNIX ; to find time and date .
&amp; k@@ dat ; is a safe program for belt gri@@ ds on the basis of tar . it offers the possibility to create several archives on a tape . the first one consi@@ sted of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for fast , sel@@ ective un@@ pack . the second goal was to answer a question that asked my wife : how much longer does it take when you as@@ ures ?
before a tape can be used , it must be done by &amp; k@@ dat ; that can occur in three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; sp@@ ult the band back and reads the pre @-@ thr@@ illing information of the tape . recognize &amp; k@@ dat ; the predic@@ ted on the tape do not , you will be asked if the band should be form@@ atted .
det@@ ects &amp; k@@ dat ; the incident , it searches for the fitting index on your record . can this not be found , you will be asked if the Band@@ index will be newly created .
if everything went smoothly , the symbol changes for belt drive to indicate that the band was integrated . in the status bar a corresponding message appears . the content of the tape can now be sear@@ ched through out of the entry for the band .
in front of the withdrawal of the gang , first the integration must be solved . there are three methods in order to achieve this .
&amp; k@@ dat ; returns to the tape by changing the symbol for the tape , that the inclusion for the band was solved and displays a corresponding notification in the status bar . the band can now be changed without danger .
before a band can be used by &amp; k@@ dat ; it must be form@@ atted .
a band @-@ cards must be form@@ atted before you can be used to save data . this procedure does not advance the form@@ atting of its use , this must happen before you can form@@ atted a band before using &amp; k@@ dat ; form@@ atted . flo@@ ppy disks tend to be form@@ atted a form@@ atting of the case prec@@ eding , DAT @-@ drives , but not .
after entering the belt name and the capacity , &amp; k@@ dat ; with the form@@ atting of the gang . all the data on the tape are lost . after completion of the form@@ atting , the band is automatically integrated and ready to use .
before you encounter the backup process , you must select the files to be assured , that can occur in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . it is saved only this file or folder .
select a profile profile in the tree . only those files are stored in the profile .
select files in the local file tree with one tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folder will be backed up .
please click with the right mouse button on the local file tree and select in the menu bar .
once the backup has been introduced , the dialog opens up settings for backup . in this dialog you can even check the selected files and change the settings for backup .
if you have confirmed the settings , the dialog displays the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it is only checked the selected file or folder .
select files in one of the archives in the entry for the band with one tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be checked .
click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry .
once the test process was started , the dialog displays adjustments for check . in this dialog you can once again check your choice and change the working folder for the review .
if you have confirmed the settings for verification , the dialog displays the progress of the inspection process as well as the data through@@ put and the remaining time .
before you can initi@@ ate the re@@ produce , the files you need to be recovered . this can be made in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives , which belong to the entry for the belt drive . only the selected file or sub@@ folders will be recovered .
select the requested files from one of the archives with one tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be recovered .
click with the right mouse button on a file or folder in one of the archives and select menus ..
once the recovery process was started , the dialog displays settings for restoration . in this dialog you can once again check your choice and change the working folder for the restoration .
if you have confirmed the settings for restoration , the dialog displays the progress of the recovery process as well as the data through@@ put and the remaining time .
sometimes it proves to be necessary to create the band@@ index file using the band@@ content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can create the index on two types of the tape :
this allows a backup profile with the straight selected files and standard settings . you can carry out the following settings for a backup profile :
the current working folder in which the backup shall take place . the list of retri@@ eved files will be automatically updated according to the selected work folder .
for all folders specified under locking files , only those files are stored on the same fil@@ es@@ ystem , such as the folder . folders that are on other fil@@ es@@ ystem , you can enter separately under backup files . each entry is viewed from tar independent of the others .
perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used since the last incre@@ mental backup , only the files backed up since then changed .
the name of the file that is used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the snapshot file in front of the call of tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is set up for the next backup .
the functionality of buttons files &amp; gt ; and r@@ ushed ; files was not yet fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set the settings on the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the full path to the device file for belt drive ( normally / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ medi@@ ator version of the belt .
if this attitude is active , transm@@ its &amp; k@@ dat ; before the band is mounted the command line load on the drive . with some drives this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed .
is the option switched on , tries &amp; k@@ dat ; the acc@@ us@@ ation to block the belt drive . maybe this setting does not work at all corners .
if the option is switched on , while solving the integration of &amp; k@@ dat ; automatic the band un@@ mounted . use this option not on flo@@ ppy stre@@ aming .
is the option switched , trying to change &amp; k@@ dat ; the hard@@ full block size for belt drives . not all drives support variable block@@ cars . no matter if this attitude is active or not , you need to communicate &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the block size for your band@@ width .
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a band form@@ atted , write it to the beginning of the bank@@ note . this file should occupy only one memory block on the tape . the content of the file is composed as follows :
( N Byte ) The band @-@ ID . the format of this character string is ar : seconds , with invo@@ ke the full name of the system is , on which the volume has been form@@ atted . seconds is the number of seconds passed since the time has been form@@ atted .
the Band @-@ ID will be used to locate a file with the same name in the folder $ HOME / .@@ k@@ dat / .
the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archive , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as it is not a incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the content of a backup block . this symbol is only active if a band is involved .
&amp; ks@@ s.@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer for system prot@@ ocols . the program is for in@@ experienced users who can not know where you can obtain information about your system , or where the system uses different protocol files ; experienced users with quickly access to information about problems related to their server .
&amp; ks@@ s.@@ log ; helps users to understand what your computer is in the background . the task of co@@ operating system log ; is a simpli@@ fied representation of the protocol @-@ files of your own system . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who can not know where you can obtain information about your system or where the system sets the various protocol files .
in addition , &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; experienced users with quickly access to information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; therefore tries to provide some advanced features with which help the protocol @-@ files of certain programs can be fil@@ tered and evaluated .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 owns and work@@ s.@@ log ; a number of useful features . among other things include :
support for many different types of protocol files , for the format of the sy@@ s@@ log server and for Sam@@ ba
many other features are also included and are explained in the other chapters of this hand@@ book .
as you see in the following screen@@ shot displays &amp; ks@@ s.@@ log ; functions provided with their help the individual protocol lines of a protocol @-@ file is easily fil@@ tering and s@@ orting . the different options for s@@ orting and filters are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after starting the start @-@ system log ; first of all the main protocol @-@ file of the system - the system protocol . will not be displayed , and it opens up instead of its small news item , so you have a system container log ; so you have the log files under Linux usually in the folder / var / log , for the normal user usually do not have permission to read .
you can also use the fil@@ tering bar to filter after a selected criterion or a specified character set . in the default setting , the file list contains next to the filter the entry . then a protocol @-@ line will only be displayed when the columns are included in the filter set of the filter .
you can also select another entry at this point . select for example in the protocol @-@ file system protocol , then select the column process , and carry out the name of a process , so shows you &amp; ks@@ s.@@ log ; all protocol lines are sent or created by this process .
this option is activated in default settings and helps you see the important protocol lines . log @-@ lines of level error are shown with a distinctive color as a protocol @-@ lines of the level warning . the colored display of protocol lines can be converted into dialog .
just want to display certain process ( e.g. in the system protocol or in the C@@ ron @-@ protocol ) , so you can examine the process identification ( PID ) in the column process . this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a particular instruction such as the start of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case you use Filter@@ bar .
in addition , you can jump the option to add new lines in the context menu of the main window , in order to show all new added protocol lines .
&amp; ks@@ s.@@ log ; allows to use multiple protocol files in sep@@ er@@ ate sub@@ windows . to open this function , use the entries in the menu window to open additional window windows , select in the menu a protocol to display .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; has its own website to http : / / ks@@ s.@@ log@@ .@@ org@@ . D@@ ort you will find more information on the sources of sources of &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; .
&amp; ks@@ s.@@ log ; can also be found in the following folder of &amp; k@@ de ; Subversion archive : ks@@ s.@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ archive
welcome to the &amp; k@@ de ; System V in@@ it Editor , more known ( and in the following also as named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; . this section holds a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ;
the V in@@ it system develops rapidly to the standard for control of the program starts at the use of the system in the &amp; Linux ; and therefore because it is easier to use , powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD in@@ it .
I will not go further into historical aspects ( e.g. because I know nothing about it : - ) .
the in@@ it bin@@ ary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important , because maybe someone might try to recover a machine on System V in@@ it without having a re@@ install and reform@@ atting . therefore , you must see that the old in@@ it was removed from there if there was there one .
the Sy@@ s@@ V in@@ it also diff@@ ers from the BSD in@@ it that the configuration files in a sub@@ folder of / etc are instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ d. D@@ ort you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following other folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically you need a script for any system service to start the system or change to another Run@@ level . system services include such things like network , NFS , &amp; s@@ end@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things like set@@ serial that is run only once . such views belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should take part in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems do this file even if there is actually not much use for it . you can also run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to carry out something with the serial port .
the kernel looks for different places in the program in@@ it and starts the first that he finds .
the standard Run@@ level is in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line like the following :
at this point you can throw a look into the second column and probably will notice that the default level @-@ level 3 is . if you want to change it , then you can restore / etc / in@@ it@@ tab of hand and change the 3 . if you have something en@@ rolled , then you will repair your system rest@@ art and perform the following :
but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you ls -@@ l type in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there is no right files in this folder . instead , each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d .
how does and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is so written that it accepts an argument as start and stop . you can actually start this script from hand at the command line :
this would stop the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the one K includes , the script is called with the argument stop , the script is called with the argument .
some people would like to establish a simple way of working machinery for many reasons . I could &amp; eg ; a server Run@@ level , which can only htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . , I could also have a user -@@ Run@@ level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc ; starts .
here you learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult since the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or other po@@ inters is simple to not tri@@ vial , simply drag an entry in the area of the availability system services to one of the six round @-@ level to start it at this level ( or to stop ) .
you can also change scripts between Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n or change the position within a level by changing it elsewhere . this will only happen if they draw an entry from the range of the availability system services .
note : entries are postpon@@ ed when you choose them in a new section . to just select it to a new Run@@ level , you must choose from the menu Edit or from the context menu , even if the same entry has previously existed in the target area of the action .
the s@@ orting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case you have to edit the s@@ orting of the surrounding entries before you can once again try to insert the system service .
note : currently there is no way to re@@ produce entries that were thrown into the tr@@ ash . so be careful .
you can use the tab@@ ulator button to enable the different work areas ( avail@@ ables system services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) and the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one .
to post@@ p@@ one entry into another Run@@ level , move it to the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ trl ; X ) and paste it into the desired Run@@ level with inser@@ ting ( C@@ trl ; V ) .
to change the variety number or the name of an entry manually , press the tab button to switch the properties dialog . connect the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to release the changes .
because of the risk of the account amount , all entries in the menu will require a confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . default settings are performed in the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) . if they are available from &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; re@@ produced . changes to preferences will be stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I have experim@@ ented with the standard @-@ Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n and now the machine starts resistant to date . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO Pro@@ m@@ pt lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the standard Run@@ level on a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
I have some system services provided with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you use &amp; S@@ use ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc , which are only available in this distribution . please read the details in the manual of your distribution .
the way how system services can be started in these distribu@@ tions , but does not simplify the configuration of the propri@@ etary em@@ body programs of this distribution , but does not correspond to any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an expansion of the program for this approach .
if you use a different distribution : check if all configuration files are available , which are required by the respective system service ( and also whether they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or htt@@ p@@ d ) just terminate without notice when their configuration files are not present or false .
the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use a different distribution , please send me information about the Run@@ level , so that this manual can be added .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to begin with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ;
once you have made changes , you have to save it . either use the appropriate icon of the toolbar or the entry saved in the menu file .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two card cards , the user interface and the user groups . for editing you choose the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry . it appears the dialog User , or Group properties .
some boxes are shown only if you have advanced system settings . only if you have advanced system settings , a box @-@ card will be created on which you can make individual settings . further card cards seem to appear , if shadow pass@@ codes , or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as in BSD counter@@ mix@@ es are installed .
the card @-@ card password is displayed , if shadow pass@@ codes , or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as in BSD -@@ Uni@@ ces are installed .
this cart@@ on card appears only if for at least a one @-@ connected fil@@ es@@ ystem ( Qu@@ ota ) is enabled and initi@@ alized ( recogni@@ z@@ able at the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the fil@@ es@@ ystem ) . here you can change parameters for each user , whereas the space restrictions are stored in KB :
these parameters can be set individually for each file system . the current file system is selected by means of the field file system with space @-@ file system
the card @-@ card groups inform@@ s about the group members of the selected users . the standard group , which the user is heard , you will find in the field of prim@@ eval group . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by highlight this in the large field .
the dialog properties tab includes a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or group , select Add from the menu user or group or click the appropriate adding button . the Edit or delete the selected user or the selected group is analog .
with this module , you can install the LI@@ LO boot , remove and change the time up to the bo@@ oting of the standard operating system , remove the standard operating system , remove , change and remove more .
