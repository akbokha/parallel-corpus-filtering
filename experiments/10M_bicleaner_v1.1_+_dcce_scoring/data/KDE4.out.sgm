<seg id="2">If a part of the text is selected, only this part is translated into the entire & URL.</seg>
<seg id="3">Machine translations are only very rudimentary. babelfish produced in the best case a crude translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, the translations shall not be dependent on important decisions without the translation ahead.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only web pages on the Internet can be translated. other texts should allow you to translate at the babelfish page itself, where you can insert translation texts directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">The package & package; contains various modules for & conqueror; despite their small size, they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some features of & conqueror; by making them easier.</seg>
<seg id="6">For more information on the use of & Konqueror; and the built-in functions can be found in the manual & Konqueror;</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in the & Konqueror; please select Settings.... Open the box tools and select the desired modules.</seg>

<seg id="12">To use the DOM-builders in the & Konqueror; select extras DOM tree tree... and open a new window with the DOM of the current document. as default, the display begins with the root knots of the document, example: documentelement, all other nodes are subelements of this root-notation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & Konqueror; represents another view of objects with the MIME type incorporation / directory in local files. it can be used as an alternative for the various symbols and text screens so that you can view the content of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">The speciality of & FSView; it consists of portraded folder hierarchies with the help of a so-called Tree-Map. each object is proportional to its size. this size must possess proportional to its size. this size must possess the property that the sum of sizes of the orderly objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">At & FSView; the size is the size of a file or a folder, whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries. in this way, large files can be easily recognized, even if they can be seen far down in the Ordina archy. accordingly, & FSView can be considered as a graphical and interactive version of the UNIX command command.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView; it is an entry in the tread-presentation a rectangle that represents a file or folder in your filesystem. to simplify navigation, the right edge can provide reasonable colour and damage settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle that is switched on display color mode, the depth can be set for the slight detection of the casing depth or the representation of another file, such as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the various properties of the corresponding file or folder. for each property, you can specify if there is enough space for representation, or whether the area of subordinates can be used (although permitting error by constraints on signs of the loyalty). in addition, you can specify the relative position of marking in the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">When working algorithms for Treemaps should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry. at the Treaties in & FSView; this goal is not always compelled to represent the nesting entries of the entries, and this frame will no longer be available. note that less space is lost for the frame when the rectangle is quadratic.</seg>
<seg id="20">As division of the surface of an entry for the subordinate items will be effected. here it is necessary for the testing and prevention of space-lusts by frame always beneficial the surfaces are emerging, which are as quadratic. the best methods of this are rows, columns or recorders.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can specify the minimum presented area for an entry over the menu entry view. instead, a smoking pattern is drawn into the surface of the higher amount, to indicate that this area is actually occupied by an orderly entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally & FSView was intended as a small test application and introduction to the use of the TreeMap widgets developed for the use of KCachegrind.</seg>
<seg id="23">The module image gallery can be found in the & Konqueror; menu with the extras picture gallery... or with Ctrl; I.</seg>

<seg id="56">& digicame; contains a fast image processing with basic editing tools. you can use this to assess your photos, comment and correct. the processing capabilities can be easily expanded with KDE image plugins Interface (manual) modules.</seg>
<seg id="57">Although & digicame, easy to use, it provides duser-used professional skills. it works fully in 16-bit color foam and all available modules support the raw converting by means of libraw, DNG export and ICC houral workflow.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with significantly more metadata, such as & eg; over the camera or the lens to search for.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like everyone & kde; programmes are also & digitised; an open source project. that means it's dependent on the support of the end user. therefore, you should notify me of problems and improvement.</seg>
<seg id="60">& digicame; try to make the detector of problems or suggestions as easy as possible for them. here, the help menu provides an entry problem or wishes....

<seg id="62">You can also visit the digitised; homepage to learn news about shared versions and other information about & digicame.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to get to & digicame; to participate, the registration in the developer's mailing list. guide to the log in in the developer mailing list of & digicame;.</seg>
<seg id="64">If you start & digivor; for the first time, you will be asked to specify your pictures and your database. you can simply specify a local, remote or remote folder. enter a folder name or click on the folder icon folder folder to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field you need to specify a local folder on your computer. here, the data collection will be stored. this path remains the same for all image folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can soap as many folders like you want. & digicame; will you use in addition as an Albenlibrary. settings digivertebral Collections</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard disk, you can specify the top folder containing pictures as basic folders. & digitization; considers every subfolder as an album. no picture is changed. during the search of the folder you will get a progress view like this:</seg>
<seg id="68">& digivor; durging recursive the librarian in all its depth. you can not include subfolders unless it's iste in hidden folder. this can take you outside & digitised, take a point before the name of the subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder containing photos as the basic folder, you will notice that the albums will take in Meine Albenlist no photos as symbols. you can change the photo by taking a popular photo from the album and then use this on the folder symbol. you will find further details in the section albums.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you have configured the basic folder, you can create in & digitised; your digital camera, then you should learn how to use Meine's albums and mates keyword to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">Raw support: if you use the raw mode of your camera, so can & digitization also. the support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the menu Help Texture support.</seg>

<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are signed by the use of Compact & Flash; memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transfer. for the actual transmission to the machine, the camera will then be implemented as a record project (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras will be used under circumstances for connecting the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">& digitization; uses the program gPhoto2 to communicate with digital cameras, which a constantly increasing number of more than 800 cameras supported. gPhoto2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol, a far-spread protocol, which is developed by the International Imaging Industry Association and other peripherals without the need additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial interface for your communication with the computer. da photos in general are large files and transmission via the serial port are slow, this connection has now turned out. & digitised; supports these cameras and leads the transmission of images with gPhoto2 through. a complete list of supported cameras will be found under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphotograph2 has to be created with libexif support, the exif support is provided by some libgphoto2 camera operators. if the exif support is not in libgphoto2. if the exif support is not possible in libgphoto2. if the exif support may not be noticed, or the generation could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things in & digicame; is how easy its functionality through modules can be extended:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI modules: the KDE Image plugins Interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a common modular structure for & digitising;, KPhotoalbum, Showimg and Gwenview. goal is to provide the modules to all video programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate pictures in virtually any way, as it can also be a user. your advantage is that it is much easier to complement & digitization; by writing a small module to complement an function than the changes in & digitised; even perform.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either remove the page with & LMB; remove or switch in full screen mode with F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">Editing and stretching of pictures works everywhere: you can place an image in another part of the tree, over the horizontal separating line or in another application window. the only restriction is that a picture is not able to put into keywords, data slider or search.</seg>

<seg id="149">I dare to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer, then you need not even know how many photos you have, then you don't even need to save the metadata both in a database and in the image files, so that you can access a fast search and a secure archiving to which you can access with other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you do and need to know anything to fit into your system is the establishment of information structure in contrast to the data structure. you must decide whether others want to have access to your photos or on a network drive & etc. note that you have to switch to a larger drive sometime.</seg>
<seg id="151">Maybe you will be happy with this structure. holiday pictures can quickly be found throughout your dates. if you make enough photos, then you will use subfolders like & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc; use. export is a folder of images to print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have different requirements such as sealing of photos, archiving, workflows, constant supply of pictures on different themes and a large number of everything. within 10 years there will be 95% archives and 5% working files and you will then not rebuild your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">Which types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes the stacker processing simpler. separate new of old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you're looking for an original or a derived image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the metadata option to store metadata in the introduction of metadata in & digitization. this makes sure that Exif- and IPTC data can be stored into the file by selecting the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the appropriate item on the menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens when you want to change? this includes a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work begins, as you now need to apply any keywords, captions and review. of course you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then put the value. you start the best with the rating or the rank. this makes sense, since you can concentrate on the best photos.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let's now let ourselves with keywords, keywords, as you are often called for other programs, or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import catalozed images from another source with embedded keywords, then & digitised, automatically insert the tree for you bzw the pictures to the right place. the changed keywords are done by & digims; updated during it the subtrees are persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows how different metadata are overcut. this is a very crude representation, since each block of metadata in truth consists of many sections. filename and calendar data are characteristics of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough the keywords - the next section refers to damages or comments, the third important tool to catalog your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You don't want to let your photos just see your photos just let them share with your friends, your family, other photographers and agencies. they are certainly interested in getting your photos arrive.</seg>
<seg id="163">Take a look at this panorama. from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you look at it closer, you start to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I tell you this one of the Aldefield of Allied & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy. Wow! you start to dream, associations, the historical time span is represent, you might even hear the silence. so the damaging has changed your perception of this panorama.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others who consider your photos, the title may be more important than the picture itself to generate an interest. if you show images you should tell a story. remember that the key is the meaning to the viewer to help Him through the motif you have moved to understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine when a picture is not perfect when it has the strength to work only with an inscription for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digitisation, you can export as much text, at an internationalised alphabet (UTF-8), when you use your images in Web-galleries, then these signs may be exported to your preferences in the labelling and / or the title of the web-gallery system. you do not have to tell the story for the opener.</seg>
<seg id="168">Do you remember the times before GPS? when you had to find into a different city without navigation system? it was not a tedious planet in GoogleEarth? well, because with images the train of the spatial presentation now already starts with light speed.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities to exploiting the Geolocation are already innisable and will be able to repeat itself in the future, you can also export your travels via pictures with geographic data. & digitization also, the photos can also export you to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc. with the GoogleMaps viewer.</seg>

<seg id="172">The author (synonym for creator and author): this field should add your name, or the name of the person who has created the photo. if it is not desired, the name of the photographer can be used, then the name of a company or organization has been stored. this field does not support commas nor semicolons as separator.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author title (synonym for capitals): associated with the author. this field contains the working designation of the photographer. examples of this can be titles as: employee, freelance photographer or independent photographer. as this is a comment on the car field, this field has to be filled out.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for providers): use the provider, to identify who you are. this does not necessarily have the author. if the photographer can be listed here, then you can find the picture to others. if the picture is a bearing photo, then the group / agency will provide the image here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, although this is no longer a protection against abuse. everyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computer can delete or modify the solution for this problem are digital watermark. for individuals, this is very important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and half-pros this protection is very important for it.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique each image unique. & digicame; in the near future, such a module can be used for stacking processing.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: PLATTENFEHLER, record loss, ECC, transmission errors, ageing of storage media, restoration, redundancy, lifestyle, temperature, data size, widespread superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course, we are not talking about CDs that were lost on the street or a fire. these kind of loss are the same that can also be done with traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section it is possible to solve problems with the new media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll Ontrack, the biggest data recovery company in the world, has some interesting statistics, which has a loss of data.</seg>
<seg id="180">To fight the problem with CDs / DVDs must be treated cautious and you can no longer stay longer than a couple of years. of course, you can also buy CDs and DVDs in food quality. there are offers on gold coated DVDs, & dollars; 2 people who claim a lifetime of 100 years for themselves. whether you believe it is in your brass room.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD Disks can be unreadable, but you can use this risk in which you use good Disks and good recording guarantee and they are not much more costly than the cheapest but you write much more reliable, so you write the right choice.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to faults, even if you have just written only effective data, the rest we needed for the formatting and the control summing. despite this massive protection, it is required by chemical aging, ultraviolet light, dust and etc.</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs there is a favorable program called IsoBuster which apparently causes miracles in CDs and DVDs. it also does not work for Macs. there are also similar applications that damaged data from damaged floppies, hard disks, flashmedia, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray Disks seem to win the formats against the HD DVD. a dual-layer Blu-ray disk can store 50 GB and thus almost sixteen the capacity of a dual-layer DVD with 8,5 GB. everything that has been said to CDs and DVDs also applies for the Blu-ray disk.</seg>
<seg id="185">Then burn slowly with a good recording guarantee on high-quality media in a non-proprietary format. if you need to store the media with a description, date & author, and afterwards on animals protected site. do not forget to transfer the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read this media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Diskmanufacturers keep your statistics for itself. your manufacturer guarantees a new disk, but not the data. Google produces on this subject a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard disks: disinfallization</seg>
<seg id="187">Shortly: discovers keep on the longest if you are operated in the temperament range of 35 ° C up to 45 ° C. in lower temperament, the most common error matter, SMART can not notice this error. some of SMART identified errors. these are in particular readers and publisher loads. the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete dispatest due to over voltage. of course you can also have data loss due to an electric if you have secured the files, but this losses can normally be produced without any major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electrical devices does not hide much power, that can result in devices with computer chips and high-speed keyboards, complete data loss, hardships, hardboards, destructive motherboards and other defective. protect yourself from the unavoidable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most widespread protection against blacktips is a transverse protection. this is a device that some of the energy heat absorbed and the rest grounded. it's usually available in the form of a plug-in. do not think any plug-in is also included.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overtime protection, then you should pay attention to the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also consider that it provides protection against flashes and thus protects the properly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since you can use over voltage of any cable to your computer, you should consider that also all peripherals connected to your system are also protected. some manufacturers put over voltage simulator and also contain a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connection possibilities for the coaxial cable of cable-modems and TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, you will need a portable overload protection. a variety of these devices are specially developed for notebooks and therefore contain very small and you also contain the protection for the modem. so you are ideal for travel.</seg>
<seg id="194">While an overflight protection your system protects from smaller oscillations in the power lines, it will not really help you during a complete waste. even an failure of a few seconds may result in loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore be useful to invest in a breaking-free power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to the protection against overvoltages, these devices can be automatically available cordless energy when a blackout occurs. if you buy a USV, you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as an overload protection. in addition, the life time of the battery and the combined software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Concerns the potential risk that your computer system is exposed and and compare his safety in power problems with the cost of avoiding this. a high quality overvoltage range can be you up to & euro; 40. this is just a small prize slice if you think how well your computer is protected. at the end you should remember all cable before you go to the holidays.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web-Service includes S3 storage service - a simple memory service. with the right configuration, you can use this as drive under & Linux; Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use this as a backup destination for your software. Google Shared Storage is another popular offer to store any amount of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">They are at home compared to the hard disks, although very expensive - 40 GB costs & dollars; 75 per year and 400 GB costs & dollars; 500. in addition, you must send the data to the comparatively slow Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore suitable only as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images. it is not a bad solution, but it is not a general locking solution. for this, it is too slow.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo-Community 23hq.com make online store services available to photos. their free space provides you more at full resolution online. the professional variant provides you more available, in case of Flickr dramatic more. for 25 $a year you get unlimited memory, which should be checked in reality.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of data security, the web solutions are very secure. transmission errors are automatically regulated thanks to the TCP protocol and with the large firms are included in the offer a backup and a distributor memory. thus they are desasterate.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in calculator. all transmission errors are prone to transmission errors. the file system ZFS and bust represent at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive safely.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that you did not say if this is happening in your hardware. all these disorders can stay undetected until you have no protection in your computer. no one seems to have thought of it. no one seems to have thought of it. the internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than that in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supply are another source of transmission loss since it generate interference within the data currents. under normal file systems, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are currently not particularly affected by transmission problems, you should look to the future. already 2010 you will see thousands of bugs per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS of Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle lower faults at low level. it's open source, with many patents and is available under one to the GPL incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it will soon also be available for & Linux; and Windows is available.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has launched its own initiative with its blower filesystem. this is still in the Alpha status. it uses the same protections of the ZFS and is also available for & Linux; it is still not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Underestimate this not! these two factors are responsible for 86% of the data loss in the notebook and 46% at the workplace systems. notebooks are already the proportion of the theft of 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most of viruses. it leads to a lower damage, than for example against theft or reinstallations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; it has been no longer seen anymore.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open Source file systems are less susceptible to data loss as proprietary systems: false, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to name the spread file systems. you can find a very good English article here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: false, only the speed of the investigation process at a sudden interruption during an operation is higher and an undefinable status will be avoided before the problem appeared, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the biggest threat to digital data: false, theft and human errors are the root causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings from fundamental physical limitations. community is that while the technology is further developed there is a natural frontier for this progress. sensitivity and smoky-characteristic for all types of light sensors are far from that border no longer far away.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go towards the 10 megapixelic sensors. even if this resolution is already too high for computing cameras and high quality optics are the optimum for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have your border with 10-12 Megapixel. for higher resolutions, you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">An 750GB disk drive you tonight for 100 & euro. so do not make anyone else responsible for the data loss. so please backup your data frequently according to a plan and test this backup before you create anything like the reinstall of your operating system, the exchange of plates or the size change of hard disk drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your backups on an external SATA drive. if, then one day, a flash suggests you are lucky when the drive was not connected in the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster defeats locally to and destroy a lot. forget aircraft: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous for your data. they normally affect an entire room or the complete house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, Desaster does not always mean any local storage. bring your backups the stairs up to the neighbour's house, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as above mentioned is a common reason for a data loss despite securing the panic. if you have a backup, which is not immediately available, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all the files is to be backed up. it is a snapshot of a snapshot without a history and represents a complete copy at a time of time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Difference insurance: a backup of the files have been altered since the last complete backup. created a complete snapshot of two points: the complete backup and the final analysis of the process.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files changed since the last backup has been changed. you can restore the original status at any time. this backup comes from a sealed system at the next with the exception that it is just repasted and not continuously.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily create on your machines. in contrast to script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file-controlled scripts, rsync only the difference of files that were really changed. this will be compressed and if you want to increase security via ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Backup important images directly after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or other optical medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">This procedure can give you enough time to uncover loss and restore. at the same time you come back for backup but with & lt; 130% of the size of work files. in the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot should be done manually, after which you have made a complete check.</seg>
<seg id="226">Themes: metadata, stored in the image file stored IPTC information, associated XMP files, original, memory, scalability, media, relocate images and metadata, copy the images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization,..., use of the internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">So that valuable images will survive the next 40 years that is about the time span in which you really are interested in you because they should remember your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be observed:</seg>
<seg id="228">Since the future due to your nature is unpredictable you must look at all what today is said with caution. unfortunately, there is no other way than to make some vigilance while the current system are backward. the less variants you have used in the past, so that is easier to assess the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This issue should actually be answered from the explanations in this document. use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is nowadays available for anyone. so if you have an old system, you keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the Council is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, your memory and visual technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the expert set for the possibility to change a system in its size. this actually means to enlarge.</seg>
<seg id="233">Sometimes we assume that you have planned the scalability and set the area you want to enlarge a dedicated top or partition. at * nix Systems such as & Linux; you can copy this area and store it on a new record:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg, whether your new record was realized by the system, but do not hang it on.</seg>
<seg id="235">& Dollar; dd if = / dev / sdb / Sdc # source is / dev / sdb, the new record is / dev / sdc / dollar; # works with ext2,3, FAT16, 32 and ReiserFS. / dev / sadc1 # change the size of ReiserFS if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open Source standards have the big advantage of an open specification. even if one day no software does not exist, then you can create it yourself. this task is easier by year to year simpler.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that disappears slowly from the market. you should not use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG is designed as an open source standard of GIF. it may be much more. it is distressing, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, but not as many as TIFF, but not as many as TIFF need and a slow-expression. this format we would like to recommend you to store your images.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as a picture format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed shape or in a container with a sliding-free compression mode (defect). however, a problem is however, that this format is adapted by many people. therefore, there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digitale Negative file format is a licensed free and open resource format that developed by Adobe Systems. DNG was developed exclusively on the TIFF / EP format and fully committed to the use of metadata. one handful companions sets DNG already now and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon it at some time.</seg>
<seg id="241">This may be one of the reasons why, in 2001, Adobe its XML-based XMP technology has been introduced to replace the & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. it is a marker with extension & quot; .xmpquot; stored for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers draw it from an original of your recording, mostly in slipping image. XMP does not fit through the image file, but it can be noted in problems with the link between the metadata and the image file. therefore, you should think about whether you use DNG as a container and put it all there together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata communities, which includes a large range of application and modelling, discussions and collaborative work in the DCMI communities and DCMI groups, annual conferences and workshops, basic connections and educational efforts to reach a far-reaching acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the pictures are on the camera podium, you can use this as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them in your archive archive. this function is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a refined editing you can use external programs. if you have the pictures again with & digitised, then you should add the metadata again. these were cut down from the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the edited paintings for copyright with a digital watermark. export them then into webgalleries, coding in MPEG, use in contact sheets, print & etc.</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digitisation. in the Adding of a photo to an album you will find a description as you've already installed on your hard drive. but the camera interface will give you many advanced settings to importing images to your Albendatenate bank.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digitised, connect it to the display mode, connect the camera to the display mode to switch off and turn off. a further description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, they try to connect with your camera. when the connection is made, a ferous view of all photos on the camera will appear. some cameras do not display a preview images. if this is the case, the file names are displayed and a symbol for file order for each file, photos, movies, music etc. on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you might need any camera information about each entry. with the page features and metadata from the camera interface you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog displays file properties and photographic information that can be stored internally from the camera. a symbol indicates that the picture has not been downloaded to your computer. note that in some digital cameras do not be available all the information.</seg>
<seg id="253">The tab metadata displays the internal metadata, such as exif, manufacturer indicated, GPS etc. of the image. this information is the same as in the metadata page from the main window of & digitising; or the picture processing. please note that these metadata are not available at some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button Download and then download the selection from All. this invites you to download the photos and we recommend you check if the pictures were downloaded instantly in an album before you deleted the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download all photos, you can only choose the desired using the standard optional methods from & kde; select the item you download and then download the download page. the button below Download the button for download until you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, is an option New Download available. these pictures have not been downloaded by & digitization. in this case, the new images are downloaded with a star at the forefront row. if you choose this option, only the new pictures are downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you want to download the buttons for download or download selected, appears in which the photos are stored. the list of existing albums will be sorted whenever normal folder is sorted, shown in Section Meine's section. select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After you selected the target album, click OK, and & digitised; loads the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete all of them at once, by selecting the button deleting. if you just want to delete it and use them deleted.</seg>
<seg id="260">Note that there is no possibility to recover the photos you deleted from the camera; so they will be completely deleted. so you should carefully review whether the photos are successfully deleted in a & digious; however, you should delete it from the camera. if you want to delete it from camera, since this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras use as filename for the photos often do not be particularly meaningful again. the file names are usually deleted again after the photos from the camera will load. therefore, it can be useful to integrate the date and time on which the image was taken to integrate into the filename.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for turning and spies of the picture and for file-based undertaking. if you use this last option automatically a folder a day will be created.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options During the transfer opens three more options that are performed before the photos on the disk. the first two concern the data on the author Standard Autotty. with the last option you can correct date & time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you wish to use a different file format than standard format, you can use e.g. in machining foto-% Y-% M-% d% H:% M:% S. turn off the option Date & time. for more adjustments you should read the help of the command strftime.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the Camera filename, you have the option to change the filename in small letters lines. or in large letters, if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new filename, the & digicame; for a photo used, below the name, the camera will be displayed in the preview. your settings to rename will be stored and automatically used when you open the camera lens.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digicame; can use all the information about the orientation of the camera to a punctuation recording. not all cameras present these information. in the section of page row metadata, you can read further details about the information that your camera is embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic turn is usually turned on, and if your camera does not supply this information, leaves the photo in the original orientation. if you want to turn off the automatic rotation, use the button heighted and select the automatic rotation at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera has been made about the date, where the photo was made, I can create & digib; this subverbs will be loaded onto the image data. all pictures with the same date will be loaded into the same subalbum. not all cameras present this information. in the section sidebar Meta-Data you can read, which information can be embedded into the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is normally off, and in this case save & digitization; the photos directly on target album. if you want to change this option. use the button below and select the option file-based undertaking at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to load photos from their computer on their camera is the button Download. select then upload. choose the file selector & kde; appears in which you can select files uploaded, you can also select more than one file with the default & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">Once the images are settled, asks & digitization; you, where the images are loaded high. select a folder selection dialog for the camera. select the desired folder and click OK to start the upload. the images will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. it is a position that can be displayed in longitude and latitude, and which can be displayed on a map. determining the data can be performed by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European Galileo or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers it may be interesting to link a picture with an precise geographical location. not everyone uses a plane to credit an area through automatic recording of GPS data. environmental planer, military, police, architecture offices and real estate makler can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you've forgotten later, where exactly the photo was made, you can post a browser which shows the area. if you want to send a postcard to another & digitisation, users who want to locate the place of photos, or just want to document this aspect, it is well to provide position's position.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is how does the GPS data come into the picture? first, you should know that there are many GPS data fields such as the direction, saddle and ticket Reference. there are at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the right hardware, via a reprocessing of GPS data and image files with the KIPI module for geographic assignment.</seg>

<seg id="297">With the setting PNG-Compression you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce the image quality, as PNG need a hide-free algorithm. the only effect is that the picture dates back more time to output and pack. if you have a rapid calculator, you can set this value to a high compression. it means 1: a low and 9 a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the option TIFF-files compressing you can switch the defender -compressionsalg.mus for TIFF-pictures. this reduces the size of the black images. it has no effect on image quality, since the defensive algorithm has not been working.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the setting losses-free JPEG-2000 files you can save lostless. even if you have written the descriptive setting, the relationship between quality loss and file size was far better than with normal JPEG. when this paragraph was not yet supported, but there were not yet in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In the previous versions of & digitised, the image processing was only a picture-view for photos. currently, it is very fast to a tool for manipulation of your photos. with this dialog you can change the settings of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default gain is that all green pixels are equal. if you use this option with a minimum loss of details, this difference creates a mesh in the output. this option identifies a bit soft, eliminated but the 2x2 lattice model with the VNG- or the AHD-quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">When this option is set, the white equals of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used when the white equals is not set. standard is it a fixed color balance, based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is supported only for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. the use of the second sensors has the effect that underexposed images in four steps will get more details in the detector. for other cameras this option will be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is it the reddish, so the parts of your images are burned down, due to the inability of your camera the shredded white. use this setting crossed out in various roatöfe. lastly, you can try some parts of missing information from the detector to reconstruct.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels in general not feel as fast satible as green and red. & digib therefore try the missing green and red proportions from the yet not saturated blue pixel. of course this is a question how much colour or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the option, you get the option to put a level. here a value of three is a compromise and can therefore be adapted individually for each image.</seg>
<seg id="308">Put the luminous value to your taste. you probably have to put it a bit higher than the standard 1. however, this can also be done later in the picture options of & digitiments. in order to keep the time for dehumidities small, you should proceed conservative.</seg>

<seg id="318">There are other options like the Soft-proof profile, with which you can emulate what your picture of a device would be back. this is very useful to print as your printer has a smaller color area than your camera and some colours therefore can be very satisfied, instead of leaving on the blinded algorithm of your printer.</seg>

<seg id="338">The image processing contains a series of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & digitising; so they are not part of your distribution. you can find more information about the KIPI modules in the section.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status line at the bottom of the window, the filename, current filename, enlargement factor and the current image size shows.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar on the top and including the toolbar for fast access to the most frequently used functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of the image processing alter your photos. however, any of the functions will change the original photo before using it or used the button save from the toolbar. note that you can no longer restore the original photo as soon as you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you should possibly customize a copy of your image before you change it. this allows you to save it with File Save as complete.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original balance by using the Settings File Recovery or use the button 'button' button in the toolbar. you then lose each change that you have done on the photo since the last time.</seg>
<seg id="344">Almost every action of the image processing can be reversed or restored. the last action you can make back-run by selecting rendering or restored by selecting Edit from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you often use this, you should turn the keyboard shortcut, Ctrl. -Z to recede and Ctrl.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB; about the return or reproduce button in the toolbar, you will receive a context menu. if you select one of the menu applications, all the actions are also reversed or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started image processing, you can move between photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar. if you've made changes on the current photo, you will be asked if you want to save it.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can take in the picture and perform zooming in which you use Ctrl. mouse wheel or symbols in the toolbar or the entries in the insured menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: magnifier factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View full screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode. you come to the normal view, in which you use the Esc button. usually, you can view this in motion dialog by & digitised, change it from the & digitization; main window will view. see the section for inserting the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the actual picture, you can select in the menu picture and get the default & cde; print dialog. you can customize the settings before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print individual pictures or whole sentences. entire picture-pages can choose from your selection. you only need to select the pictures with the standard methods and select from the menu album exporting printers. if you follow the wizard, you only need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & digitization; main window has a sidebar on the right edge, which provides important information and actions for the selected images. the same page row is available without the navigation device. it is displayed when one of the five rider is clicked on:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multifaches Click on the same rider makes the page bar appearing or disappear into the border.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the printable view, you can insert or insert screenings with unlimited size. the text is UTF-8 compatible. that means all special signs are allowed. the complements will be copied into the EXIF- and IPTC- fields so that you can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data support only ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are cut according to 2000 characters and special characters will be reformed. if you want to use the IPTC labelling field in other applications, you should consider these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you commented it, you either use the button or just change the next picture, the captions will then be saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">In addition to the applied-button, there is a button More. with this you can read further metadata in the selected file or database. however, you can also read the metadata in the files. however, this will always be performed if you have selected a metadata settings that is always written in the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="359">The rating shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting. it can be used either with a single mouse-click on the 5 stars in the page row or with the keyboard shortcut. to evaluate multiple images at the same time, select it and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The rating is written in the IPTC field. the coding follows the schema in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keywords display a search box for filtering the keywords, the keywords, and a file-box with the previously used in this & digitiled; -session was attached.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is adjusted dynamically to the given search keyword. you can quickly restrict the number of possibilities in search of a keyword. this ability is particularly useful if you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom is another relief in entering keywords in a picture series. if you have given various keywords, these are stored for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by markers of the appropriate bonds fields in the tree; all the keywords of an image are stored in the IPTC field keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If several pictures are selected in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword, this is only applied to the highlighted picture and not on the entire selection, if you want to have a selection with a keyword, please read the keyword filter.</seg>
<seg id="366">The page row, keyword filter is used to change the selection of displayed in the main window. usually, the left page row will be used with their album, dates, keyword and search views. if in addition one or more keywords are used from the right, the cutting-item is displayed on the right. all the keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also draw and put it. suppose you have selected in the main view several pictures to provide you with keywords. if the keyword already exists, you can simply drag it out of the right sidebar and put on the selection. then a dialog you ask if you want to put the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window shows the images on a calendar tag. the keyword filter is selected in no keywords, selected the quantity of three pictures. they were selected with Ctrl + a, and then, a keyword from the right keyword tree was moved and there. a dialog asks if this keyword should be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place every time of the program. you can also be disabled at Settings.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created and determine that it should be one or would have to change it easily with a double-clicking on the text and the rules.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry in which in the database is searching for. this may be an album, name, keyword, keyword, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or a string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can specify a Extended search on all elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you only need the paddle at the end of the rule and then use the button groups. the options are then as follows:</seg>

<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was written mainly by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I found it mostly on & digicame; s concrete implementation adapted.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you use a color-managed workflow, that the colors will come from your camera or scanner, you can achieve that the colors on your monitor, those from your camera or scanner, and the colors you print or publish in the web that suit you from your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">When the theme is based on colour management, then everyone wants to push for the outcomes which he wants. unfortunately, the meaning of this tutorial is to provide you with adequate information about colour management. in addition, you should make links with deeper information to make your own informal decisions and make you obtain the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image runs all the six listed below, you must not take care of colour management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You are working on a monitor that is calibrated at the sRGB-Farbraum. (more information can be found below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other image files are sent by e-mail or the web, where the RGB of de-facto standard is standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB works so well and makes life for everyone so easy, why should one use another color tree and so that thoughts have to make thoughts over colouring books?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of limitation of sRGB compared to the colors that we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors that we can see, the hufiisenshaped region, and the colours in the sRGB color tree, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger color trees, so visit Bruce Lindblooms excellency page and then click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Must I improve my monitor if I decided to work only in the sRGB color tree?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you work in the sRGB-Farbraum, or not, you need to monitor your monitor, since sRGB is that your; onitor can work on sRGB mode, so you must either use your monitor on the RGB RGB RGB mode), then you must either use your monitor on the sRGB Standard Edition or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool presents five automatic corrections which can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before you attempt a further manual process.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions normalize, dissimilar and contrast enhancement from the menu correct automatic correction automatically try out of your colors the best. you will have to experiment with these effects, to see which best suits your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method will scaled the luminous values over the entire image so that the darkest point black and the brightest point as bright as possible will change without its color padding. this function is often a stomach correction for pictures that are dark or washed.</seg>
<seg id="391">The same: this method jusses the luminance of the colors of the selected image, so that the histogram of an image is as flat as possible. at times, it has the same very good results in improving the contrast of an image. sometimes it also produces a very powerful operation that affects either miracles in a picture or it destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic in the same way: this method maximises the colour area in the red, green and blue-channel. it detects the dark and bright thresholds and jusites the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram area.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improves the contrast and luminosity of the RGB values of an image by the postpone of the lowest and highest values on the greatest possible range and a resumance of all values between them. this is only visible in mature images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The whitewing of & digitised, is a semi-automatic tool to perform the whitewing of a picture.</seg>
<seg id="395">The whitewing correction is slightly restricted as over a color tree with 8-bit per colour. in case you can perform far from the originating area, which works with overexposure mode, which works in 16-bit mode, so your ways to make correction better off.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white abruptive-mism of the copyright by Pawel T. Melym. you start him via the menu entry colors white.</seg>
<seg id="397">The pronunciation can be adjusted in size. on the left are both the originating picture as well as the preview of the target image. the preview is adjusted dynamically to the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original white straight, then it suffice on the lower window.</seg>
<seg id="398">The thumbnails of the target photos has a red marker. the Luminance of the Pixels under this marker is shown as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">To the right above, a histogram is displayed, as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful to, even in well illuminated images, most of the pixels very small lamuminate levels. with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed. the sum is called Luminaire.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. the shadow penises lets you improve the shadow details of your photos or even down measurements.</seg>
<seg id="401">Anstat works with the above controls placed on pips, you should use the color temperature of Pipette. press on this button and then somewhere on the picture show to use the color temperature of the White-like color. in this way, the temperature and green values will be automatically set.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white equals with the list of preferences. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indication increases the colors when more than a color channel of the Pixels is overexposed.. You will see the combined result in the white-comparison. this is displayed in the previewed as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The buttons Save as and load exactly this. every setting of the white dress you can set up here in a text file and later reload it.</seg>
<seg id="405">The knob preferences set out all filtering values again on their default values as well as the pertinent white cream. please note that also the neutral settings may be found another photo as your original text. if you save it, your originality will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can set here the cothicker depth per colour-channel of the ordered image. 8-bit cocoding is a widely used JPEG format, 16-bit cocoding is better for high-quality pictures. this coding requires also more panel, calculation time and stands available for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the processing of raw images. it uses the change and the assignment of colour profilly. color-tone mapping may be carried out by the underbalance for the brightness. a detailed guide for the use of colours can be drawn up in the chapter of colour management.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool can be found in the menu under Color Tonvalue Correction. this tool makes an integrated way to store several color channels at the same time. this is helpful if your camera or scanner always use the same error and you can always find the same correction. in the manual you need more information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful option to fix the coating process is the tool for the Gradation that you will find in the colours of Gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digious; tool color-effects will give you four color-effects, a solar installation, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a canteen-filter at your disposal.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of the chemical processing, Solarisation, also called Sabatians, an effect of the image was destroyed by the extra light. this had the effect that the lighter ranges darker and the colors were inverted by the second lighting. the result was a partial negation of the image. this tool allows you to try this interesting effect fine.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the Solarisation. at about 50% intensity the picture shows what chemically possible is possible. another raise is finally creating a negative image that doesn't generate on photo paper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar installation. the original albild is the (1) and this is working (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid-Filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquoth; effect. it is different from a saturation that he has a stronger contrast-effects that makes the colors brilliant and smooth. try it simple, he embellished many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name provided by the Japanese company FUJIFILM. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and hence a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts. this characterization make him a film of choice for nature photographers. Velvias are very saturated color but also some photographers, especially those of the most beautiful landscapes.</seg>
<seg id="416">The Neonfilter simulates Neonlight on the contrasts. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repetitions the strength of Neonlichs. in large images the filter can reload the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not uncommon that you want to correct the color-trast and luminosity of your photos with the tools in the menu under colours. all your judicial authorities can be viewed in preview. once you are satisfied with the result you use the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you get a photo by low light conditions, you can get the reversed problem: one to big satiation. even in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation can reduce it. any changes you can perform in preview. if your result you like the result you can confirm your changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tools Gradation and the simple light intensity / gamma / gamma is the instrument of toning correction to improve the exposure. even though the dialog to this tool is very complicated, you need for the details explained here in the area of sliders. made of concrete the three sliders below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graphs of intensity, a histogram, active channel, or of the selected area. below graphs are three sliders in which are clicked and the left side represents the dark Ones and the right side represents the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to use the waiter is to postpone the regulator and watch it on how the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right hand, the original and preview of the picture can be viewed. the preview is dynamically based on the settings of the image. on the left, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this file box can be adjusted whether the histogram is represented with a linear or logarithmic Y axis. in pictures of a digital camera, the linear histogram is dominating from a single pillar. in this case, the logarithmic classification is useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three regulator: the top for the dark's tones, the average for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones, commonly called gammaves.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three colour-chains can be used in the preview of the original image, in order to automatically extinguish the seekers of shadows, middle and light tones. in addition, there is a button for fully automatic alignment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Out-rated: the extenders allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two regulators to change interactively like in the input assessment. the compression of the outgate can be used for example to create an outfit picture as the background, while something else is in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button, the imaging values will be automatically set depending on the values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Store as and store: with these buttons, the included values in the filesystem can be saved and later reloaded. this will be used the gp levels format.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three shades, the input values will automatically reinstall for all shadows, means and sun-tones. activate the color pipette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image for Rot-, green-, Blue and the Luminate channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The option overexposure indikator controls all colour channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only shown in preview and it's no effect at the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you can see an example of the alignment of the input from applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photos. intensity and Alpha Channel, as well as the extenders are unchanged. the original picture is marked with (1) and the corrected image with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left, half of the originals and the target image will appear. the preview is updated dynamically depending on your settings. on the right, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modification channel: this file box allows the channel to be changed from the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">Besides this casket there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a logarithmic view. for pictures that were recorded with a digital camera, the linear mode creates a wide range of beams. in this case the logarithmic mode will help.</seg>
<seg id="435">If you move for example a short panel to the right, for example the bright sounds, then you can see that these bright tones with dark fgaze will begin and the permeable pixel are darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">By preview the original photos is a red marker to see. if you want to change this markings on the section you want to change is a suitable line on the curve that represents the original value. create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is according to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and store: with these buttons you can make exactly this. each bend that you have created with it in the file system saved and later loaded. the file format is the Gimp curator format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you make this method and the three colour shades automatically create the checkpoints of curve for all channels of shadow, middle and solar-tones. enable the color pipette you want to use and click on the original picture to set the control points for the red, green, blue, and louminate curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The option overexposure indikator controls all color channels to overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel overloaded pixels, you get the combined effect displayed. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only shown in preview and it's no effect at the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black-white photo that was corrected in the Luminanzkanal. Schatten- and Sundays was used with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original picture is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel mixer of the & digitization; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color shades of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the shades of images. you can edit it from the menu colours channel mixer of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel optionally you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first note how to preview the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash. the left area of the window shows you a preview. the original can be viewed as compared to your own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The thumbnail of the target group has a red marker. if you can position this in the picture a vertical line in the histogram to show you the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are right down: regulator for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels. if you also enable general brightness, as the channel mixer then DAS tools to generate great black-white conversions of your photos. try the Grüncanal for black-white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix monochrome, the reduction of one color leads to a visible noise, which occurs from the color tree, which does not appear in the same place in colour. if that is the case, you can improve your monochrome conversion in which you will reduce the color first.</seg>
<seg id="447">The storing as and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any Mixer setting can save you for later and then load. the used file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The option overexposure indikator controls all colour channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only shown in preview and it's no effect at the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been reacted. the option Luminate is activated. the original picture is below (1) and the edited picture under (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / W photo has always been fascinating because of your abstraction. with the development of digital photography. with the development of digital photography, as colors can be converted easily on the machine. also with a set of film-roll profile.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford PP5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white filtration filter with a green light filter. this looks good at all scenimages and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky. thus, similar to the 004 Cokin (tm) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange-filmed: simulates a black / white filtration filter with a orous Linsenfilter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and air photos. thus, similar to the 002 Cokin (tm) orange-filmed.</seg>
<seg id="454">Rotary filter: simulates a black / white filtration filter with a red light filter. this creates dramatic ascents and can simulate moonlight of time-time. thus, like the 003 Cokin (tm) rotor.</seg>
<seg id="455">Joint-filter: simulates a black / white filtering filter with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural colour toner and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) yellow-filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: creates warm bright and medium-tones as it adds a bit coldness in the shattacking of a pressure and the redevelopment in a Sepiatoner. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 Cokin (tm) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">The & digitising; tool texture allows you to apply decorative textures to an image.</seg>
<seg id="458">Through adding a text to your picture, regardless of whether it is a color picture or not, you can look it like an oil painting, a pop-portrait on a wall. the menu entry into image processing can be used for this.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: move this parameter to the right increases the semblance of the depth and three-dimensional texture on the image.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper TextureTool has been applied to the photo below. the original balance is (1) and this changed under (2). the parameter Relief was set on 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">The & digicame; tool framework can add a decorative frame to add an image.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task. a way to keep his attention is to put the picture a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier to the aspiring eye. under picture frame, the module can be started from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter, you set the desired cream type for your picture. in detail the picture with a coloured line, Niepce surrounds it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black-white pictures), Absolete it with a cute three-dimensional frame of the ideal for a button resistant and decorative adds a decorative frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: displays the width of the frame in percent. the value means for the width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The target icon will be larger than the original, but the same aspect ratio. this is important for the pressure of the pictures, especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this handy tool, you can easily create a formatted text in a picture at any point. this also goes to several places when you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply enter the text and place it with your mouse. use Texture, orientation, color from the color tree and the character size. the larger the image, the larger must be the character. at the end, simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi-transparent background. already the picture is finished.</seg>
<seg id="468">Each setting which you have chosen for your text can be altered until you click the button "OK. after the picture was recorded, the text is part of the picture. it can no longer be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">The & digizer; tool allows to apply a template to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The menu image template in the image processing can be used to put in touch of a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template, there are no restrictions on the size and orientation. however, you need to add the PNG format and should work with maximum compression (9) for the reduction of file size of the template, so just send an e-mail in English to the & digib; Mailinglist digitised-users @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you have to put your Schablas folder with the button base folder in dialog. select here the folder in the you will be copied for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder for the Tattoo Stencils appears a building intelligence that reflects the folder structure of the Schablas. the selection of a folder will be updated the preview below automatically.</seg>
<seg id="474">Under the Preview you will find three buttons with which you can change the magnifier and adjust the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button increases the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Reduction: this button push the below image. it is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template to the whole image, you need to crush the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move this button to move the image below using the template. take this image and place it at the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to apply the template to your image. the image will then be automatically adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digicame; provides three different tool for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but, especially in dark areas, granular images.</seg>
<seg id="481">Unsharpest mask is working on the contrast of the edges to make a picture tougher look. actually, it's not a bit it works rather psychovisuell. you can use it to remove atmospheric Dark Dunst and it makes here a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and he is protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocussing is perhaps the best of the three because he really improves sharpness. he is a little more complicated in his application and has various parameters to adapt.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus and most digitised pictures need a correction of the sharpness. this is in this case that the digitalisation process can be combined with only minimal differences. the same phenomenon can be observed if color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras usually need more retroactively sharpening as normal cameras for private user.</seg>
<seg id="484">At JPEG-images is often applied for a camera internal sharpening. images in the raw format, they must always be stained during the processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanner address a shark microphone already during the reading of the image. if you disable this, you get the control of your picture.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can obtain such results by using a photo with the sharpening value breakdown. this allows you to view using the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="487">You should hereby deal with caution because the results are not very natural: the sharpness increases the edge of the edges, but reinforces the crafting technique for sharpening an image the tool refocussing. on refocussing you can find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: one image is a snack. the solution, the image is a little soft to draw, is much easier than it to sharpen. use the tool for softness using the menu entry settings and experiment with settings. the push pattern on the right of the dialog box shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter blurred is a very good tool to remove grinding from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The originals and the thumbnails will help the picture to edit. this display shows the edition of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the standard values produce frequently good results and should first be tried, increasing the radius or amount amplify the effect. if you make the insharpest mask, become smoking and the impression of grats near sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius poses an how many pixels on each side of a cante are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii. therefore, you should keep pictures best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the wiped picture one of the original is added. thus, the strength of the loop is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The tail value is a break from the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount. one can thus define a minimum difference in order for a cante of filters. in this way, these areas are avoided with a soft shift between the tones and hence beauty-error in faces, Heavens and water surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the blurred masketed filter. the original image is the (1) and the worked picture the (2). blurred, was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a swelling = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digitiled; tool refocussed a picture by improving the sharpness. it used to be protected by copyright-protected unfolding filter by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries to move a picture of & quot; refocussed; in which it is a technology called FIR Wiener Filters. he often uses better results than unsharp scalp. you can start it from the menu by calling colors refocussing on the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice the circular saver works far better than the Gauß's Faltung. the Gauß's Faltung are a very long tail, which leads to the mathematical results from the source pixel depending on the original score. it is even very strongly influenced by the distant pixels. it causes unwanted results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular dwellings: this is the radius of the circular condition. it is the main parameter for the use of this module. for most photos, the default value should put 1 good results if your image should be very blurred, but should respect it at Heiligenscheine.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help artifacts. the correlation can be chosen from 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0,95 and Chain. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpending effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Smoking-filter: an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce artifacts. however, values higher than 0.1 but rarely is helpful. if the noise filter is too low, & eg; 0 the image quality is very bad. a usable value is 0.03. a high value will be the image even further smiling.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauß 'sche sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauß's sharpness. use these parameters when your insharpest Gauß' is. in most cases, you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts, so you might also need to increase the correlation and / odertweak filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformation atrix. an increase in the size of the size atrix may have chosen good results, especially if you choose great values for the circular sharpness or the Gauß 's sharpness. in most cases, you should choose great value for these parameters. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">Storing as and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any number of refocussing parameters that you have set will be stored for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try all feeds, shades and intensity corrections in the picture before you use the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before you modify the image otherwise. the reason for this is that lots of operations the changes not immediately visible are left out, but later left unpleasant artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you read pictures and compress, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, blurred masking produces better results than sharpening. this could be causing this blurred masking a bigger neighborhood as a sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically, blurred masking always must produce artefacts. even under optimal conditions it can never be the effect of injected filters. practically the result of the FIR Vienna Filters is always at least as good as the Unsharpened mask. the FIR Wiener Filter is often better in treating small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between different filters on a small unfocused picture:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp color pattern that must be corrected. this picture was done with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the auto-focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the methods of shareholder structure in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English at this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The regulator smoothes the dissharpness of the area was drafted, in order to generate a natural Pupille.</seg>
<seg id="514">The hedge allows a suitable color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, then you can adjust this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool pictorial refracture is one of the most advanced tool in order to remove unwanted artifacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inner algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS Labors in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool includes various presets as a Starpoints to simplify the restoration. the available presets are below enumerated:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to use the filtering settings, you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detailed secrecy [0, 100]: this controls the maintenance of the details. a small value leads to a equal smoothing over the picture. Woagainst bigger values mainly be homogeneous regions and details. a value of 0.9 should receive details so that no sharpening should be downright. please note that the details of detail should always be subordinated.</seg>
<seg id="520">Straightening dependence Alpha [0.100]: a small value smoothes in all directions, while a value is close to 1 only in one direction, or CCD Rauges will produce a high value wave-like patterns. JPEG artifacts are best at a value in the vicinity of 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smoothes [0, 500]: this sets the maximum gluctionfactor regarding alles. p defines the relative smoothing. put this value therefore suitable to the degree of smoking in your picture.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter involves bigger structures. the higher this value is determined, the more is smoothed, as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a van Gogh's turmoil effects he must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: can be passed on as often the algorithm. usually reaches here 1 or 2.</seg>
<seg id="524">Protracite page da [5, 90]: angular-based integration of the anisotropen Alpha. if Alpha is small chosen, it should also be chosen as a small running time. so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral stepwidth [0,1, 10]: integral part-page in pixels. you should set the value of small 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never bigger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear interpolation use: the more quality you get through the selection of this option is only small. it doubles, but the running time. we therefore recommend it to release it.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons Save as and loading accurately this. any adjustment of image errors can be saved into a text file and later reloaded again.</seg>
<seg id="528">Image errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can still take very long and take a high CPU load. you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button breakdown.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how picks with Small artefacts are corrected. as you see, there is a peculiar black artifact that caused by poor movies during the trip is wurdel.The original picture is below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digitiled; robbery-reduction is a very powerful tool to lessen image-smoking. it uses a protected algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool represents selectable image filters available to remove spots and other artefacts, e.g. by dust or hair on the lens, remove. it can also be used to remove sensory from the camera or Moides; -effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about Sensorrauschen from digital cameras, so you can read them in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot up indicates a typical scene that was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grassy ledge that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">The following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the lower advanced settings can remain with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) up to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. high values increase the time required by the filter per pixel and can observe the image. the time is moved by the image and the colour in it becomes loveled and therefore smaller mistakes were cleared.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpening level. this value is set to determine the difference between the filter to the front and to determine lightest changes. you may need to change the edges-filter, if you change this setting. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter details do not get more and ruffing or blacksmith begins again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the watchings for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong can not be removed all the noise or crafads can occur. put it on a value near the maximum, if you want to remove a vigilant or JPEG-artefacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Light density: controls the luminance of the image. we recommend you either paint or luminance to change in order to improve a picture. these settings do not influence the smoothing process, controlled by the details -Settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Colour: controls the color-tolerance of the image. we recommend either color or luminance to change in order to improve a picture. these settings do not influence the smoothing process, controlled by the details -Settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the Gammatolance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance levels of the dark areas, which typically smokes are stronger, although he also merge the shadow's divisions.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the adaptying of the phasnobles. this value is defined as quickly the adaptive filter radius reacted upon variations of luminous resistance. if it is lifted up, the edges may occur. if he can occur at his minimum, can remove smoke and phasenjitter to the edges. he can remove buck tips and is the recommended method for it.</seg>
<seg id="542">Saving below and loading: these buttons are used precisely for that. all parameters for smoking reduction that you have set can be stored in the filesystem and later loaded.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how smoking the reduction can change your life. the original picture is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2). the smoking reduction was applied with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes an image is a naked for your purpose. the solution to paint the image a little soft is fortunately much easier than one image to sharpen. use this tool for softness using the menu entry and experiment with the smoothing. the proudder on the right of the dialog displays the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digitization: photo Restauration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of undesirable artefacts of your pictures. he is very well adapted to meet Gauß 'sches Rauschen, Kompressionartefacts and local mistakes which occurs in digital, original or subsequent digitised pictures. the smoothing takes place along the image contours and thus gets the content as it does the human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for color and text release. the text message is performed with another tool, the pictorial refracture, performed by the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS Labors in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the CImg Project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG Artefacts reduce: the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far from it. as a missed compressor & quot; artefaktequot; - small standards that are shown in the uncompressed picture. this setting is meant to correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons Save as and load exactly this. every setting of photo restoration can be saved into a text file and later reloaded again.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. but it can still take very long and take a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can see how to reduce a photo with a like-like roughs.. The module is applied to a black and white photo that with a Minolta (tm) HP-5 films with an sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the coated film granularity on the faces. the original picture is below (1) and the corrected one under (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time, textures have been reduced to an old colour photo, which was created with a scanner. you can see the scan artifacts that were caused by scannerlighting and photo paper. the original picture is below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digitization; tool Hotmerge allows hotes from photos showing with a CCD camera gem, eight were removed. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project which are protected by Martin Dickens.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, total or hot pixel are especially in high-quality raw mode photos a problem, as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built-in repression of hot pixel.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixel _ quot; and "quot; bright Pixelquot; in a photo with a dark image method. there are currently no manual method to select the bad pixel.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file into the wizard with the button dark picture. the tool will automatically identify the hot and bright image. these are highlighted in the picture show.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it is important to have the dark picture directly connected to discover new hot or bright pixels by CCD faults.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should find the matching dark picture to the corrected image. please note that the wizard will notice the last dark picture and this automatically loads in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and the preview will help you correct the results within the image. the preview of the filter shows the output of the filter with the current settings. bad pixel are emphasised in all occurrences.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area around the defective pixels on the thumbnails and the outcomes of the filter. select afterwards the best filter method to polishing these pixel blocks. these are the available filters:</seg>
<seg id="561">During: it is determined an average of the neighbour's values. the resulting color is assigned to all defective Pixels on the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation this is made separately for horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block, will be pulled to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-DIM) or a group of linearas curves (1-DIM) or a group of linear pixels in block to interpolishing.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filtermethod. all the pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are moved to a bi-square surface (2-DIM) or a group of square curves (1-DIM), which is then used to interpolishing the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all the pixels with a distance of 3 or less are moved to a bi-kubian surface (2-DIM) or a group of spherical curves (1-DIM) that is used to interpolish the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the pixel correction on a color photo, from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure, applied. the original picture was increased to 300% (1) and the corrected image is below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digitised; Vignalletizing Correction is a tool to correct the Vignetort, i.e. undergoing corner, an image to correct.</seg>
<seg id="567">WeitwinCeltic objective, especially the middle and large photographic format, can frequently illuminate the entire sensory area. instead & quot; vignetedquot; (shaded) they can reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light to the sensor there. Teleobjective may also appear this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">But he also has disadvantages. many centers filters require a factor 1.5 or 2 at the flash filter, which is impossible to keep the camera with the hand. WeitwinCeltic objective should also use the center filter, an opening of f / 16 or small, as otherwise indefeceffects may arise through motion.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the big exposures of today's film and color-scanner, it is possible to simulate the effect of a centerpiece by means of an equivalent transformation in a raw image which is used without these filters. the tool Vignalletizing is applied to a picture on. the algorithm is protected by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three controllers you can control the Vignalletizing and three other exposures of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of luminous absorption at the point of the biggest density filter. the default is 2,0, resulting in a optical filter with a blip adjustment of 2, decomfy .Increase the density to compensate a bigger degree of vigor, reduce it to compensate for a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Light intensity, contrast and gamma Settings: the editing of an image with the Vigntizing Correction reduces the luminosity of the pixels. they must reproduce the exposure of the target with these options. the regulator present you only positive values as you need to raise the settings just.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a finer refine of the target images, so let the values for illuminating / contrast / gamma at zero and use the Gradation from the menu color Gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the vitizing Correction that is applied to a picture. the original balance (1) shows the corrective image in the corners and (2) the corrected image. a leuchurke- and contrast correction was also carried out in the image with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digitization; Linsenverzerron is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a protected by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. colored distortions may not be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second Grades treated the general geometric distortion of the lens, and can correct the concave or convex form of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third Grades has a similar analysis, but flat on the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient fourth grades corrected the remote corners opposite to the second Grades. if you combine these two can be eliminated every geometric distortion.</seg>
<seg id="580">Generally: this value controls the strength of the distortion second Grades. with negative values may be corrected with negative formations, and positive values cranged distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of the distortion of the grades. this value acts stronger at the edges as in the center of the picture. for most lenses the 'corners parameters has the' corners parameter to the parameters of the parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value will be scaled the image size and thereby leads to the correction first Grades through. negative values enlarge while positive the picture is reduced.</seg>
<seg id="583">Bright: this value distinguishes the brightness in the corners of the picture. negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values they increase.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filtering settings, illustrated the dialog with a preview the distorrection correction. the values that you use for your picture will be saved and used as default values.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tonnel or cold correction should be performed in front of all of the cutting or size changes. best perform this correction as of all the first. in case you are able to cut an image and then perform a tonnal correction would be the effect of falsehood.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction is available to show you this tool a vertical and a horizontal locking system. move it to an important place, such as the sea side or a building wall, in your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. afterwards, you can correct the tonnel / kissenales with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a kicky branding, the resulting picture will have black nooks. you can transform them with the cutting tool in the menu, cut out of the image processing or about the zoom Regler of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">For most pictures the tonnal correction is sufficient. the next logical step for some motifs like e.g. recordings from the front, frame and paintings, it is the perspective so correcting the all angles in the picture 90 degrees. note that when you hold the camera with the hand you will always have a slight distortion of perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the tonnal correction applied to a church in Norway. the original picture is below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method for simulating infrared film of the GimpGuru.org web page which is accessible in this URL. the filter reproduced the known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfrarotfilm, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the thumbnail you can see two parameters set by filming and sensitive sensitivity (ISO). the ISO regulator changes the quantity of cutters and the dominance of the color green (chlorophyll in nature) in the conversion. green meadows are white as snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter color channels for reproduce infrared film misses, especially the green-channel makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos, as the color informations are missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of infrared filtering applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original picture is below (1) and the edited picture under (2). the sensitivity of the movie was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values produce a kind of aura in the main field.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digitised; filter filgritt is a simple to reproduce film gritt on your images, such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X, known. to increase the sensitivity of movies, the manufacturers mix large silver granules of photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film granularity gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past. in case you want this special, Galerie-like, rhinocular, granular sight especially in your monochromen photos, so you have to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the controller, the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although frequently higher values are required to be adjusted to ISO-2400. if you need even more grains, you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film granules of a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and working the (2). the original image used corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digitization; filter oil paintings produced the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digitization: filter oil paintings gives your digital pictures a nice appearance as an oil painting. natural images and still life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two regulators to influence this effect. the upper vote the brush size between one and five out of. thicker brush are suitable for big images. smoothes, smoothes or, from the other side viewed, the hinge.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting. the original one is marked with the (1) and working with the (2). Brush size for this 640 pixels big picture is 1 and smoothing 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digitising; filter coal-drawing uses colouring and intensory graves to create an coal telescoping. the lines that outlines the outlines in the drawing are stresses. images of their gradient function are therefore not ideal for this effect. it's helpful if you would like to imagine, which scene you would have chosen to catch you. this would be good pictures to start with it.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two regulators with a value-ranging from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper shelf is selects the foundations and the lower jusite the contrast (smoothing).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the classification filter. the original image (1) and the modified image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be improved by adaptation of the intending value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digitised; filter engraving your image in 3-D, as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyrighted algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digious; filter engraving is a fast tool to retire your pictures with a 3-D effect. he works particularly well with pictures with a simple structure where color is not the most important in the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to turn the image into a grey, mored landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows the contrast of the filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the edited picture (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filtering, you can transform a normal photo into a artwork by means of distort sewer systems. it uses the protected algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave-blocks 1: divide the image into cells and makes it look like if it is considered by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave-blocks 2: analog to the shaft blocks 1 the picture is distorted here with another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects need long time to calculate and create a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filtering, you can transform a normal photo into a artwork by means of sharpest effects. it uses the protected algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Unsharper: consume the image along a star-shaped lines that goes from one centre. this simulates the insharpness a zooming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of often in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial Unsharpness: impressing the image by rotation of the pixels by a center. this simulates the dissharpness of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Removal: the image around the effect of a non-focussed camera lens. the object appears to come back in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Movement for movement: consume the image through horizontal motion of pixels. this simulates the insharpness of a linear movements, z: B: from a car or train photographing, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Smoothing insharpness: wipes the image softened in the dark and strong in the light tones. this is ideal to create romantic Portraits (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic Portraits, Glamour-photos or to adding a warm and subtle bulbs.</seg>
<seg id="620">Sharpening hardness: impressing the image by random shift of pixels and simulates the dissharpness of a random moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent Unsharpness: finds the color-basins in the picture and consume them without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: shares the photo in rectangular cells and then creates it, through the colt with an average pixel value, new.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects need long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="624">The Regentrop are a cute little tool to make regentrop on your image. thus, it gives natural your images a nice appearance. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn by protected algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Dripping size allows it to change the size of the drips. since the dripping size doesn't automatically change with the size of the image it is often necessary the size for small images to decrease. number changes the optic effect of drops on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can hold with the & digitizer; editing a range free of regentrop. use the selection tool to choose the area, e.g. a face, which is free to stay free. if you start afterwards the filter regentrop, the area will remain free of regentrop.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of regulator Filters. the original picture (1) shows a quiet sunset and the edited picture (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can bring it by mirrors or rotating into the right orientation. the tools for this can be transformed into the menu and transforms mirrors.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo inflambles is definitely one of the most advanced tools in order to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">One image to crush is simple. the big question is, how can you rise in an image and see the details? how can you find the missing information again or guess? the CImg algorithm that is used here is a good work. try him and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size, you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. choose to change size in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog can be seen below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool to adjust the size uses a linear interpolation method to enlarge the pixels. if you want a small picture with a better quality, then try the tool to bublowing.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image processing programs use a type of interpolation, e.g. spine interpolation to enlarge a picture. & digitization; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS Labors in Caen / France and is part of the CImg Project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You must tell the tool how you want to change the size. these settings are available in the tab New size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">The aspect ratio is kept, when this setting is enabled, the new size of the original image is to be maintained.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter involves bigger structures. the higher this value is determined, the more it is difficult, as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a van Gogh's turmoil effects, it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The buttons Save as and loading are exactly used. each insertion for photo enlarge can be saved as text file and later reloaded again.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo blases is very fast at what it makes, but it can still take very long and take a high CPU load. you can cancel calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example for photo blbbles by adding a small display on the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged image (3). the preview (2) is the result of the linearas standard Augmentation, compared to the comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">The cutting of a photo is not only a common operation, but also a commonly underestimated tool to create a picture. the image processing allows you to create a photo with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and pull the rectangle, then you will see this rectangle while you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">If you leave the mouse button again, the area of the photos is cut off. this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after the cutting area. you can drag the size of the rectangle by clicking on the corners of the rectangle. you can simply drag the size of the rectangle by clicking it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cutting section, use the button The access button in the toolbar and the photo is tailored (Ctrl. + X). use the entries file Save or Save File to save the newly cut picture.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the precautions, you can change the size of the rectangle by postpone the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog remains intact.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the mold After crossings, you can specify the orientation as a vertical format or cross-format. in the high format, the larger value of height and width is assigned to the width.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool after aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimeters, Inch or any other physical size. you can see e.g. below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their side ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to select the selection automatically horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">Downward in dialog you can set by the Max. relationship to the section towards cutting, depending on the chosen relationship and orientation, set.</seg>
<seg id="648">The device's aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the orientation orientation (Horizontal or Vertical). if you use the cutting tool for the next time, these settings are stored as default values depending on the orientation. the changed image dimensions are displayed in the EXIF data sheets, so that the EXIF data are able to reflect the cropped image and not the originality.</seg>
<seg id="649">Help the interlocking assistance allows help to blends your images better. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonic particles are based on the principle of similarity. as the third-regiment, harmonic triangles are a possibility to share a rectangle in a similarly harmonic triangles on the diagonets.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden Center: the golden centre is a division of a different natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus pussy, or the flowering leaves of a sunflower. it emerges in all possible things to be found as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden partition is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it has already been used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks, making your temple and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden spacing in all times when you set your images, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number derived from Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 21, 21, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 21, the golden centre. a composition that this rule is regarded as visual harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden middle represents the liquid-discs underlines when you put an image together. these help are enumerated below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spiral will bring you to your goal good results for your photos. compared to the third-regel, the golden spiral lines will follow the eye through the image. this type of composition leads the view of the spectator along the line of spiral and creates in this way a symmetric visual river.</seg>
<seg id="656">A further rule are the justification of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. it should give something that the eye can be at the center of the composition. this can be a line or different objects. this something can simply be there without the eye, it will fulfill its task.</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golden triangles also lead from the above golden spiral. your vertices are the middle points of the pages of the golden triangles. note that in contrast to harmonic triangles, golden triangles are not synonymous triangles. diagonally to place these lines can be a static object dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use golden triangles in order to break up your frame create an effect of professional photographers dynamic symmetry. try to place your picture focus on one of the cutting points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you can't achieve.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options horizontally reflect and vertical mirror can be used to mirror the harmonic particles.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color you can set the color of the Help lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the auxiliary lines can be invisible. in this way you can adjust the color of the lines on your current picture.</seg>
<seg id="661">The free rotation is a tool to rotate a picture at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a photo, then it happens easily that you are the camera not exactly vertically or horizontal. this creates an image where things came around a angle. you can fix it with the & digitising; editing and the tool free rotation and jusate the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your image with the slider angle. the values on this slider are stated in degrees. with the knob default you can set the sliders again on 0 degrees. a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the picture are shown on the right top.</seg>
<seg id="664">To your help, the Module Free Rotation provides a horizontal and a vertical line available. move the mouse cursor to position the two lines, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now edit it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now jusks the angle as described in the previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">Once you have shot a picture you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. a way to fix it is the function transformating from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is the function macro-cut. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The option Anti-Aliasing is the image a bit after the rotation. please note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspektive transformations are performed by a fixture to the so called reference point. this point is represented in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares to the corners of your image. the preview is then automatically recomputed. on the right of the dialog box you will find some information which help you to change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: shows the width of the new image, including the empty zones that have been created by transformation in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: shows the height of the new image, including the empty zones that have emerged through the transformation in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle left at the top: displays the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed region.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle right at the top: displays the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transversed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left below: displays the current angle in degree at the lower left corner of the transformed region.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle right down: displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed region.</seg>
<seg id="676">After the adaptation of the perspective the picture will be a little disagreement. for a single adjustment this effect is small, but two adjustments produce a twice as strong effect and you should avoid it if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After which you got the perspective you get unhappy triangular holes in the corners. a way to regret it is the image to cut them out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The purpose tool is used to postpone part of the image into one direction and move the other part into the opposite. a horizontal pattern, the image will be distorted. in other words, a rectangle is turned into a Parallelogram. you can start this module via transformed shooting.</seg>
<seg id="679">Snap your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angles. you can press horizontally and vertically at the same time. if you press preferences, the angle is displayed on zero. a preview of the effects will show you and the new dimensions of target image are shown to the right of the preview area.</seg>
<seg id="680">To your help, a vertical and a horizontal line is hidden. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall of a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the tool-tool to remove your picture.</seg>
<seg id="681">After which you have carried out the shaft, the image will usually neglected. for a single welded this effect is usually negligible, but two scare compelling twice as much bluration and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After the shot the image has unbeautiful three-angular holes in the corners. a way to eliminate it is the image with transforming cutting from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digicame; needs a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. therefore, the available formats therefore depend on your system and, in some cases, of the way these libraries were compiliated. in most distributions you will edit a large number of image formats using & digitions.</seg>

<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographic localization is tools available to locate images geographically in the celestial coordination system, which is used by GPS and Galileo; height, longitude and latitude.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlated your pictures with geographic data you need a GPS track as XML-file in gpx-format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographical localization Korrelator. this interface can result in a number of previously selected pictures with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlated in the main window and call the menu. the top on visual dialogue will then be. to load a possible correlation over time and localization, you need to load a track file using GPX file. of course, this file contains exactly the same time at the same location, as the images of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">If the file is loaded, the automatic correlation is performed by the coordinates in red. GPS track data is recorded in GMT. this can be converted with the time zone. this can be done with the time zone. Set here your camera zone.</seg>
<seg id="815">The setting for maximum time deviation gives an upper deviation for the GPS Time and Camerabeit. lies the deviation below the data is gathered. the maximum value of this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you don't have a track of a place for pictures you can manually edit the gpx file and add to the images. the differing frequency of 2000 seconds will then mix all pictures in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolishing and differential in price can be used if you do not have appropriate data. if you know that in reality a LOKATION is located in a wide range of differing between camera and GPS, you can put this limits here and then push the button correlated to interpolishing.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful when you have taken a number of photos at the same place. as the dialog you need to use the coordinates of a call to the next notice, you only need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The LOKATION can also be found and set in line with the indicated region and enlarge it. select the appropriate region and enlarge it again, until you have reached an adequate accuracy. the card can always be chosen manually. the map can be changed between card mode, satellite image and a mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module, there are ways to hang the GPS data to the pictures. here is a small script that the exiftool is used to provide a stack of images with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI module image gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums into a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.01. you can select the albums that can be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set is co-8 to facilitate the best possible internationalisation.</seg>
<seg id="823">The module has four riders in which the settings can be adjusted. you only need to select all the albums that are exported to HTML. you only need to select a large number of albums. in the area below, you will quickly find a large number of albums. in the area, the Albenvorschau and the text of which appear in the head of the HTML page will appear.</seg>
<seg id="824">The rider's appearance defines the general look and layout for each side. this rider is largely explained. the option for each image created a site created in each image is displayed a new page displayed in the image. otherwise, the image will display directly with your default screen, & eg; Kuickshow, displayed</seg>
<seg id="825">The rider album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be saved with all your associated images. select a folder on which you have permission. a sub-folder containing the name KIPIXEExport which all contains, will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG file format, the EXIF-Bulletin will also be saved in the new images.</seg>
<seg id="827">With other color depth, you can change the standard color depth. of course, the file size is also influenced by all other settings themselves explained.</seg>
<seg id="828">The rider gageimages allow you to adjust some of the settings from the album rider for viewing images, these are small images that are displayed in the gallery to adjust.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window shows the user how far the action is. press breaking around the process to break down.</seg>
<seg id="830">When the module has created the pages, the window will not be closed automatically. you can therefore read the programs out to determine if error occurred during the generation. the web browser will automatically start at the end to view the preview of the gallery. click Connect to close the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI image reference is a very fast and flexible OpenGL based tool to view images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI Bildchter allowed him to look up a selection of pictures and perform on them base operations such as rotation, zoomes or relocating. the viewer can be used with short notice and prompt access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After the start, a picture is displayed by default in full screen mode. this can be changed into a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG-free module is a tool to change images without interfere with your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows for the actions below to save images in JPEG format without the usual loss of quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of the free storage is to increase the file size as no compression of color information takes place. this can be found even in PNG format.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI module Digitalkamera-Klient is a tool to connect your computer with a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module Digitalkamera-Klient has currently no documentation. if you are interested in writing these, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-Imaging @ kde.org. attention: the participants in this list speak English.</seg>

<seg id="840">With the import option of the metadata module, you can copy data from one image to another. select the picture that you want to copy in the main program and then select the image file. so you will then copy the image to which you want to copy the metadata. you will be copied by the button OK button.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but not in any target format. JPEG is supported in writing. please check out exiv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Kodierer module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG Kodierer module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video, with a defined length to convert. this module uses the packages of MjpegTools and ImageMagick. between the individual images you can add a audio file to the MP2 or WAV of the Diaschau.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images will be scaled to the correct size for the selected video format. in addition, you can select a background color for the slideshow. with this module it is possible to use formats DVD / XVCD / VCD for your DVD player. to burn the medium you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">You must first choose the pictures to be packed into the MPEG Diaschau. afterwards, you can create the module MPEG diaschau.</seg>
<seg id="846">The pictures selected by you are then listed under image files in the Portfolio. there you can also change the sorting of images or the content of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">Once you are satisfied with your list, you should customize the other settings. the video format can reproduce from different formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. PAL is prest and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step, you should indicate the time in seconds the one image is displayed among them. a low value creates very sudden, a high on the other very smooth image change.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in doubt you should let them black. the name and the path of the created file you can specify under name of the MPEG output file. keep in mind the extension mpg.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify a audio file under the name of the audio source file, this will start into the movie. depending on the button codes you can start creating the movie. depending on the speed of your computer you can get a drink quickly or in all the peace and enjoy the slideshow whenever you are back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a note appears that coders or tools are missing, you can adjust the paths to the programs of the MJpegTools and ImageMagick packages using the button below to the right below.</seg>
<seg id="852">The printer driver allows you to print multiple images on a piece of paper in standard Photosizes. the combined images can also automatically be opened using image processing Gimp. this is e.g: sensible to improve you or print with the Gimp module for direct printing.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module, you can import and convert your videos in one of three formats to JPEG, TIFF, or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command line tool dcraw by Dave coffin. an original zitat of Him is: expect from dcram not that it creates the same results like the software from your camera performers. sometimes you get better results with dcraw better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First, select the raw file to be converted, and start the module. the Raw image converter will then appear in mode for a single image. with the button preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now optimize the values new to optimize the convergence process. the first option is decides whether the camera settings can be used for the whiteways, brightness and red / blue amplifier. if the result is not optimal you can edit the picture later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected so you can use the contrast information. if your camera is working in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the output results. the filename remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossy algorithm and produces for it the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The tagged Image format, TIFF, maintains all the information of your image and uses the despatch-free LZW Compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you plan to process your pictures frequently or later, you should not select the JPEG format, as there is only a limited number of operations allowed before the image quality is worse. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you choose to select JPEG as a memory format, the metadata contained in the raw file are stored in the JPEG file in the exif information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adjusted your settings, you can start with the execute button. if you want to break this process again, you can cancel this process.</seg>
<seg id="863">The stackable mode allows you to convert different images to once. use this mode once you are safe, e.g. by gestures on a single image which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for individual pictures. however, however, you have the possibility to automatically overwrite existing file. however, one preview is not available. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images in an album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used for renaming of all images of a album. you can set the prefix that will be used to fix the number and timestamps.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a image collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can enlarge the image or enlarge four types of image change:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in a dimension. the width or height of the image is automatically selected, depending on the image orientation, selected. the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. here the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option for e.g. to customize your picture to the screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: not proportionate size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed at this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Pressure preparation: prepare the image for the photo print before. the user can adjust the pressure resolution and the size of the photo slideshow. the target image, including background size, edge size and background color, is adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected images to your preferred email address. it is also possible to change the size of the pictures prior to the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="873">Once you have started the module, the pictures window will display with the pictures selected. on the button pictures you can add or add a file selector with a file selector. for the last selected image, you will see a preview of the right.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag and drop images on the picture list and to add it to the list of the images below.</seg>
<seg id="875">"" "with the knob" "" "button pictures remove the selected images from the list of the images below." ""</seg>
<seg id="876">Once you have selected all the pictures you can open with the button OK the new message -window of your e-mail address. you just have to add the addresses and the header pages. the pictures selected are attached to you as an appendix.</seg>
<seg id="877">Do not pay attention to many pictures at one time. most e-mail accounts have limitations for the size of the send e-mails. it may be a good idea to send more mails when you want to send a lot of pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window will be used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration is saved and used each time until you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail clients from the menu. if you choose Thunderbird, then you will need to specify the correct path for your installation.</seg>

<seg id="881">Following the selection of comments in a hung file, the comments to the images will be put together into a text-file and attached the mail.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format below the menu images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted to free-free formats such as TIFF. you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast Internet connection and the photo quality is not to be changed. otherwise we recommend you to JPEG-format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG among images file format and the original files in the JPEG format are, then the original ecifdata will be added to the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="884">If the process is finished, the window will not automatically be closed so you can view the status messages, in search of errors, but your e-mail program will be started automatically at the end. with the knob button you can drop this window?</seg>
<seg id="885">Following the startup of the module advanced Diaschau appears a window with questions like you have shown your slideshow. you can choose between the selected and all images of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The OpenGL transitions in the presentation are activated very elegant captions by OpenGL. however, you need to have a corresponding graphics card, because otherwise it will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The filename option indicates that the filename of images in the lower left corner is displayed during the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The loop option ensures that the presentation will display in an end loop. you can manually draw it with Esc; abort.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option images accidentally choose that the pictures are displayed in a random order. so it will not be used the order of images in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">Below delay between pictures can be set up the temporal distance between the individual pictures. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect. so you should check this before presentation your friends!</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen survivors between which you can choose. randomly chose in any transition between the pictures another effect.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the slideshow you can access a toolbar on the upper left side of the roadside. move the mouse into this corner to turn off.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar you can stop the presentation and start again to start the previous and next picture and stop the slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="894">At the left bottom of the roadside you can see the current file names, the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module Time & Date juslen has currently no documentation. if you are interested in writing these, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-Imaging @ kde.org. attention: the participants in this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module background image is a tool to set an image as wallpaper for the workpiece.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module sets the currently selected image, depending on the select option of the submenu, as the background for your KDE workpiece.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have made your pictures and videos with editorial notes, you can see with & cphotoalbum; see picture. as you can see through a comparison with the picture, are now available in each group, so in persons, places and in the group of keywords.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window you see the categories, for which you have given information as you have given your pictures and videos with annotations. in addition, there are entries to look for EXIF-based information, which look at the folder structure on your hard drive and of course the current viewing images.</seg>
<seg id="900">When you press the mouse on the entry, the view is changing. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select another person, only the pictures are shown on which both persons are to be seen. through this choice, you can restrict the number of pictures shown by a few thousand pictures on a few more pictures.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all the people, places and other settings, you can view pictures to view the images of your efficiency.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture, each person has the same symbol in front of their name. you can save with & cphotoalbum; however, for each person a separate predator store, which is of course also applicable to places, keywords, and other categories you have defined yourself. see the picture.</seg>
<seg id="904">To view images in addition to the name, select the button, which you want to use on the right outside on the toolbar. it has the advantage that you can display for example symbols with images of individuals and at the same time a list of keywords (if you do not possess appropriate pictures).</seg>
<seg id="905">You must also specify which image is to be displayed for each individual person. in order to display this, you will need to view the picture inlet window. in the insured window, you can adjust the image factor according to your wishes and can choose which part of the picture is displayed or cut.</seg>
<seg id="906">If you enter the main window entry, you will see a dialog that is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties. this dialog can look at the picture once more.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string into the column or description, the complements or descriptions of the pictures are searching for this text, for example 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two data, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the lower part of the window you can browse all pictures following a specific name, as you can see in the picture. here, after pictures, on which jesper, but not Anne Helene are pictured.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user's manual for & kphotoalbum;. if you do not like to read manuals, but rather prefer functions, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & kphotoalbum; and have a look at the quickest, photos photos and the introducer videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & cphotoalbum; and select the demo version of the demo, if you start & kphotoalbum; start the first time, or select the menu Help menu on the first time, and you can try some example-pictures and you can try the functions of & kphotoalbum;</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, you will find it on the homepage of & kphotoalbum; as a personal HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & kphotoalbum; see the timeline. a picture of this bar looks here:. as the name suggests, this bar shows you data statistics about the images in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The timeline can show you several different types of time. each tab shows then a different unit. you can switch between the units, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you see a part of a database by stopping the bar only 10-minutes.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline you can use in the following ways: you can select the shown entries Preview from the database, you will see the first image of this date in preview (displayed) and also displays the timeline the current date of the currently shown pictures when you navigate in the preview view.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select a section of the timeline by pressing the mouse button and select the mouse over the ruler of the timeline, therefore the schedules, you will see in the preview view only pictures of this period. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a beam of timeline.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kphotoalbum; present you two options available to create HTML pages with your images, which is integrated in & cphotoalbum; and the other as a module is available (see). the following part of the user's manual is described in & kphotoalbum; the integrated version you can create over the Settings menu.</seg>
<seg id="918">Before HTML pages you need to make some settings. these are divided into the three areas content, layout and destination. in the following, each area is described more exactly.</seg>
<seg id="919">First enter the title of the title and a description that should contain HTML file later. on kphotoalbum; HTML-example, you can see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next select whether a & cphotoalbum; export-file is to be created on the overview page. nutritional information on export files can be found in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Finally, you can select which information on the HTML pages are to be displayed. for example, all pictures of a party are obvious. please note that & kphotoalbum; currently all pictures are exporting. you can not use this setting to hide certain pictures from particular attention.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this area you can specify how the HTML pages should look like. most settings options are unambiguous, which is why this is not specifically noted.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can adjust various resolutions for the images. therewith, those who have to view your website and possess a monitor that will have a maximum resolution 800x600, no images download for example a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewers of your site can change the resolution at any time. so, he can browse your pictures with low resolution, which leads to a lower transfer time, as if he wants to show an image larger, he moves to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this listing, insert the different folder and the URL where your site is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">The best select a base folder for all your HTML files and for each subsequent set a new subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="927">First, you have to select the main folder in which all your images will be saved. this folder will be saved and automatically added by the next time. here you can select either a folder or one of KDE supported protocol for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">Once you have created your pictures, you can check if this really all is visible for viewers. if you select a URL for the basic folder after the pages were created, the URL you set here should be this folder. otherwise, the web browser will launch in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the files created by you are not yet in the final target folder, you will need to manually copy them there. so the import function, behold, correctly you need to specify the final goal of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the basic folder in which all subfolders are.</seg>
<seg id="930">The only described settings can be referred to all three on basic folders or URLs. in these, a subfolder, whose name will set you in output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you're on a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, together with other users of & kphotoalbum; however, you might want to create a HTML page for viewing the pictures. however, if you write a lot of time for viewing the images, reception, etc., then you have to do with & kphotoalbum; this work is not even possible.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kphotoalbum; you can export a copy of your images into a .kim file. these can import others to your database. the image properties are imported with ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they are in the file, whether the images are stored on the file or if the file is saved into the file. the benefit of all images in the file is set aside. however, the obvious downside is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can either create a .kim File either directly from the menu File Exporting... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim File together with a HTML file, this will be an external .kim File.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim -file searches the images in two-fold way. first, the corresponding pictures are not found, so the images of the URL that you have entered in the folder of HTML files. this is of course only possible if you have created your .kim file using HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, dialogue will be described for the export of pictures, which you can access the File exporting process.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog box is whether it is to act by internal or external .kim files. the following three choices are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">At the option Manual in the vicinity of the .kim file, you need to copy the images in the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the option Automatisch in the vicinity of the .kim-file copy and kphotoalbum; the pictures automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. as most pictures already were compressed with JPEG, and the XML file itself is very small, it's usually not worth the files to compress. if you like this, just select the option export file compressing.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page reads Maximum image size limit. if you want to send your friends photos, you might not want to send the images in full size because the .kim File otherwise would be very big. here you can tell the size by saying that each image is at most 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the Settings menu, you will import & kphotoalbum; the exported database as described in.</seg>
<seg id="943">The wizard for Importing consists of four steps. first, you need to select which images you want to import, then to which folder will import images to be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It can be that you personalize the category of persons who is imported into the category (if you are a domain name) while this category is in the third dialogue window, which categories that are imported into the file and which categories that are imported into your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step you can import the categories of the imported file using the categories of your current database. an example for this can be seen on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It has to be easy to browse images and watch: when you see images, you would like to see photos of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your boyfriend, you might want to see all the images on which this friend is pictured.</seg>
<seg id="947">This manual contains the various steps of (1) Creating the information about your pictures, via (2) the passage and view, to (3) advanced themes and adaptability to work.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoalbum was started as a program for managing your pictures. but it has been extended and today it also takes care of your videos. in many places in this manual are spoken about pictures, but frequently, this also includes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kphotoalbum; saves all its information in the file inde.xml in the top folder of their images. this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice, e.g. normal locking tools, copying them on a floppy disk or revisions at CVS, where they would like.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kphotoalbum; renotes the folder where your pictures are saved and used this at future Starts. if you want to read another database in & kphotoalbum; so you can start another folder of folder with images, you can start the -c. as example: kphotoalbum -c ~ / Company / Images / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Via the menu entry settings kphotoalbum; set up a window with which you can change the settings of & kphotoalbum; the following section of the user's guide will be explained to you the different settings options.</seg>
<seg id="952">"" "links you can see six different symbols, with which you can access settings and options for the viewer. for each setting there is a detailed help you can access to the F1 key and select a click on the desired option." ""</seg>
<seg id="953">It was described as you describe for every picture of different properties, e.g. individuals, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups like items, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">To see the dialog, which is used to process existing groups. for each existing group you can choose a label and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section subcategories were already mentioned. in the dialog options you can set up all members of the members, e.g. all members of a group at once in a group organize than all groups of a medied as in explained.</seg>
<seg id="956">In view the settings options available to you are available for the fixed listing of the members. with the above listing list, you can select the category you want to configure. in the left pane, a list of the current category and in the right is a list of subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kphotoalbum; shares its modular system with other graphic applications such as digitised and Gwenview. this modular system is called KIPI and means & kde; Image Plugin Interface. nutrition information on this can be found on the homepage of Kipi.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be called by the menu modules. the modules can and will not be described in this manual since they are not part of & cphotoalbum; but are separately sold. most modules have a help page that you can access over the modules itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules can be used together with each other, it can be that the modules with & kphotoalbum; it should always be very little tested using the demo database before you use them on your own pictures. the demo database can either call on the command line with the command &gt; kphotoalbum -demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the menu Help. do not say I would not have warned!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use the modules regarding KIPI are very different, which means it may be that some modules with & kphotoalbum; not work. this is the disadvantage if you share functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & kphotoalbum; and other applications that also apply to KIPI, is that the other applications can not support their pictures in albums. even if & kphotoalbum; this kind of order does not support, simulates it for some modules the order by albums, so that you can use the functions with & kphotoalbum;</seg>
<seg id="962">This simulates & kphotoalbum; the current album, which simply corresponds to the current view, so all images that shows you the picture shows at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="963">In addition to the current album & kphotoalbum, the modules also has to be handed over a list of albums. here, & kphotoalbum; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & picphotoalbum; s browser displays the contents of a category, for example all persons, then each entry of this category represents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will have the category that you have set in dialog as a category for virtual albums. for example, if you want to use the category people, & kphotoalbum; so do you have chosen persons to the view and pass this on the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & kphotoalbum; not compatible can you remove them from the list of modules. start the dialog dialog and select the modules that you want to load modules.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a startimage screen as soon as you start your photo album; starting with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you're used to use it from any other KDE application, you will see quite a menu navigation - and a toolbar. at the moment, you will find no information about your pictures, then click on this window, then click on the entry image to show you an overview of all available images.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & kphotoalbum; is the possibility to see each image with annotations, where the image was recorded, etc. you can bet each image either individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time. if for example on all pictures is jesper pictured and all pictures were recorded in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these comments can be used for the Browse and browsing, as you can read in the section. if you want to see these notes if you are using the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">In view three lists of a text box by setting people, places and keywords, these are a very important part of & kphotoalbum; because you will always use them again when you enter information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is to push the pictures within the list: if you have a family party and have formed the same 5-10 persons on all 50 pictures, so that the names of the names are moved upwards to find the people faster and arrange.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to see a alphabetical list, click on the icon for sorting by date below the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected any comments on each picture individually, you might want to edit all the selected images and provide these images with annotations. simply click on the front and back buttons that are placed under the preview of the image to the right.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have multiple images, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more comfortable to mark all these images and to use the menu item multiple entries at one time with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California all lie in the USA. furthermore, San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you will see a browser window of the USA as an overgroup. to show you that it is an overgroup, a special symbol is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the comments dialogs, it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over- or subcategory. in addition, you can also create an entry into a category and lay down in order to do this one subcategory of this entry. caution, this presupposes that you just sort your categories alphabetically. see that.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the individual elements of the comments dialogs by form the bar, which form the upper edge of the frame, click and postpone. you can make a single window by selecting it outside the window range.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adapted the look of the window to your needs, you will be satisfied with the settings, click on the button options... which gives you the possibility to save the current setup and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also use a frame completely out. if you want to display this window later, use the button Options... and then window a / hide. this process can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you choose the display images in your browser, you get an overview with preview images of the currently selected pictures, or all pictures if you have no filter. you can configure the size of the thumbnails, by simply drag the mouse button with the middle mouse button. try it easily.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you drop a picture on the background of your desktop, this picture is decorated as wallpaper for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on an image, this displayed in the picture section. if you have not opened a window with a photograph, a new scorester will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete pictures in the picture list. simply select the appropriate images from which you want to delete, or select either the Edit button or select Edit menu. now you can see the window you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& kphotoalbum; offers you a solution for this problem. you can also use the pictures without which you have stored on the hard drive. of course you have to record the pictures anywhere, so that the images can be downloaded from the disk. in the picture you see the view from & kphotoalbum; if not all required images can be loaded from the hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="987">Pictures, in which the right upper corner is cut, are not stored on the hard disk. however, for example 5-9, however, the thumbnails are present, so that & kphotoalbum; however, you can view the preview of these images, however these pictures may not look at the image.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you can see, this feature does not need to copy files from folders and again. & kphotoalbum; it does not support you to avoid the insertion of the question. in case you do not want to avoid the penetration of your images, please buy a larger disk to store all images on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the menu images you will find a submenu with the name of privacy. if you want to have a little more privacy, please filter the images that you may want to unaccessible for others and click Apply View images, which may see your little sister, infeuvers and the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="990">This allows you to specify which images in case of the case should be hidden from your little sister, so you simply select the menu entry pictures, eliminating all the images that you're locked. if you want to see the pictures again, click Derre.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to specify a password that must be entered into the pictures to unlock the pictures. to adjust this password, simply select password in the menu of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please consider that this picture protection is not very safe at all. you can access all images on the hard disk and anyone who can access the file inde.xml, password as unencrypted text only serves to those who deal with & cphotoalbum; not very familiar to honor the view of private pictures.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason why you manage all your images with & kphotoalbum; and of course you want to spend hours over hours with it, of course, that you want to look at some sometime. for this reason it has a picture _ and video-viewed. this allows you to run out of preview, as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer can see in. it shows of course the picture, but extra any information you have to enter the image like e.g. who is on the picture, when and where it was done, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the Infobox on the upper part of the picture you want to see, you can also configure this easily with the mouse and elsewhere. all these options are shown at all. all these options are available after a right-click on the viewer. the following context menu allows you to see below.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the Infobox are underlined. if you click here, see the right items to display. if you click on Anne Helene, the browser shows you all pictures of Anne Helene. as if you had chosen persons from the browser and then Anne Hene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have loaded several pictures in the viewer, you can switch between them and go back by using the buttons picture high and picture. you can jump to the first and last picture with Possione and end. these features are also accessible from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If multiple images are loaded in the viewer, you can leave this as a slideshow. & kphotoalbum; then a new picture invites you by pressing the Ctrl key and Plus or minus. started and stopped the slideshow through the Ctrl key; S.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful ability of the beholder of & kphotoalbum; it is used in full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the complete place on the screen. simply use the entry button to switch in full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">When you use the viewer, you can move into the image and perform zooming. with the minus button you can rezoom into the middle of the picture. as a zoom button is checked in the middle of the picture and shows the result of the zoom.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point button you can reset your zoom, so that the image is not displayed as zoomed, so that each pixel is in the screen of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Notice that the only Zoomoperations are working in videos that are now in and zooming with the Plus- and Minukey.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the filming from the context menu you can rotate the image. this does not work with videos. you can make notes to the current picture with the menu item remarks from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you can see pictures it may happen, that you will find a picture with a person whose name you will have forgotten on the image. in the moment you can preview the interruption and configuration dialog of the picture to view this name. however, you'll perhaps prefer to mark the picture and view more images.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the images on paper. to see which photos you want to start the viewer with the images and select it as good or bad, while you look at one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above gives you the viewer to provide images with characteristics, while you look at them. characteristics are the letter A to Z and you can put a feature by pressing the corresponding letter. in view of the features A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have set features on your pictures, they are available in your browser. so you can see all the images you want to print, print or whatever you choose. afterwards, you can use a module to copy the selected images on a CD or what you just want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and particular features can be displayed in the preview view. if you add categories to the images, then you can press attributes to the pictures by clicking the letter for the feature, after the picture was selected. this can be seen here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. in this case you will be able to paint the photographs on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The tune will not be saved with the image but in the database. in the way you can move your gems later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In addition, you can see an image at the painted picture. in order to turn off the painting mode of & kphotoalbum; take off on the picture painting from the context menu. to finish the fire below, simply press the cross in the toolbar icon at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To work with & kpovmodeler; do not have to control the application of the program & Povray; not fully rule, but the documentation on & Povray; should you absolutely read and understood.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object of the object, you can select individual objects. then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object in the wire modell- views yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects simultaneously. but not the underobject of one already selected object, as all the objects already are selected using the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object in the Object of the Object, select the item you want to insert the object and either click on the icon in the toolbar or select a menu entry in the menu insertion.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are mehre possible positions, the following unfolding menu appears, so that you can choose the correct position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">With Deleting, either from the menu bar, using Edit or from the context menu of the right mouse button, you can select previously selected objects from the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changed features, click here to apply these changes. you have given invalid values, a message will be displayed with a description of the error, then click on the input errors and then click on the changes to break down.</seg>
<seg id="1019">When you enter the path to & Povray; user documentation in the dialog dialog, you can call the & Povray; reference to the indicated object with help.</seg>

<seg id="1022">Press the preview in the property view and a small example of the scene is hindered with the chosen text box. as default, the entire texture is selected, even if you want to rendering an element within a text map (for example, a text box within a text map) and not the entire texture map), cross local text.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screenshot shows the control points of the camera. you can drag these checkpoints with the mouse and thereby change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is elected, the checkpoints will disappear and there will be a small cross in the wirelocation view. this cross marks the centre of scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifts. you can change the shift by dragging with the mouse inside the entire window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a lens level of visibility. you can indicate this value relative to the visibility of the higher object or as absolute value. objects are only displayed when they are selected or their view of view of small or equal in the toolbar of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a user interface as presetting. the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you do not like the default window, or if you need another arrangement, you can save them any number. you can also save multiple windows regulations and easily change between different arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window above or under a present view, drag the start to the top or bottom of a view. a rectangle shows the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the start to the right or left side of a view. the new view is then anchored on the right or left side of this view and extends over the overall height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to arrange several views on each other, draw the start of water in the middle of another view. you can then switch between views by clicking on the carton-card above in the views.</seg>

<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene, you can rendering them. & kpovmodeler; uses & Povray; 3.1g for rendering, this program has to be correctly installed. this version was written in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0 is not supported.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To rendering the current scene, click on the icon renders The symbol renders in the toolbar or select the menu entry view scene rendering.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A Render mode corresponds to the entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and quality of rendering. if you want to insert a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can insert any number of Render Modi, from a fast preview up to full images in the highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the icon The Render settings in the toolbar or in the menu View Render Modi... select the following dialogue will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each Render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but it is a name that can be recognized the characteristics of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the box size, you can enter the width and height of the framed picture. if you want just to rendering a small area of the image, choose the belt area and give the picture-cut to renders into the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In combination with quality, you can select the properties that uses & Povray; for renders. this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diffuser reflection. a detailed description of the Render features can be found in the user's manual & Povray.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture is bordered with just one Straighten pixel, you can create various bugs. these images often have a moirè pattern or bowed effects in curves and lines, sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is called Aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">VPovray; uses a technique called Anti-Aliasing to reduce the influence of this error. generally, images are better seen using this property.</seg>
<seg id="1044">When you turn off the anti-aliasing, and connects & Povray; more than one ray of the pixels. this technique is called super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super-sampling is adapted to the neighboring pixels. the second method is adaptive-recursively; recursiv, because every Pixel is always separated, and adaptive because the record depth depends on the calculated colours.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method then POV-Ray one Strahl more pixels. if the difference between the colours to the neighboured pixels have been processed, then both pixels by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you calculate the low value of 4 then 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 beams per pixel. if the difference between the values passed the prevalent threshold, then the pixel are classified into 4 subpixel that are individually further monitored and checked for further subdivision. the maximum depth of the Rekursion can be set up with its lowest value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to decrease the Aliasing effect is the generation of smoking for the beam process, called jittering. if you turn on jittering, altered & Povray; the blasting for a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for quality of the renderns is diffuse Reflection. this is an experimental property of & Povray; the diffuse light reflection. it takes very long to be able to calculate a scene using this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map, you can specify whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixels is then transparent when the associated beams have no object to be made.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for displaying the & Povray. if & Povray is completed. if & Povray is finished, you can find the reason for this here.</seg>

<seg id="1066">Larger values result in an exact wicage model, and therefore a better approach for the indicated objects, but require more time to rendering. for some objects such as the ball, you can adjust the detailed instruction for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">When you cross the High Detailed view for advanced projections, all wirevisions are further divided, when the camera uses an extended projection. advanced projections are all projections with exceptions to the perspective and sensed projections. this property gives better approach for projections, but requires more time to rendering.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you see walls, a wall is rounded behind the objects. the wall is represented in a checker-board pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you crosses soil is displayed a floor below the objects. the floor is represented in a checker-board pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>

<seg id="1071">On this page you can change existing window arrangements or create new window arrangements. in the section window regulations, how you can create window orders and save it.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The Combinary Single-tolerances: displays all existing windows. & kpovmodeler; uses the selected window orders when starting the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of existing windows regulations shows all existing windows. a new arrangement may create you with the button Add and delete a selected arrangement with the button delta.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Each window rules will be identified by the name. the name must be clear and may not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list below shows all views of the selected window orders. new views can be deleted using the button Add and select selected views with the button delta.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with New column create a new column on the right side of the available windows, with box map you will receive a carton view together with the previous view and shutter that view not in the main window, but generates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you have just been installed & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you want to follow more precise knowledge of the two programs. if you follow all steps in this guide, you should create the ultimate blissant but simple scene, among beginners very popular: a sphere on a level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully consider the following warnings, before you complain that you will receive as a result only a black screen. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you are not set any camera, no rules can be applied to renders as a result you get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you want to insert no light sources, your entire scene is in the dark and you only get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have all faultless installed, you can see at the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following preset window order:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of the toolbar. read the documentation so you can expect a proper idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols frequently, so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, you must first remove all objects from the object-tree. highlight the scene and then select the menu entry. now you have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wireline view shows how the camera sees the whole scene that you generate. especially notice the scene from the point of view of the camera. this shows you the result of the renderns of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The Object Tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. if you click on it, you can find the content of the Object Objects, in which the various parameters of the camera can be found. in the user's documentation to & Povray you will find more details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Change nothing to the basic settings of the camera, this is later instructions reserved, but notice the camera in view checkpoints with which you can change the waypoint of the camera. just click with the left mouse button on a counter point and drag it to the desired place.</seg>
<seg id="1088">If you apply the button button or press the input button, the wire rope-views and the object-tree will immediately change according to these settings. as a result, they see the scene from the point of view of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the floor for the scene. you could for example insert a quader (inserting body quader) and the size on x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but that's a concise method for solving this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; actually offers an easy way. you can use an infinite level as a floor:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the level in the object-tree, change the name and then push the button button. the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wirelocation-view now also shows the level, although at the moment only the limited end level. if you rendering the scene, the level stretches up to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you view the object of the object, you will find that you click the entry for each new object: scaling, rotation, and shift. select one of these options, also change the possible settings in the view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should move the ground to exercise a unit among the skyline, just to get to know some of these parameters. select shift and set values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">Just choose the floor to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but choose something different at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases a dialog box can be inserted in which you can choose how the object is inserted. please choose the name in the object view (name = ground-pigment), with a click on the button previews, see how the pigment looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of pigments shows only a matt black material because you can still enter settings for pigments. do not think about the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview. do not give it many possibilities, but do you now take the simplest.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't see any color on jader and ball, just click the button below and then call the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the ground is now correct. if you rendering your picture by clicking on the icon, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, this will not be the color-. you have expected. here are some settings necessary. in the Farbenlist you have to enter two new attributes. then edit this entry twice (you can also do this same, but the chessboard color color can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">Select in the Object-tree each and change the colors in the view of the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">This step you should already perform just as you have understood the basic working method of & kpovmodeler; the ball is as easy as to create the ground:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object properties, you can instantly change the settings. put the value for the radius: on 1 (do not forget the input key or the button. otherwise the ball would stick over the ground, as you have moved the ground to move down a unit down.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, the renders now yield a strange result: as already before see before, the ball-surface appears like a matt black material. put in the following step one of an appropriate material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the ball, you can now find a material now. as already in the ground, give the ball a pigment as a color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select initial instruction and change the name for example in sphere Pigment. click the ball Pigment, select then colors and place the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can reach more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as shown in the following screenshots and click on or press Enter.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The attitudes strglow effect and rélexion result in some good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces, even if metal: not yet selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of what options offer you & kpovmodeler; and hopefully you have so much learned so that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracycing is a Render method to create a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene or model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">If you have a scene raytracen, shoots the renderer hypothetical rays from the perspective of the beholder (i.e. the scenes) describes how this beam through the objects is reflected and broken, the visual effects of light sources into the scene and how is atmospheric effects like for example fog. so the scene is processed for pixels.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you will see nothing without a camera, the camera is your eye, with which you see the scene. without a light source you also see nothing, the image is simply black. obviously needs every scene that should be leased, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog you can select your file. Povray files usually have the extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the standard file dialog you can select a file that you have created before with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file will be inserted in this sub-menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you already saved the model, it is stored under the same name. if it is a new file, you must enter a name and disk space.</seg>

<seg id="1125">A bump map is a way to smoked surfaces without any beats on the surface individually modelling and without change the geometric shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is customary to use the same file for both a Bump map as well as a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Fundamentals are simple geometrical forms that you can use as a building blocks: very complex 3D models are generated from dozens or even hundreds of this basic body. these models are then further processed to give them a realistic appearance.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to specify the surface of an object color on a pixel base, by using a picture file as a colour map.</seg>

<seg id="1188">With the help of DCOP you can control your scripts with amarok and Amarok. the easiest way is to use the command dcop; which should support each KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages enable the execute of external programs and commands. in this way, usually the function exec () can usually be called dcop &gt; relatively simple. here an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& Amarok; sends notifications to all running scripts. this is why scripts used to monitor their default input and respond accordingly to events. of course, a script can also ignore the events if there is no usage for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure the script to view the dialog dialog. to run the storing and loading of the insertion data, each script should take care of yourself. if a script is started, Amarok requires the working folder on the folder where all data should be saved.</seg>
<seg id="1192">Trackable signalizes that a new piece is played. the script should now ask for example; using DCOP functions to ask more information about the new piece (for example the metadata or the rod).</seg>

<seg id="1196">Amarascript administration may also install script packages that can be compressed for users. such packages are basically normal tar archive (.bz2), which can also be compressed with bzip2 (.bz2), so that the user can clearly determine the archive as a Amarok script package.</seg>

<seg id="1482">Opens the settings of & K3b; here you can make general programming-settings. almost all the functions of & K3b; should work on thhieb. this dialog is intended for personalizing and imagining of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& K3b; is how many other & cde; applications also equipped with a & DCOP; interface. with the help of this interface, parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP; functions to use, you can either use the command line utility mcop, or which are the somewhat more comfortable program Kdcop. both programs are identical in the functional start, so that's more your taste and the type of your task is critical by giving the denominator you denominator.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter we take note that you can use the Command program dcop. to use the & DCOP; to make sure you have previously made that & K3b; then enter something like the following on the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">In addition to the general & DCOP; functions, all & kde; program marked, supports & K3b; mainly two more parts described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP interface of & K3b; features functions such as copyCD, formatDVD and other features for creating new projects.</seg>

<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method, you will receive a DCOP reference to the newly created project: # K3b --audiocd and then generate a reference to the project using # dcop K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b Projectd project.</seg>

<seg id="1496">First, the titles of the & CD; read and saved in WAV files on the computer (verlustfreely and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step these WAV files (usually one per captions) compressed into the MP3- or OGG format, or in other formats such as the air-free FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD;, is used by & caudiovas; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this has not yet been installed, this has to be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other coders are already available, it is therefore very likely not necessary to compile something itself. however, only the co-erer is not necessary to compile it. if for example, FLAC is not used, its installation is not necessary.</seg>

<seg id="1512">This chapter describes audio quality, coding and compression rates and helps you in choosing the right code.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a lossfree audio format is required. beside FLAC there are also other like 'shorten' or 'Monkeys' that may possibly be available for this distribution. the downsides are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can reproduce those files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats, the information through data compression lose according to their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG can have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower Bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but on this bitrate the differences are less important as both coders produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'not so 'free, lame is still free with most distributions for free, but there are always open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high up to very high sound quality (at high bitrates), but compared to OGG slightly deeper quality at deeper bitrate.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or machine based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG files are present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music can also be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD player, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, disk) or special car stereo systems. today - initially 2009 - support these devices mostly only the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A brief list of parameters to the audio quality and the resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for other parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting results in good transparency for most persons and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually offer for most persons and most of the music pieces accepted to provide transparency and has quite high quality. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. takes up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate approximately 5.5. needs always 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a titles. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-H '= 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate ca. 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a titles. well-enough for music of youths, portable devices and car systems. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most individuals and most environments but if you absolutely want to have the absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that will be done manually or retrieved by the program automatically from the freeDB via the Internet, are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can be delivered with & kaudiovator; and the code file to generate the folder and file name as well as the characteristics of music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with co-programs, there is often a combination of programs for the coders and those parameters here. the manual or the help to the coders declare the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">E.g. around the & CD; title to the keywords (English: day) add when MP3s are coded with lame, the switch must be added by lame and the title parameter of & caudiovator; the result looks like this: '... wtt {gender}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & audio auditing; parameters that can be used (= button-designation in assistants):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freeDB is: a free database, where the people can download and enter the information, so that all the other information can be downloaded instead of yourself: & CD; title, artist, names of the pieces & etc., not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (Annaming of the Uebersee) am not attorney. however, no one can prevent from the & CD; learn more or less worthless, so can neither the artist nor the music-enterprise damage. all information can be added in a bummel through a & CD; shop, physical or virtualized.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiovator; is actively called a cross-lane (sending an address). for the use of freeDB may not be used with another (counterfeit) address than those in the system, the e-mail address is not used when retrieving the data from the server (This can only be the programmer who has checked the code).</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are many countries copies of the main database. if & caudiovator is set up; for the use of freeDB, the geographically located at the next mirror server is to be used. this saves bandwidth within the network and compares the burden between the bills.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a list of reflections for the online retrieval of & CD; information during the reading of a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) just the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which reading program is used to save pieces from the & CD; in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumors that cdparanoia is used; who wants to know more exactly the source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; see to note that the cdparanoia package has to be installed first if this has not yet been done.</seg>
<seg id="1537">For storing the WAV files can be chosen the Kodierer and thus the desired file format. at first opening there are pre-defined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a twisting free compression for audio data) on the tab. other coders can be added on this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The cooker package must be installed from the corresponding Linux distribution before the code can be used. this is also necessary for predefined coders. more information about Kodierer are located in the chapter Which coders.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a code, further information about his switch can be obtained through the input of a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a consolete window (eg; console). it must be replaced by the name of the installed Kodiers.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the device of device recording of & CD; / DVD drives, the writing and readers of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, FLAC & etc;) are installed. try both programs with a command line in a terminal. that could give an indication of what is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you do not want to read a copy-protected audio CD; check out the sleeve of & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with one step by step example. even if you use other settings, these tips can give you how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, everything understood, but somehow is still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information about doing those areas that you want to do exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will launch the program for the first time, all set up and read our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3v1 keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">It must be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be found as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can be found for example with a search engine, as it is not necessary to compile source files, which you can of course always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you own screaming it (eg; by trying to do something in the context of the queror).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic set of & audio auditing; something which is likely to be done once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes how to read the procedure for reading a & CD, what needs to be repeated and to be repeated.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the cooker for the compression of the music (lame) as well as the resulting audio quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). as we are lazy, we divide the program to use the freeDB to download the & CD; data from the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will be very likely not to change with each output of a & CD. change once the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device-drawing is transferred to the reader program so that it can read the & CD; -data / pieces read.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the real device-drawing of your drive. if this is not working or when more than a & CD; / DVD Drive can also be accessed, allowing a view to the file / etc / fstab and an attempt using the available entries for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The carton card General settings. here there is not much to do. here, an additional conversion is defined. in our example everything will be displayed as soon as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only in case of complete information please select so you will be informed when information on the testify of keywords (tags) are missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The map card CD; -Settings. just select both entries. we are comfortable and let the & CD. data automatically download via the Internet from an freeDB machine.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected during reading the & CD; connected to the Internet so that he can access the freeDB server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection field is simpler, a & CD; entry found immediately starts the reading of & CD; which is later unhappy with the database entry and the file name / filename or file name, they can easily change. the directory or filename will be changed with Konqueror- &gt; rename and the ID3-tags with Kid3, the & kde; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, if you want to manually enter all the selection areas and freeDB is not used. however, this about 620 MB large, consider this twice if this is worth it. to be selected to freeDB in the offset emodus, the two choices must be selected at least the first. the mode is set up on the following map-card.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is for us freeDB. these are settings for the data-request, for retrieval the & CD; information from freeDB-server on the Internet. how does the system know which data is to get the CD? read the section about freeDB. put everything as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we have not downloaded the database, we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB-server: please go to the site freedb.org and look for a mirror server near you. on this way the burden will be distributed among the bills. however, this setting will work as a first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both function similarly to the server, but many firewalls can boast the protocol 8880 by default, perhaps more luck with the protocol 80, since the & HTTP; protocol is usually open to surf the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example we do not want to submit a & CD to the freeDB server. the first authentication should be dissolved.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Just take over the settings of the screenshot. (make sure the folder / tmp is existed on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">At the same time incoming pieces, sorry, there is a reason why more than one at the same time in just an existing drive? parallels reading and coding? the author does not know it, therefore just try.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after reading the last piece of pieces, you cross this to release the & CD; at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">User-defined folder for temporary files: when you cross this file, then / must be specified the path / folder where the WAV files are stored, the files in the private folder will not be created. forget this folder if you want to make something with the WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">All the same as it is shown on the screenshot. the command is somewhat long, under circumstances something must be turned on to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as previously mentioned, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good HiFi stereo systems. the resulting plate factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and storage.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for the restriction of tags to version V1 / V1.1.' ID3v2 'tag can also be deleted if required. Kid3 is an excellent' id3 'Tagger for & kde; in case of later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Continue the rest as shown in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">The number of WAV files: with dual Core or Quadcore or even a multi-processor machine can be tried to encode more than one WAV file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">This is it, we have just finished the basic setup of & audio auditing; this configuration is used as standard for each output of a & CD; if you have chosen the organisational structure of your music, you never need to change them again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section, described how the process of reading the & CD; on the hard disk the folder structure, the way the music is organized on the hard disk, as we are comfortable and the & CD; data from the freeDB shall be described. the process of which is described in this section, must be repeated for any outgoing & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD, which is not yet available in freeDB, the screenshots are a little different from the data for a & CD; with successfully from freeDB discrete data. therefore, you will learn the & CD; data manually to collect, instead of retrieve them from the Internet. comments will be shown to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Try not to find the & CD; this example here is a 'special' edition of the author of this Handbook.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this has not yet been done so now the & CD; in the drive that was defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and their length in the window should be listed just as shown in the screenshot. this only when the & CD; as an audio CD, could be identified and can be read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this does not happen then you are looking for questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Caution: if the & CD was successfully completed by the freeDB, all the titles of the pieces are filled out and in addition, the name of the artist and album are shown.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; key for your & CD; gives a window appears, and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best for your & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you do not have the routing for the automatic query of freeDB (on the page & CD; settings in dialog for the settings), you can also manually re-use it by choosing the first button in the toolbar. if you have no local database, you need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 Session 02: the CD-Editor - input of CD-data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; according to the sample in the next screenshot you will see the title of the piece in the first line of the input field 'Actual title', the rest of the data in the input field 'album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist does not need to enter into the input field 'Actual title' unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower comment field can be used for the individual comments sally each piece, the commentary box of the album is used for comments which apply together for all of the pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful retrieval of data from the freeDB the CD editor will not be empty, but it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editorial, so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album names (e.g. if all words with uppercase letters start or not...), but also to check if there are any unwanted comments.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: this example we use only ID3v1-tags. this limit the length of the fields on 30 characters for the artist, album and title of one piece and on only 28 characters for the comment. if you use ID3v2 tag; this option will be set up on the tab labyrinth. this option will be set up on the tab labyrinth code.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the day-information of the generated files at any time using the Tag Editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags will not be supported by all coders or file formats. see in the help of the co-erer to obtain more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Just choose an entry that obviously agrees with the style of the outread CD; in this example, this is not important, since we do not submit the & CD; data so why not go to the website of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or rap for example are to be found at rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK' you come back to the main window. simply click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD editors will be back and you will see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data we have recorded for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the current piece. the title of the piece is definitely and other information you wish.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the titles of & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the freeDB. it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the toolbar. note that the artist and the album will be shown on the item list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Notice that it has been a check-sign in front of each line of a piece. only the titles which are marked so are read. simply select that all pieces are selected, or stressing the button All pieces select on the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at one time.</seg>
<seg id="1598">Was started by clicking on the knob selection process, then this window appears to confirm. click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what happens.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the rider orders for switching on the order pane. it is in the left upper half of the window, directly under the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window for control of orders. the first piece is currently read on the hard disk. the status of the program is shown in the lower part of the window in the status line.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message you can see if you're trying to work with a co-erer, which you have not yet installed. pieces that have not been successfully coded with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the target folder are not what we have entered here in the example. did you check if you have writing to the folder for the temporary files and the target folder?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the reading of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: order 4 is the coding of pieces 1 in the format MP3. thus, read and code in parallel. note the status of the status in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has found no configuration settings to push this behavior. the only thing that can be configurable is the number of parallels processes for reading and coding. in high-performance machines the result is unclear. the machines used with a AMD64 does not seem to have a problem in simultaneous evaluation and encoding (from however two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read out, while another piece is coded and a third order is coded in the queue of the Kodiers. after the last piece is coded, a small window will appear with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window.</seg>

<seg id="1619">Graphic representation of the activity of each MIDI-channel through highlighting of the oppressed buttons on the (virtual) keyboard.</seg>
<seg id="1620">Drag & Drop that you can drag in & kde; each MIDI file from a & conqueror; window can drag on KMid set.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Supports the two existing standards to save text in MIDI files (lyrics or text valves). KMid set automatically the respective procedure.</seg>
<seg id="1622">Seat support. if you end & kde; end during the playtime of a song, KMid starts again next time with the same song.</seg>
<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI synthesizer, AWE, FM and GUS cards (for the latter you need the LUP driver and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can Open Open... from the menu file. it appears the usual file dialog with which help you can choose the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also send a file from a & Konqueror; window into the & kmid; window drop. this also works with multiple songs at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a music piece, open it and commit the button playing in the toolbar, select the entry play out of the menu pieces from or pressing the spacebar.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece automatically starts as soon as you start it on the & kmid; -window pull. (with several gaps, they will be added to a collection and then played downside.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">Once & kmid; a piece plays, you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive with the controller.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is too fast or too slow, you can click on the arrows left and right of the template and thus change the playspeed. to recover the original speed, double click the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The spacebar has two tasks: if a piece is played, a pressure on the knockhand such as a pressure on the button 'break or selecting the menu entry in the menu piece, then breaks the playback. pressing the spacebar while no piece is played, starts & kmid; playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored on two types in a music piece. some pieces use textilian, others use lyrics and again others both. some pieces do not have any text: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid; you can adjust which events are to be displayed and even better: the event type is automatically chosen to activate a song, so that you have nothing to manually adjust the entry automatic text text, but you still have the possibility to change this when you want to see the other way.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set out an event type, select from the menu Settings the entries of Texts or Liedereigsions. the same function also have keys 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files, which you summarize. these will be played in the series. in this section, how you can use collections effectively.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, you first open the collection manager. these can be found in the menu collection under the point Organize.... Click here to New and give the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then select the name for the new collection. this collection will contain at the beginning the same songs as the original.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can set the wrapped in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">In the temporary collection there are all songs that you want to add to no other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">While leaving the application this collection will not be stored. find concerns when you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, they have to be selected in the collection manager. there, you can add a song with the button Add. it appears in turn the file dialog with which help you can choose the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on the setting of automatic add to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">If automatic add to the collection is activated, a piece while opening (using File Open or Drag & Drop) automatically added to the active collection.</seg>
<seg id="1643">When automatic add to the collection is not activated, when opening an item the temporary collection is activated and punished. this collection will then be added to the opened pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to open the collection manager, the collection and the desired song and then click on Delete.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played. if you select the sequence from the menu checkup menu, the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">When you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu, the order will be fixed.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To send a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the selection list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To move a song, select the button next song, the entry next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump back a song, select the button preceding piece, the entry previous piece from the menu item or press the arrow to the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection and click the button deleting.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, this does not matter what it is not saved when leaving & kmid; not saved.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizer that are not general-MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI-map General-MIDI events will be translated into events that understands the synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map, all the events of the typs Change patch to Bright Piano in events of the typs Change patch to Trumpet converts and thus getting a trumpet again, if originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you have only one sound card, you do not need MIDI-map, because all soundcards are GM -compatible (incl. AWE - and GUS cards, FM-devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">Sorry, there are no programs to create MIDI-Maps. so you need to edit the appropriate file from hand (using your favourite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-map is a text-file that saves all necessary conversions for the playback of a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear once, except the KEYMAP -section which may appear so often as desired. the prerequisite for it is that each animal has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Defects PATCHMAP... END Define KEYMAP "name of Keymap"... END Define KEYMAP "A further Keymap"... END Define CHANNELMAP... END db... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that Define is needed to indicate that a section starts (except for options) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as an e-mail, so that I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support can be used for devices that are not general MIDI-compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section, as the patches of General MIDI to your specific keyboard is illustrated. the general use looks as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equation is ignored. it is assumed that the GM Patches are in the right sequence (from 0 to 127), you may not change the order and leave no line for any of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllkeysTo M is needed to put all notes that need this instrument to put on the sound with the number M. if your keyboard (e.g. with sound 60), you can take a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which includes the following in the PATCHMAP range section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">If now a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with Patch 127 (Win), it takes patch 100 (the Drum on your keyboard) and plays the tone 60, irrespective of which sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here with the term drum patch of the Patch is meant to be a different percussionist (drum, cymbals, Maracas & etc;) and not the one where the sound means the clay height of the always same drum (how many keyboards possess).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP Section is needed to specify as tones on a certain channel or instrument.</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with PATCHMAP -section the order of lines is very important, as well as their existence. you need to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can use multiple keyboards for each channel and each instrument. you only have to use different names in the first row.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used mainly to make sound-tints on the beacon channel. check out for example the supplied keyboards.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to form some channels to others. if you want to expose some channels from the first and second channel, make this quite simply in CHANNELMAP.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are useful for keyboards, which have percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI to Channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">Midi-Geräte you need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP Section therefore has 16 lines, numbered between 0 to 15, rebuilt following the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is part of the canal which is formed on the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the Keymap will need to be defined in the file name for this channel. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored, which will change the patch on this canal. in this case, patch is then used patch x.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful for example to use the Perspinal Patch on the beacon channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value of pitchbends gives rise to which ratio Pitch-Bender-events are multiplied. so if a MIDI file is sent a pitch-edge event with the value n * (r / 4096) and then only passed. the value 4096 is used so that in the Map File (no decimal number).</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM proposes that a pitch is supposed to play a pitch 40, a tone higher. unfortunately, however, some keyboards get higher to play by two tones down to an octave higher. to try to try the right value on your keyboard, you must try a bit of & kmid; try to try.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI-map, just open the dialog MIDI settings. this can be found in the menu under Settings, point MIDI settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The canalview is a window with a whole host of pianos (one for each MIDI channel). on these pianos you see which sounds are currently being played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can use the canalview also to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel there is a selection list where you can choose a instrument, shines the button no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has (until now) two different views to display the played notes. view the view inside menu Settings under the point of the view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The pace-LCD shows the speed at which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the pace of a song. so if you find e.g. a song be too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the pace, use the arrows left and right off the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a music piece has to be played. it contains the notes, the rhythm, the speed, & etc;. that can result the same MIDI file on two different devices, just as two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Well, I can not force anyone to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3-file you need a similar sound quality. with a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments, the speed & etc; you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">That may happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) from & kmid; have happened, because & kmid; without AWE support was compiled. to remove the problem you must download a source distribution and install (for example from kmid; 's)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection but I have no desire to add all the files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Do not agree to accept & kmid; drag & Drop. just open the folder you want to add in & Konqueror; select all the files and drag them to the & kmid; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">Do not necessarily enable the setting of automatic add to the collection. otherwise, the files are added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can click the arrow key left of the Tempo- LCD display to slow the reproduction. to restore the default pace you can double on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have been on a & kde; desktop area a & conqueror; window with my MIDI folder and & kmid; on this way I must play when the collection is to finish or I want to play a file, just into the & Konqueror; -window changes and the desired file into the window of & kmid;</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you just want to listen to a file without adding them immediately to a collection, turn off the setting automatic add to the collection, and the new; file is added to the temporary collection added.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Suppose that you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. will just want to play the first file. so set the setting automatic Add to Collection and Open A.mid. your temporary collection then contains exactly this a MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then join yourself, also B.mid and C.mid and create a collection of all three files. how do you make it?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people sent me MIDI files or postcards. all thank you! if I listen to these songs or see the postcard, animated me to write & kmid; to program.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; I'm studying mathematics at the University of Maacute; laga or for the moment I'm not much free time for my hobbies, but I'm still trying to make myself a bit of time. as hobbies I gather programming, MIDI files, music make and prove propositions.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where to download MIDI / karaoke files, if you have a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or even if you want to make me happy, write an email: larrosa @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrakis.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">You really make me a great pleasure for me if you send me a postcard from your location or a MIDI- / karaoke file from a local group. all who send me a postcard from & kmid; but if you send a MIDI file, you should contact me, as I may already have the file already.</seg>

<seg id="1930">To install a plugin or a KPart, we begin to work with the menu plug-ins. thus, the following dialogue will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1931">This dialog allows to manage all of the plugins and add new ones. we describe each & GUI; item in it:</seg>
<seg id="1932">Here you can enter the search path. when adding the plugins without a storage place & quantaplus; this path to search of the plug-in.</seg>
<seg id="1933">Often working on one project several persons in a kind of hierarchical relationship with each other. & quantaplus; supports the statement of team members and these can be configured with Shift; F7 Project Project-Properties project.</seg>
<seg id="1934">The name and email entries are self-explanatory. nickname is the nickname of the user and is used for clear identification.</seg>
<seg id="1935">One member may have several roles in the project as well as a team leader as well as subproject leaders.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can look out from the list of team members who he is. this is done by looking out the team member from the list and the button is pressed. the currently selected member (their identity) appears when you are: text.</seg>
<seg id="1937">Nickname and setting of your own identity are important in terms of news and comments. see for further information on notes.</seg>
<seg id="1938">Aside from the overview of her team there is another benefit by the collection of the members of the team: it may be an event for information to the team leader when something specific happens. see in for further information.</seg>
<seg id="1939">Event actions are actions that can be executed when something specific in the project is happening. an example would be seen how much anyone worked with it, or sending a message when a file is backed up, or a script that will play a file into the CVS, once they are added to the project & etc.</seg>
<seg id="1940">On the page event Configuration of the Shift; F7 project project settings, events can be created, edited and deleted.</seg>
<seg id="1941">An email will be sent to the list of selected addresses. the address of the address can be a team or subproject leader. see where these leaders are set up.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Comments are special comments in the documents. they differ from normal comments by the following things:</seg>
<seg id="1943">To specify notes is simple. it may either be selected from the note entry from the editor context or the @ annotation key word in a comment or by comments text.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Notes can be a determining member of the team. in this case, the syntax @ annotation (nickname) or @ annotation (roll), a role in the project from the following possibilities: team leader Subproject managers should be introduced to the appropriate zone or subproject names, as in the following examples below.</seg>
<seg id="1945">Nickname and roll names are independent of large or small-charities, but spaces around the brackets and the: make the note invalid.</seg>

<seg id="1948">The settings can be set by means of Settings Quanta. diesel dialog can be accessed through some pages that are dealt with each other.</seg>
<seg id="1949">The behaviour of & quantaplus; for tags including car completion can thus be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1950">Large / jewel case of tags: large / low-keeping of automatically added tags. normal Groß / Kleinschema signifies, the tags will be ininserted as described in the day XML files.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Large / Classifieds of attributes: large / Kleinscheings of automatically added attributes. regular Large / Kleinscheings means, the attributes are inserted as inserted as they are described in the day XML files.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Optional tags automatically include: if pact, becomes optional for tags, for which the exclusive day is optional, this immediately added to the & gt;</seg>
<seg id="1953">Not optional tags will automatically include: as above for all other tags, except the simple tags.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Starting and finish tag automatically update: when switched, the corresponding day is changed and vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Automatic adjustment of accent characters: controls the automatic conversion of the placental sign in the corresponding coding during the insertion.</seg>
<seg id="1956">MIME types: mimics types for detection of different types of files. by means of the standard, the default values can be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Standard recoding: the coding of newly created or in other way than with file opening files (where the encoding of the file can be passed over). however, this attitude here is being loaded from the same in the project properties, if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD will be used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD has not been recognized. this setting here will however extend from the same in the project properties, if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Creating a backup copy: & quantaplus; created regularly backup copies, so that with a blackout or crash the next start of the program can be recovered from this backup. this is not the same as saving the file. even if not stored documents is created a backup regularly, according to the specified time, created.</seg>
<seg id="1960">The preview and documentation can either be displayed in the editor area or your own view (or the documentation in a box), what makes it possible, the documentation, the preview and the source code at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1961">Set up the window frames to the default at the next start is useful when the user interface has come through modifying the MDI modes and andocks / depend on views to each other. it corresponds to the --resetlayout Command system parameters.</seg>
<seg id="1962">The warning feedbacks serves the control of the possibility of unlock the display of warnings by the hacks of no longer.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The place to change the behavior of & VPL; it can be displayed by symbols instead of scripts as well as the synoptic behavior of the VPL- and the source code in shared mode. as regards the different modes.</seg>
<seg id="1964">Here the parser and the structural tree, which represents the illustration of the parser node in the document to be set in details.</seg>
<seg id="1965">In the area of mouse-click on the structural-tree causes the following action is possible to change by clicking the structural tree with the drop-in action.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the area of structural-settings the visibility of nodes in the tree can be opened automatically, adjusted. blank knots are automatically opened in the empty areas in the text, while empty groups are not found in the current document there is no element found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The area for setting up the abbreviations of abbreviations (one type of templates) that can be divided into groups, each can be divided for several & DTEP; s may be valid for several & DTEP; s means it can be a valid group for PHP, in which the ifof abbreviation may be considered in a group valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Here you can manage the plugins. plugins are KPart-Application from third page, which can be reused by each KPart-enabled application, on the most famous & Konqueror;. when inserting a plug-ins, the following is required:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to the plugin if it is not at a stand there as $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Input: this information will pass the plug-in at the start, so it can open the current file, the corresponding folder (path of the current file) or the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="1971">Component in "" "" Only-Lese "" "" mode load: check if the plugin denied the store. only-Lese-Kparts usually refuse the store if this option is not chosen. "" "</seg>
<seg id="1972">Verified the plugin: is this activated, then testa & quantaplus; if the given information is correct. pick the deposit even if the plugin is not available for the moment, but it will be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantaplus; from version 3.3, the debugging was completely redesigned. diversion for the no more necessary built-in & PHP; (3) Debugger was implemented, as well as the support for the DBG debugger. instead of it, a debugger-Plugin concept was implemented, which allows different implementations about plugins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently only a plugin available, the support for the use of & gubed; inquantaplus; added.</seg>
<seg id="1975">The use of the debugger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable debugger plug-in in the project settings. with the button options next to the debugger-plug-in selection, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If a debugger project uses a debugger, some additional elements appear at the & quantaplus; interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view displayed in which the contents of monitored variables is displayed. normally, in the left-left dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view where all holding points, with reference to and conditions are listed, usually in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view in which the output is shown (as shown in HTML) of the debugger. usually, in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported functions of the debugger, everything is available or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">With this action the connection to debugger, if necessary, or she shares the plugin with, based on Debugantries. this action will be triggered by default when a project is open, which must not be considered a debugger, so that it must not be worth it.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to Debuggen session starts the session. closes the connection to the debugger or ends the lugs to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends a HTTP requirement to the server to initiate a debug request. this is also synonymous with the use of a browser to see the current document. the issue of this requirement is shown in the view debugger issue.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Points to the Debugger to start the execution of the script and to continuously send out information about the surveillance variables, as well as the currently executed on line. if this happens, when the script is halted, the execution is continued before a debut requirement was started, the script starts with the request.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Points to the debugger, with the execution of the script, without information to send out variables and current tick-number. if this happens, while a script is halted, the execution continues. happens before a debut requirement was given, begins the execution as soon as a requirement is made.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The Debugger leads to the next statement on the script without going into the functions or process.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The Debugger leads the next statement on the script when possible into functions and re-related messages.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Points to the debugger to pass the statement and go to the next so as if there is not the current one.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog, where a variable or an expression can be entered, which shall be monitored. the surveillance value appears in the variable view.</seg>
<seg id="1990">This dialog can be added to a variable or a new value of a variable.</seg>

<seg id="1993">Document type Edipet package (DTEP; s) are used in & quantaplus; used to provide support for Markup- and scripting languages as well as & CSS; they allow & quantaplus; skills such as car-completion and IDE; a quick, user-friendly & IDE; for web developers, easy to use and productive.</seg>
<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s there are two types, family 1, the Markup languages and family 2, the script languages and & CSS;. & DTEP; s are made up of two parts, the day folder and the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be created manually (see below), downloaded or automatically created from an existing DTD. see for details for conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how to create the XML files, then the & descriptionrc; and also toolbar. in short, one & DTEP;</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attribute for tags as well as the layout and content of the property analysis, the & quintranrc; file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; for the day, the tool contains a fast editing of tags in a document without risk of writing.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag Programmes are nothing but folder. they contain only the & descriptionrc; and the XML files. day folders carry the name of the description language and version, so present. (for example, html-4.01 points)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of the TagXML and decoded whether they are necessary or not. although not all necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have better insight and more information when working with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes every element in detail. everything about the possibilities and boundaries is explained in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">That is the root element of a conference document. it can only occur once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but as only the element type has nothing else than itself anything else.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tags is a script feature. when used, & lt; attr &gt; an argument in function. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Only for the conference type class valid. the name of the base class for this class. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Only for the type of input cells. returns the name of the class where this method belongs. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, the day has a development attribute group and the attributes inside these tags can be added to any other day. (only family 1)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Sets up a text in the dialog. this text is determined by the & lt; text &gt; -day. this is a single element of element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Describes a attribute of a tags. this item can occur once for each attribute. it puts the name and type of the attribute being fixed. additionally, it contains other tags that should describe how this attribute should be shown & etc; This is an only element element.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Returns the source materials used for the attributes in the day editorial dialog and the attribute-tree</seg>
<seg id="2009">Requires source = dcop. the dcop interface within & quantaplus; is used for reaching source data.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and the name of an interface. the dcop methodology within & quantaplus; is used to achieve the data source.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, a pattern, and a method name. the arguments that can be handed over to the method. may be empty or on-name%, which means the name of the current tags.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container day grouped the elements of a list together. it can occur for an attribute description only once. it is a single element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Sets the position of the attribute of a tags within a dialog box. this day can happen for each attribute in a dialogue only once (e.g. once for each one & lt; attr &gt; -day). the item is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Returns the position and size of a field in dialogue. this day should be present for each field in dialogue even (e.g. one for each and lt; attr &gt; und & lt; label &gt; Day). this item is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">Returns a list of elements that may occur inside the tags. this item is an element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Returns a list of elements that end a day. this item is an element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All TagXML files must start with an & XML; -Devisualisation: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be neat and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Idols do not affect anything, but pay attention to & and & lt; signs. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; whatsthis &gt;, and & lt; text can be replaced. this will not cause any arrest, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check out the conference files, the Tools dialog above in & quantaplus; window to start and check out TagXML. to select another dialog will appear to follow its simple instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This feature is currently not yet available. currently, the check is only done when loading the conference file in & quantaplus;</seg>
<seg id="2021">In the following an example of a family 1 TagXML file. this file describes the & lt; schema &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML; schema. the file name for this conference file should be schema.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2022">In the following an example of a functioning family 2 TagXML file. this file is described one & PHP; overlade function. the filename of this conference file should be overload.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2023">& lt;? XML version = "UTF-8"? &gt; & lt; tag name = "overload" type = "class _ name" type = "string" state = "optional" / &gt; & lt; / day &gt; & day &gt;</seg>
<seg id="2024">The & descriptionrc; File is just as easy and there is an editor to be accessible via DTD Bearbeite DTD. with it, diedescriptionrc; for a newly created & DTEP; for a newly created & DTEP; should be created a simple & descriptionrc; for a newly created & DTEP; should be created with following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[general] Version = use 1 for & quantaplus; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for any higher version. name = DTD's statement. (- / / W3C; / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name is used as nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">A action can set up with settings actions... click on New Promotion leads to the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">This is linked with button shortcut. by clicking the button custom can be assigned a keyboard shortcut; with one of the current keyboard shortcut.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. it can be typed a text in the detailed settings and when executing the action will add this text in the document to the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the powerful action type. with the help of this action you can use external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) to use the document or as input (or parts of the document). even the quick start -dialog or the different See in... actions for the (X) HTML-DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">The first must be the name of the script and interpreter. for example: SH / home / myHome / myscripts. sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% freebase variable in the command line: $KDEDIR / share / apps / quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH There are other special variable which can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we will be replaced with the URL of the current document. in the event of a local document is file: / from the document name.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% PID: will be replaced with the PGD of the ongoing & quantaplus; only one instance is running, the text is unique to the PID-number. this is useful when DCOP is used to control & quantaplus; by the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the filename of the current document or the path to the project-file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the above methods, a script can be sent from & quantaplus; to the default input. in the selection field input can be determined, which is to be sent to the default input.</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected section of the document will be sent to the script. the% input variable is usually advisable only with this setup.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input can also be redirected to the output of the application, there are two types of output: normal output, based on the default transmission. it may be specified, what the default column can be specified by the default box:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the Markup language, it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups. it is necessary to create a toolbar for each group. in the given case, it is not too many, therefore one can create a toolbar with the name of the market.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar is added, you must add and configure actions. select Settings actions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are quite self-explanatory. press the Neue Action button at the bottom of the window starts the Edit Mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill in all the required fields and add them to the matching toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete everything and, if the tag has attributes, and you plan their use, activate a dialog "Day," if available, so that an entry into using the action is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igor! is this a ugly symbol. who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol? replace it before we have difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol, that the action is better represented, we will use & ciconedit; choose from the & kmenu;, graphics other programs (or where else it is located in their distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; used by default 32x32 pixels, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit size.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created symbol not only helps you to remember what the action does, but also all the other users of the DTEP;</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to that the day start, means I decided to create a launcher as a symbol. through the use of green (green is usually interpreted as loose, died, or should at least, an message to the user signalized that click this symbol a & lt; startled; start the day in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol it must be linked to the action. this happens via the menu with Settings actions... (in & quantaplus;) and selecting the desired action. next to the text field is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder in which the stored icon is located, select it and confirm with the OK button.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Click the applied button and continue it with other tags, so there is still which gives or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some usual & quantaplus; functions to work toolbar or it should adjust this to better overview by some separators in several groups. open the toolbar and adjust dialog on settings toolbar. make sure that the desired toolbar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to choose the separator (completely left above) for my toolbar, which is to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I want to add a quick way to access the Konqueror Preview. I will select it and add to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note, as the separator aid the grouping. someone who does not know my toolbar, could believe that the & Konqueror; -button the opposite of the start push.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar has to be tested using all symbols tested to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Secure into the correct folder. after NeueXML does not exist, it will be saved in the right folder but your toolbar (s) should be loaded in the right folder. please adjust their work toolbar (s), when a file is opened by the corresponding type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the mentioning extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scripting language or the formatting language that you like most. therefore, this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; document marks for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentation, you could check in & quantaplus; -Repository, whether someone has done it for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first, you have to search a existing documentation for formatting / script / etc. language. then you need to create the docrc file. we leave the first part to you, the second part we treat here.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc dir = Path, relatively to this file, for example image Section 1 = Section1.html Section 2 = Sectionhtml Sections = Section2.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the document tree. for example, you see now in the & PHP; documentation so something:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config File [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level = Table of Contents = index.html</seg>
<seg id="2063">Take note of the # before starting the Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is subfolder in the tree with its own content. there is no known frontier for chess training (except through reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">You notice that the directory is referenced directly to a file (and more consequential at the top end of the track record & mdash; folder is displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Idols affect nothing but pay attention to & and & lt; character. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resourcefateien will be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content section is the area of the docrc file, which is used for the design of the context-sensitive help. for example, when writing a & PHP; script for context-help the documentation would be displayed directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file connectors.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of modeled context-elements that should be available (for & PHP;) these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your file docrc to save your file docrc / share / apps / quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / quanta / doc for local or global use. then create a folder (such as you can write this in your file docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation there.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that this well and it is worth to be shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation have been used to be rich in the & quantaplus; -Repository for use by the & quantaplus; -Structure. you will not be rich, but proud to have worked on the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus; are you not alone. it is possible to divide the resources (DTEP packages, toolbar with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can send by e-mail to friends, partners or else to anyone. at different places there is an e-mail menu entry, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP) with e-mail, toolbar toolbar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our main archive, from where all the other & quantaplus; users can download it. the contributions are reviewed and only available when our team needs them as accurate and useless for publishing. in order to make use of the resources it provides a GPG / PGP key. thus, the origin of the resources is guaranteed, both for our team and for the later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you are asked for their private GPG key after their private GPG page (the Passphrase is not saved), or in the case that you have multiple keys you can submit a search. in the dialog New resource you need to empty the input fields (URL Preview can be empty) and with clicking OK the uploading program will be started.</seg>
<seg id="2074">The uploading can upload from the menus DTD DTD package (DTEP), toolbar toolbar, and in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, still before installation, investigated & quantaplus; the irreconcile of the resource by checking of integrity and signating. please note the warning messages carefully. if the integrity has been given and the resource correctly appears, a message appears with the specification of the author of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work in XML languages, which is currently not supported by & quantaplus; it is necessary to work by creating a DTEP package. it gives the easiest way to convert a DTD automatically into a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The transformation can be started by the DTD Download menu and Convert DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description which is to be used. afterwards the following dialogue will appear:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target directories: the newly created & DTEP; will be written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! Doctype definitions: the string found in the! Doctype Tag, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / html4 / loose.dtd</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of the DTEP after conversion: if activated, brings & quantaplus; after the transformation the & descriptionrc; -Editor, with the details of newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to utilize this possibility.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus; there are some key concepts. to understand this and take full benefit from & quantaplus; therefore, one must first give them to this fundamental concepts. this chapter tries to bring them exactly these concepts, without their understanding & quantaplus; little uses.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus; the working area is divided into three main areas: global, locally and projections. this distinction involves a number of components in & quantaplus;</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for each, the & quantaplus; uses, available. by materials, it is all that is a global folder structure of & quantaplus; this enables the group of administrators to secure different toolbar, actions and patterns in the global tree, which will then be available in a multi-user environment.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements present a personal collection of web development for a single user. they are user-specific patterns and toolbar. local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are available only within a specific project. this can be done from & CSS; pattern up to toolbar size with special actions especially for the files of a particular project. just said, this is the most restricted size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which provides common use of special tools and patterns on all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; MDI; consists of some main areas: the Editorial, the ads with information and the toolbar. please refer to, and for further information on these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the carton with the right mouse button to reload a context menu with the current documentation, reload, delete or upload the document, jump to a bookmark or version of CVS commands to current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right-click in the editorial department lead to a further context menu regarding the edited document contents, how basic editing steps (to cut / copy / paste), edit under the mouse pointer or opening the file, when the string under the mouse-cursor is referred to a file.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top end of the editors, the tool shows. at present & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as standard has been shown. in the course of further expansion of & quantaplus; the tool shows the new functions and related user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbar is really easy. if they want to insert a simple tag, e.g. & lt; pgt; in their document then click on the icon that has to insert the day. now, they can insert the data for this just added day (like anchor), you can insert in a dialogue different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The builders (QIT;) allow it to navigate in the information about & quantaplus; to navigate it and pass through. in the display with boxes are available for files, project, sample templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool that provides & quantaplus; prepared this view shows all the files in the project and allows managing files in the project by means of right mouse click. actions like adding, unloading, upload or deleting the files from the storage media can be performed with the displayed context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another chance of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. nearly everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website & etc; It will be open to you all possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories, depending on how to use it. the category is always available, local Templates are available only for relevant users and templates in projects are available only in the project. more about templates is in.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you will find information about the available scripting languages. the concept of reintegration in Global, Local and Project also works here. by clicking on the left mouse button you can call the available information to a script, such as the script to start editing or send with EMail.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With this view one shows the internal structure of the active document. through links-clicking of the tab, the cursor is set in the document to the position of the element. through right-clicking of an item, a list of commands in relation to navigation and refresher of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among the other buildings. with it, you can change attribute and naming rooms. the modification of all available attributes allows you to change all the available attributes with just a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation to find the web-technology for your development. there can be pre-packed documentation for & quantaplus; from quantaplus; "document site can be created, and by adding a folder doc to a project can be added to project specific documentation, edic and regards.</seg>

<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should be filled with the top from top to bottom, since for example after filling the project called the whole directories structure will be automatically completed for the rest of the project. all these paths and author expressions can be adjusted later with Shift; F7 project project characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project to enter, for example foo. when entering name it is automatically filled.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; project-file. by default, it has the name of the project in small letters and without spaces with the extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>

<seg id="2179">The project management gives free access to files in the project. there, the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folders will be used, however the entries can be opened and opening with the right mouse button in the context menu:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can search different profiles. the profile contains information about the place of the uploaded files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows removing the current profile. if only one profile is present, the button is hidden to prevent the removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password will keep in the core memory and forget about programs. this possibility is useful when frequent reload files is needed and the more unsecure password is stored on the disk -option not come into question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialog until you change your mind from the uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus; many high loads profiles can be uploaded and thus the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to various servers. when working or creating a profile, this dialog displays:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server to be copied to the files. either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address function.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for the uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed KIO slaves. at least, you should choose from & FTP;, file (locally) and nfs.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for transfer. normally, this must not be changed except the network administrator does not operate a service at the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your attunlock, this is either a time-saving function or a danger. use it according to your discretion. the password will be saved on the disk so that it can not be easily read, but each with programming results can be easily seen in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only one set of files and toolbar. it can be loaded in a project many views, i.e. by simple exchange of view, various files and toolbar must be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be saved in the menu project or the project toolbar, accessible via settings of toolbar project toolbar, open or deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus; with which one has most to do. this helps not only increase productivity but also allows the adaptation of & quantaplus; to its own working method.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above are toolbar icons in & quantaplus; best deals with the menu of toolbar. use and Adding differ. the addition of toolbar is treated down in the section Adding toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbar icons and the symbols can either be set by using the context menu (right-click on the toolbar), there may be other promotions as toolbar, toolbar or toolbar, which can be shown in the dialog, where actions can be visible on this or other toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (icon) on a toolbar, in addition, the entries will remove and action to be processed, which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The tool shows and the actions on them can set up with settings toolbar and set settings.. set.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are in essentially visual editing, code carnip and files to the link. & quantaplus; used templates such as a program file system with expanded organization and interfaces. you can copy, move or install any of the system available in the storage space. templates have in & quantaplus; in approximately the restrictions you imagine for the filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; provided designs have conditions for their use. please read the conditions attached at the beginning of each template prior to use exactly.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary is all that is not purposeful text. it can be installed every file except text, so images, & PDF; s, Flash files & etc; binary templates are usually included in documents using linkages (e.g. pictures with img src = / src / url). some examples can be found in the storage room under global templates. additional information about templates is available in documents.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be created by any text document. based on these templates, new documents can be created. normally, a simple scaffold for the purpose and organizes the work in appropriate way to be efficient. some examples can be found in the storage room under global templates. see in for more information about templates.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This kind of templates is useful if not a new document will be inserted based on a template but the same text area again. you can find everything from a comment on a final note up to a complete quantity system on Javascript or Perl base. some examples are in the storage room under global templates. see in for more information about templates.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these are used for whole sites as templates. they are a collection of various documents, which can be organized in a folder structure, together in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantaplus;</seg>
<seg id="2203">Create a document structure by means of choice (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc.) and select File As a template save as local submission...</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once that has been done, notice that (even if it was recorded as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. look at the pre-tree under project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click File As a template to store selection as a local / project template. alternatively, the selection may be dragged with ornaming and attach it to the construction of building templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file can only copy into one folder folder. it can be used all file management functions, such as ortoes and paste or inserting about the file tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can select inside the file tree or in the project files building blocks to a folder on the right and backup site template, backed up a name for the template and secure it. by default, it will be stored as local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates enable a very purposeful occurrence. you can insert headlines and footlines or connect them dynamically with them. additionally you can keep some things while using templates in projects very deep in mind.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The storage structure in the sub-window templates is based on the in $KDEDIR / share / apps / quanta / load and $HOME / .kde / share / quanta / onloading / coqueried files. each of this folder corresponds to one of four types of container, as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To specify the behavior of a folder overview with the right mouse button on the folder and select the context menu features. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection of the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection has been canceled, as soon as the elective attributes is deed.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fits all except the stem folders in this path, unless they were explicitly enabled in this path, unless they were explicitly activated. in case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text-item. if nothing appears, you probably have to be in a stem folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Permits or presented text for templates in this folder. these could be general headlines or footers for all templates for a particular project and enables complete presentation to equip a whole presentation with the right headlines / footers.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you can press (click on the right mouse button) through a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and paste from templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; -Editor and VPL; & Source text editor, which are accessible via the Edit menu. the first mode replaces the editor text editor in two parts: the source text editor and the VPL; -Editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; -Editor works as follows: he invites a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -page and a cursor. then you can edit and turn back into the source code editor in which the changes made changes are visible in the VPL; Editor in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; -Editor on a document, which includes PHP; contains a small green symbol the Vohandision of & PHP; source code. it is not possible to edit this directly with the VPL; -Editor. to edit the source text editor. there is no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works exactly like the first, except that the changes are displayed both in the source Editor and the VPL; -Editor is already active, this mode is already active, enables the pressing fire the active cursor of a window to the other, whereby the position in the document will be maintained.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools for comparisons. so why & kdiff3;? let me explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The interchange was very complicated because one of the contributors had done many changes and at the same time fixes the emitting. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file, and the result were numerous conflicts in the interconnecting.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program used for me only showed me the modified lines, but I could not see what exactly changed within these lines. and there was no references to places where perhaps only the reverse had changed. the merging of these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could be differences within one line and changes to white signs. later, a lot of other useful functions have been added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to compare for example quickly, simply copy it to the clipboard and paste it into one of the comparisons window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparing and merge of folders. this function changed & kdiff3; almost in a fully-filled file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way merge is fully supported. this is useful when two people can work independently of each other at one piece of coes and make changes. the original file is facilitated by using proper modifications. the assembling sub-buttons allows you to edit the result. in this editor, you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three Quell files by merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you in the same and assembling complete folders. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; in the folder merging:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; shows the exact differences and detrimental to the possibilities of today's shades. if you have to check frequently code, you will like this feature.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white signs and taboators are visible. if the lines are only in a certain number of white signs, one can see this at a glance at the summary in the left side of the left. (no hassle more if Jemand the reverse.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is equal, and the other is different in a row, then displays the color that file is different. red color means that both files differ.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name, but in various folders, you can make the tipping work easier by just write the filename of the first file completely.</seg>
<seg id="2293">"" "kdiff3 Ordner2-diff3 Ordner2 Ordner3 Ordner3 Ordner3 Ordner3 Ordner3 Ordner3 Ordfolder</seg>
<seg id="2294">The Open dialog allows the manual type of file names, the selection of the file browser (file...) or selecting a recently opened file from the opening list. you don't have to specify the third file for the next time. you don't need to specify the entry for C, the analysis of the differences with two files will be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Through the button folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the same or merging of folders will be selected, for B and C, however, a folder, then use & kdiff3; the filename from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If collectively, the input field is active and lets itself edit. however, it is not necessarily required to specify immediately a output file. you can get this step later on storing.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The insertion -button opens a dialog with settings. here you can set options before you start with the same / assembling.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you do not want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to select text parts from the clipboard into the active comparative window. the comparison will then you need not select files, you can simply enter the dialog with the breaking-button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and drop it: just drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">Which thought is behind it? sometimes, a file contains such a few similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these features are, it would only be a relatively great effort. you only need to load two corresponding files, they have to upload and then compare them. now you can copy the relevant sections simply, add and then compare.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently you cannot draw anything from & wdiff3; only the case display of text in a comparison window will be supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the toes and set text into another program as out and paste (instead of copying and paste). in such a case, your original data might be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">In the upper part of each text window, the info section of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and the Zeiling number of the first visible line in the window. (note that the mouse over a file is available, let the mouse to rest a while on the line. then a small Help window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are the letters A, B and C assigned. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these presets can be changed via the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">When a difference is detected, one sees at the color that file is different. if both files differ, the preset color is especially useful when you compare three files. that's in the next section (merging) good to see.</seg>
<seg id="2306">Left next to the text is the abstracts column. if differences were found, the color shows the corresponding paint. in some programming languages the color is not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (at C / C + + e.g. are white signs only in string and comments, relevant for the preprocessor and in a few, rare retailers.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line, which identifies the abstraction column of the text, is interrupted by the places where the respective source file has no lines. if the ceiling is activated, the line is displayed in surrounding lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (under the comparisons) also has a info-line containing the wording: the filename and [changed] if you have edited the result. usually, it contains through the automatic assembling already texts, but it often contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are resolved, the stork is deactivated!!! (use the buttons jump to closest conflict / ungsten conflict to find even remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparisons are used, each difference is also a conflict which must be solved manually at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking on the left mouse button in one of the windows that belonged to the line group in all windows, and the first line of the group is shown. (thus, this group will then be visible the current group. it is highlighted in the color background color for the current range and on the left appears a black-called beam.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes by the automatic co-operation or by manual work no further line is left in the group; there is only a place of space for the event that you change your opinion and maybe you choose another source. this text does not appear in the final file, nor in a marker that you might want to copy and do what else.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; quotes; however, appears in the clipboard if you copy such text from the result window. go gently with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: if you are interested in selecting the sources the options ignore or Ignoriere C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigating mainly with the image drives and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard, you can use the arrow keys left, right, close, close, close and string finish, Siw as you are used also by other programs. the overcoming column next to the vertical image line can also be used by clicking on the Navisification.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the Eye window you can also use the other buttons for editing. with the insertion button you can switch between insert and overloaded mode. (preset is the insertion mode).</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the abstracts columns will synchronize the view of all windows to the beginning of each group (as already in the section and the editable output window explained).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous conflict (Strg-below / Strg-Image), to the next / previous conflict (Strg-Image downward) or to the next / previous conflict (Strg-Image downward) or to the next / previous conflict. therefore, there must be automatically deleted between solves and ungsten conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the markings into the clipboard, you need to press the Copy button (Strg-C or Strg inserting). if this is enabled, what ever you mark, be copied into the clipboard and be careful, as you could overwrite so the content of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Zeileners are stored according to the underlying operating system. Unix variants use a single-board sign\, and Win32-based systems use wagering\\ r\. KDiff3 retains the Zeileners of source files not on, therefore you should use & kdiff3; also not using binary files.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of the most recently used files will be automatically saved and restored at the next start. (menu Settings- &gt; KDiffuser setup...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Choose a font with fixed width. (on some systems the dialog displays writings with variable width to choose from, you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you enable this option, differences are displayed in cursiver script. if the chosen characters does not support this representation, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colours could not be available in its pure form, but would be framed on these systems, the button presenters is automatically an unresolved color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">When this option is activated, the pressures of the tabulator button is inserted the corresponding number of spaces. otherwise, a spulator is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you press the input or return, the default of the previous line will be used automatically for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">When this option is activated, each selection is automatically copied to the clipboard. the manual copy into the clipboard will then fall.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which type-end-type you prefer to store. the default value is the generally usual selection of the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When using files attempt to find & kdiff3; first, all completely identical lines in the source files. only during this first step may be white signs. in this step, white signs are not ignored. in this step, white signs are not ignored. even when gathering, white signs are not ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on certain systems) save a wagon sign '\' at the end of a line, others only save a tick-sliding sign, but then they could be treated with different sizes on the side-side comparison, however, like a white sign. during the interruption, this option must be disabled. in the default, this option is disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In default, this option is disabled. in the first part of the analysis, numbers and associated signs ('0' - '9', '.' - ') ignored. in the result the differences will be shown, but they are treated like white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In default, this option is disabled. changes in comments are treated like changes in white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensively still searching for smaller differences. this option is activated in default. it is effective in complicated and large files, but slowly with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In Automatically-Setting mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next unresolved conflict will continue.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Automatically detachment all conflicts in white signs by selecting the selected file as a source. if you need this only from time to time, then take advantage of the functions voters A / B / C for all unresolved white conflicts from the merging menu. note that the automatic selection also involves conflicts in numbers or comments if the options are ignore or Ignoriere C / C + + -comments.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are treated in the chapter on scanning of folders and pass on a composition. check out the details below documentation for directory comparison and conduction.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is stored and already an older version, the original version contains the Suffix .orig. if there is already such backuploaded file with the Suffix .orig, it will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adapts the language of the user interface. the amendment of this option does not affect the currently ongoing program. you must finish & kdiff3; finish and reboot that the change becomes active. (this option is in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is provided across the control center.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following encoding settings can be adjusted for each entry separately. if you have activated this option, the upper setting is used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">Concerning the coding fields for coding appears a short notice, which is the local coding. (this can not be changed here and has for you purely informal nature.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file coding for source files. this affects how special signs are treated and interpreted. as the coding for each file is individually adjustable, even files can be compared and combined with different coding.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited one file, you can specify which coding is to be used for storing.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define preliminary processing, you might not be able to work with your codec. (for example, your files might be 16-bit Unicode, but the workingprocessing can only set with 8-bit ASCII.) With this option one can specify the coding of the output of processing workmps.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn off to push the highlighting of changes in white signs into text or review. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignore or Ignoriere C / C + + -comments.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all the differences between two of three files are displayed. but sometimes you wish to see only the differences between two of three files. after selection from A & lt; gt; C or B & lt; in addition, C is shown next to the normal nor a second oversee column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you'd prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines. simply select the less important windows. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Submit the comparisons next to each other or overseated. this can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you consider the differences and then decide to merge the files together. a simple click starts the conduction and uses the filename of the last source file as a prest names for the output file. (if this function is used to restart the merge again, then the name of the most recently used output file will be maintained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file it is handed over to this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the instruction will be visible, and not the file itself. you can use your own preprocessor that is exactly your requirements. you can use this function for example to cut-out parts or rectify the insertion.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file it is handed over first to this external command. if a normal pre-processing command is specified (see above), then the output of the instruction will only be used at random, which corresponds exactly your requirements. each input row must have a related issue line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind it is to allow users more flexibility when posting the diff results. however, an external program requires, and most users do not want to program the good news, however, that in most cases sed or perl fully sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this process-processing fixed for Zeilenabals to convert the input into large letters: SED's /\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ 'The\\ 1 in the first scale string. the\\ U thread the found text in large letters.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other versioncontrol systems use some key passwords to automatically insert (info: / cvs / keyword substitution). all follow the same pattern $\\\\ _ BAR _\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experiment with ås, you might start to understand it and maybe you may have these regular expressions even. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">The ignore of numbers is actually an already built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example for another pre-processing fixed for Zeilenabequally suitable. s / [0123456789.-] / / g'Jedes sign between '[' and ']' is replaced by nothing, so they will be deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several requirements at one time. then you can use the semicolon ';' use to separate the compositions from one another. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed, you can also use something different such as perl. perl -p -e's / REGEXP / Replacement / switches' allergies at perl some details different. where sed\\ (and\\) requires perl only (and) without the aforementioned '\\'. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data according to the normal preprocessor will be maintained for viewing and maintain. the further operations only change the data which the Zeilenabide-algorythm can be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases, if you use a normal preprocessor, the Zeilenrollout section sees the output of the normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function, the text changes or differences hidden, you can not notice certain differences and destroy relevant data in the worst case.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often, programmers have to deal with a folder many files. for this reason you can compare with & kdiff3; complete folders recursively compare and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a suggestion for each object to assemble a suggestion; you can adjust the proposal before the start;</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the intersimulated and shows the simulated changes without being carried out,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... selected actions with either all (F7 button), or only with selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is the comparing and assembling of individual files very similar. you only need to specify folders at the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three folders are merged, then folder 1 is used as a base. if no goal folder was specified, used & wdiff3; Ordner3 as target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts, not start-up. to start the gathering, you must select the appropriate menu entry or press the F7 button. (further details follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folder you will find a small message window above the current progress. if you abort the scanning, only the files listed until then were compared.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning is complete the folder shows & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and each folder that was found during the scan will be shown here in a tree. you can select an object with a single click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is normally represented together. you can double a folder by clicking on the + / - click on the object or using the arrow keys for left / right. the directory menu contains two functions all subdirectories and select all subdirectories with which you can soap any folders or folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">If you double click on a file, the file is immediately started and it appears a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The icon in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folder, this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object. in such a case the gathering action is not automatically chosen. if the merging will be started, you will be informed of problems of this kind again.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the above image, are used in the columns A / B / C the colors red, Green, Yellow and Black.</seg>
<seg id="2376">For identical entries the colour is also identical, although the age of the entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders will be identical as the same if their entire content is identical. then the folder also have the same color. in folders, the age is unsignificant for its colour.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea for this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a quiver again which is only green, then yellow is and later, when it is old, red will.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical, but not B: copy of B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical, but not C: copy of C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical, but not A: copy of A (or if A does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C not have the same file type (e.g. if a folder and B is a file): error: contradictory data types. as long as such faulty objects exist, the merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same file type (e.g. if a folder and B is a file): error: contradictory data types. as long as such faulty objects exist, the merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The mode for synchronize is active, if only two folders and no explicit target folder, and if the option directories can be synchronized. then select & kdiff3; the necessary action to follow, so that both folders are identical. if for an entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist, but not identical: merge and save the result in both folders. (the user looks as the visible filename for the output file only B; directly after the merging copy & kdiff3; B by A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">When two folders will be merged and select the new file instead of cooperative (uncertain) then the date of files and suggests the newer file to copying. if the files are different, but the date is identical.. While such errors are not eliminated, the merging of the folder cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">During the merging a file is processed after the other. you state column shows Fertig if the merging was successful, and according to other reports when something unexpected occurred. if the merging is finished, you should make a last check and check if the status is all right.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If in the redirectional method of full analysis is chosen, KDiffuser reads more columns, deleted, not white and white conflicts. (the column for deleted conflicts is only shown when three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge the currently selected entry (file or Odner), or all entries at once. if you have selected all the connections actions (also in all subfolders), you can start the merging.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you have not specified target folder, then in the three-folder association mode C will be used as the target, in the Two-folder merging will be chosen as the target and used when synchronize, A and / or B as a goal.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a target folder, please check if all entries will be displayed in the target folder, also in the folder structure. there are some options to be skipped across certain entries. check these options to avoid unadful surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To perform all entries: select directory entry / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the keyboard shortcut). to only perform the current entry: select action from the current element or push F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If the contradictory co-types exist still invalid actions, a message appears on the faulty elements aside. you can then select a valid action.</seg>
<seg id="2394">If you merge all entries, a dialogue window appears with the options run simulate and breaking down.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Choose simulate if you first see what would happen without which really changes will be made. you will then receive a detailed list of all the promotions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then perform certain actions with all entries. if a manual procedure is needed (running a single file), then a merging window will open (note the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">If you are ready to start with a file, select again folders / continue, or press F7. if you have not saved it, a corresponding dialog. then leads & kdiff3; continue working with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If & kdiffuse; on an error messages, a message appears and detailed status of information. at the end of the list you will see some messages that will help you to select the cause of the problem or to skip the problem entry or to solve the problem in another way before you proceed to the assembling.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some of the entries were individually gathered, such entries (in the current session) and leads them further together again. even if here the merging was skipped or not saved, these entries are considered settled. only if you change the merging action, these entries will again be merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & Kdiff3; (menu Settings - &gt; KDiffuser setup...) now has a section called directory-conduction with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that appear on the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree. separate the pattern with a semicolon;. valid credit card: '*' and '?'. (e. g. * .cpp; * .h). the default value is *.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders contained in this pattern are not shown in the elementary tree; there may be more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid credit card: '*' and '?'. presetting is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders contained in this pattern are not shown in the elementary tree; there may be more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid credit card: '*' and '?'. presetting is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files that are also ignored by CVS. many autmatically created files are ignored by CVS. the great advantage is that this folder specifically with a .cvsignore file can be set. (look at info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems, files have a hide -attribute. in other filesystems, a specified score marks a file as hidden. this option lets you decide whether these files are shown in the elementary tree or not. this option is switched on in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">With links to files: when the option is deactivated, symbolic linkages are compared. if the option is switched, the files will be compared to which the links show. this is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">In links to folder: when the option is deactivated, the links are switched as normal folders and recursively undergo possible. (note that & kdiff3; not on possible recurrent. a link to a folder that would lead to yourself to a end loop and & kdiff3; crashes.) This option is deactivated in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Executing a complete analysis of each file and displays the statistics columns. (the number of deleted, unmonasteries, non- white and white conflicts.) The full analysis is slower than a simple binding analysis, and considerably slower when they are applied to files which will not contain text. (give a corresponding anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare a large folder about a long-shaped network, it may be faster to compare only the amendment date and file size. however, this speed advantage does not cost you some degree of security. please be sure to check with caution. this option is outdated in default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to TRUSUE the amendment date. there is no real comparison instead of. the files are identical as the same if they are identical. for example, it can be useful when copying the date of lost. please be treated with caution. this option is outdated in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activates the synchronize mode when two folders are compared and no target folder specified. in this mode, the proposals for merging are selected as selected. also the results of the merging of files are stored in both folders. this option is deactivated in default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, instead of the interrupting the newer file is suggested as action. (this is considered uncertain, because it's knowledge that the other file was not also changed. you should consider this in any case.) This option is deactivated in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder will be replaced by another or deleted, then the original version will be renamed with the .orig extension. if an old backup file with the .orig extension is already deleted. this also applies to the normal concoexistence of single files, not only the merging of single files. this option is turned into default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally the folder-merge-view stays visible with the assembling of individual files; you can move the window with the mouse. if you do not want, you can switch the option directory & Textwindow sharing the main window in the window-menu and switch off on the change between directory & texture between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Probably you prefer to compare a file using double-clicking. however, there are also a corresponding menu entry. you can also install a single file with directly from the merge menu. if you save the result, the status will be completed and the file will not be merged again if you launch the folder.</seg>

<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparent with the help of KIO slaves. KDiff3 uses this for reading files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders for opening that are located on local or remote computers.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with one to a FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax than local files and folders. a few things should you consider:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relative. or.. that is not possible with URLs not possible, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masketed. (# - &gt;% 23, spaces- &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the filesystem on the server, sometimes by the used protocol. there is a brief list of constraints:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it can not be differentiated if a link is displayed on a file or folder. then, a file is accepted as a link-destination. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to edit entitlements or change date. therefore, the entitlements or the change date from the original. (note the option VERTRAUE of the size.) (This is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose is currently being differences-viewer in KDEVELOP. KDEVELOP launches first always the built-in differences. to start KDiff3, press the right mouse button on the differences-viewer and then choose In KDiff3cover from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Usually required & kdiff3; two complete input files. if it is applied as KPart, the input file is in the Unified format. then adopts & kdiff3; the names of the original files from the patch file. then start & kdiff3; the program patch to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Konqueror you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu Preview in - KDiff3Part. please note that this does not work if any of the original files exists. moreover, this is unreliable, when the original files have changed since the generation of the patch.</seg>
<seg id="2428">When it is executed when part is executed, it only supports the comparing of two files, a very small toolbar and menu. the merging or the balance of folders will not be supported in the KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and KDiff2 (now Heist es Kompare) there are already. moreover, the name KDiffuser already pointed out that it can lead together as the program diffuse 3 from the diff-tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I already use GPL programs very long and have learned a lot by going into the sources of other programs. this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone this path or going to go so.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You have compiled the program from the sources and the configure script probably will not be the correct prefix to KDE. in the default, KDE can not find the resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find further information on this subject.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines are usually treated as identical; however, if only a non-white sign is different, the line is treated as not the same. if similar lines are, next to each other, this is not coincidence but this does not take advantage of the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor opens for any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends. however, this important information is lost, however, when the result is simply saved as text file, and it is too much effort to design a separate file format that could store this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort for this was too big. you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C. to process larger quantities of text should be used by another editor.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text is suddenly lt; no src lins; appeared and the text cannot be deleted. what does that mean and how can this be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; used already many colors to lift out differences. even more floating would be confusing and lacks the purpose. use this for an alternative editor.</seg>

<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, you need to reread the folder to these options to the folder with the function Update.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">There are only entries displayed, the differences do not show that identities will not already be copied into the target folder. if the target folder does not already contain, they are lacking in a later program version, This option is deactivated in default version.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to choose the source with the label A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the lines are attached from the corresponding window to the end of the selected group in the result window (if the lines are already present), they will be removed by clicking on the button.</seg>

<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it may be necessary to reduce the proportions of & kde; at sound-sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should be aware of what places a mouse-click without effect stays: the clicking on the neutral ingredients of windows or on places in the browser window that does not constitute a link, does not cause unloaded reactions. you can therefore use the mouse at such places until you want to use them again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">When your mouse rusted, you should clean your mouse. it's usually pretty easy. the trick is that you can not only clean the mouse ball, but also the roles that come with the mouse ball in touch.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First, you have to take out the hemisphere. as this happens, your mouse is different from mouse to mouse. however, it should be quick to see if you see the underside of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have the ball away, you need to see the ball. these are located on the sides of the ches, into which the ball was used. the dirt and the soiling can easily merge with a flat blade or the heap-cats.</seg>

<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; use other window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution to this problem is that you can execute a mouse click. this is the status of & kmousetool; return and you can continue to work as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: when you enter text tries to execute & kmousetool; continue to run mouse clicks and removes the cursor to another place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor to place where you want to have it. but you can no longer run the mouse on a neutral area of desktop. so there can be a different mouse click pondering. sure zones for the mouse-cursor are unloaded. secure zones for the mouse-cursor are & eg; the gray areas for the toolbar and menus and the cover lines of windows.</seg>

<seg id="2522">Use the smart slide not only if you just start using & kmousetool; select text instead the following: execute the mouse button pressed, while you move the mouse cursor to the other end of the text and enter the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. thus, each mouse button pressed, when & kmousetool; the mouse button suppresses a sound like a mouse click. so you can use the smart panning also without the audible mouse click. but this requires some practice.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & kmousetool; use the Xtest extension for & X Window; that should be on most system already the case.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse clicks is only available if the system has a soundcard and speaker and that is correctly arranged.</seg>

<seg id="2622">To understand the working methods of filters, it is important to know how the program "Speech dispatcher" with a text works. & kton; differs four kinds of texts.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The output from Screen Readers has the highest priority. it will be predrawn to all the other supplements and holds these orders. if the output of the screen reader is previewed, the orders are repeated.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important news such as & eg; Processor will be too hot. a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders are continued after the warning of warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">News have the next level priority. a message rupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that can be used. whilst you & eg; a long text on a website can be read, you can see with & kmouth; someone who just enter the room. & kde; notifications are also news. read about this.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text messages. each order you encounter from the carton is a text order. KSayit is an example of an application that uses text orders. text messages are meant for the output prolonged lyrics, which have no special urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four order types are processed in queue, with the exception of the output of Screen Readers. if an application sends the output of a screen header, while & kton; just such a reads, this issue is halted and terminated.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First, you have to know that filters will never be applied to the output of Screen Readers. you will be applied to regular warnings, messages and text messages as well as on & kde; messages.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filter edit the text and pass it on to the next filter. at the moment there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are executed as modules. in the future there can be further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">String files replacing parts of a text by other text. the related parts can either give you either as words or as regular expressions. & kton; used by text or for reformatting of messages from & conversation; or & kmail; to be in a better comprehensible form.</seg>

<seg id="2634">Each of these different filters are adjustable to which he is applied to a voice version. if the filter does not agree, he will not pass the text unchanged to the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">When a text order, a message, warning or a & cde; sent, it is processed by all the activated filters supplied on the page below. the filter is processed in order in the list from top to bottom.</seg>

<seg id="2639">Enter a name for your filter. this name can be chosen arbitrarily, it only needs to be different from the names of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the character set in column and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column set. the list is shown in the sequence shown from top to bottom.</seg>

<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is a W3C standard to select text for the control of voices, the volume, volume, sex, and audio levels. also marks for controlling the pronunciation, for example abbreviations. SSML is a part of the preference. SSML is a part of the VoiceXML specification, another W3C standard.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently supported & kton; SSML can only partly and only in the basic functions. the following restrictions are available:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You have to install the Rab _ diphone voice (british male) because this is the default voice which the festival used in the output of SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If the settings for speed or tonight in the Festival configuration dialog box does not set up to 100nbsp;%, SSML text is usually very monoton.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and typeslimitless filter (SDB-filter). SBDs subdivided text in individual phrases. thus, you can also proceed to the map, not all the text order. in addition, you can also pre-jump off or stop and break down even if the language synthesizer do not directly support this.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you can see the proposition-boundless filter. at the first start of & kton; it is automatically set up as a precondition to add a scratching filter. you can change its settings or add more proposiitless filter, but we will be disbanded from it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The easiest way to get to know the furnaces selection by way of trying out. place on the map-selection orders, which spokesman can be chosen. turn out some properties and check how to choose the selection of the microphone. in addition, you need to have set more than one speaker, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& kton; then fast with reading can begin, since only the first phrase needs to be processed and not the whole text block, which can take very long,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can then stop orders on the map, even if the voice synthesizer this function is not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons the normal set-boundless filter is automatically set up if you start kttsmgr for the first time. it cannot be deactivated, just change anything at this filter, unless you know what you do.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Satzengestion filters compare text with a regular expression for satzinger and add a tab (decimal number 8) to the filter limits (tab) before filtering is automatically removed from the text (tab). note that the default-volume production system retains the character.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD-Filter will never be used on & kde; messages (krere), warnings, messages or the output from Screen Readers.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed from verses the normal set-boundless filter, you can insert them again by loading the file standard _ sbdrc.</seg>
<seg id="2736">On the map-card spreads, you can overwrite the spokesperson for the application. the map map will be shown when</seg>
<seg id="2737">Use of the standard speakers (the top on the map map speaker). in other words: there are no spokesperson properties.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Use of the most passable spokesman, who has not delete or edit the properties of a furnished speaker. if you choose the settings of the microphone, select & kton; this spokesperson choose. otherwise, the spokesperson, which corresponds to the most commonly agreed properties.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method to enter the desired spokesperson by clicking on one of the buttons below.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Choose the qualities of the desired microphone. if this feature does not play a role, you do not give anything.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Highlight this checkbox if the property has priority over other properties. you can also set several markings here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor in understanding the issue is, it will always be treated as a priority feature. the only case in which you might want to specify the attribute language is especially if you know that a certain application text is sent in a different language than that in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all properties in the area of speaker, which corresponds to the shortest of the following, click on the selection below and then use on speaker, which corresponds to the shortest of the following.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case 0 is zero for the last text order in queue. you can also specify a order number. (without order number the input is required).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Kttsmgr crashes immediately when it is started. I have compiled Debug-support, but I don't get any retraceable.</seg>
<seg id="2746">GStreamer is crashed and mkton; it was terminated. probably you have to register GStreamer 0.8.x is the command GST-register system 0.8. if the problem is not solved, maybe a non-compatible version of GStreamer is installed. you can try to update GStreamer or uninstall.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The audio output via ALSA does not work when I stop using another application music. if I stop a text order, freeze & kton; one. on the & console; appears a message that says: take to open PCM.</seg>
<seg id="2748">On your system, there is the problem that conflicts can occur during ALSA that can prevent a simultaneous opening of multiple PCM devices. notes for possible solutions can be found on the website of the ALSA project (dmix) at www.alsa-project.org.</seg>
<seg id="2749">I have downloaded an additional voice for Festival from the internet. I installed it and I can use them at the festival, but kttsmgr indicates that voice.</seg>
<seg id="2750">Add the new voice in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / kttsd / festivalint / Voices. as a guide you can use the other entries. if this is successful, please send a patch along with the & URL; on which you found the voice to the developers.</seg>
<seg id="2751">On the map Audio there is a setting speed. so that this works, the program must sox installed and be foolishable via the ambient variable PATH. some Synthesizer modulation like Festival Interactive offer yourself on the map parameter for speaker setting up an attitude towards speed. depending on the chosen voice this is active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The settings for the microphone speed are ignored if & kton; & HTML; prereads. (that is because the HTML has its own tags, with which the speed is controlled.) Deactivate either the filter for the conversion of & HTML; according to & XML; (see) or, if you are completely brave, change the .xsl file of the & HTML; -according to SSML OEML, and insert the speed down.</seg>
<seg id="2753">I don't understand that websites with a female voice can be read before. I have set a female Festival Speaker, but & kton; reads the websites with a male voice.</seg>
<seg id="2754">At Festival 1.95 beta, the day sable gender does not seem to work. with this festival, the XSL file rejects the XSL file for converting SSML to Saber-tags. the same applies for the VOICE-tags.</seg>

<seg id="2836">For this case, the installation of Qt and & kde; not, but in addition, the development of development with libraries and other things are needed.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is only recommended by experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetworkconf; the following commands should do this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information about basic network technology is given, on the second part discussed from & knetworkconf; Modified configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This area can not replace more knowledge about IP networks. in this appendix, only basic information on the inclusion of the PC is conveyed into a small (home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Currently, IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 has never found great spread. from IPv6, it is expected to continue in the near future. this description is currently based on the widespread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is to assign which IP-address of a network interface is. in alien networks, at & eg; workplace is the response point, which is a valid IP address or if available, can only be used as DHCP. in any case, the IP address can not be chosen arbitrary.</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up a separate small (home) network, the IP address should be chosen especially for this purpose to avoid IP address conflict with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded to the Internet, therefore its arbitrary use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks usually addresses in the field of 192.168.1.1 up to 192.168.1.254. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 calculators.</seg>
<seg id="2845">Additionally, the network mask is usually set on 255.255.255.0 so that all computers are on the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the Second-called Loopback address (localhost = your own machine). the default route is required for IP routing.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The IP address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine. normally, the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to an own so-called Loopback interface, which works as a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this section you will find the configuration files that are connected by & knetworkconf; and where they are stored in different distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes dynamically changed for DSL connections, so that it is not surprising when in case of active DSL connections to a different content than hated there.</seg>

<seg id="2894">Before a tape can be used, it must be done by & kdat; that can occur in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; spult the band back and reads the pre-thrilling information of the tape. recognize & kdat; the predicted on the tape do not, you will be asked if the band should be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Detects & kdat; the incident, it searches for the fitting index on your record. can this not be found, you will be asked if the Bandindex will be newly created.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything went smoothly, the symbol changes for belt drive to indicate that the band was integrated. in the status bar a corresponding message appears. the content of the tape can now be searched through out of the entry for the band.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In front of the withdrawal of the gang, first the integration must be solved. there are three methods in order to achieve this.</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; returns to the tape by changing the symbol for the tape, that the inclusion for the band was solved and displays a corresponding notification in the status bar. the band can now be changed without danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a band can be used by & kdat; it must be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A band-cards must be formatted before you can be used to save data. this procedure does not advance the formatting of its use, this must happen before you can formatted a band before using & kdat; formatted. floppy disks tend to be formatted a formatting of the case preceding, DAT-drives, but not.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the belt name and the capacity, & kdat; with the formatting of the gang. all the data on the tape are lost. after completion of the formatting, the band is automatically integrated and ready to use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you encounter the backup process, you must select the files to be assured, that can occur in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. it is saved only this file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Select a profile profile in the tree. only those files are stored in the profile.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in the local file tree with one tick. only the selected files and / or subfolder will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Please click with the right mouse button on the local file tree and select in the menu bar.</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup has been introduced, the dialog opens up settings for backup. in this dialog you can even check the selected files and change the settings for backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">If you have confirmed the settings, the dialog displays the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive. it is only checked the selected file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Select files in one of the archives in the entry for the band with one tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the test process was started, the dialog displays adjustments for check. in this dialog you can once again check your choice and change the working folder for the review.</seg>

<seg id="2915">Before you can initiate the reproduce, the files you need to be recovered. this can be made in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives, which belong to the entry for the belt drive. only the selected file or subfolders will be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the requested files from one of the archives with one tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be recovered.</seg>

<seg id="2920">If you have confirmed the settings for restoration, the dialog displays the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it proves to be necessary to create the bandindex file using the bandcontent. this process deletes all existing index files for this band. you can create the index on two types of the tape:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This allows a backup profile with the straight selected files and standard settings. you can carry out the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working folder in which the backup shall take place. the list of retrieved files will be automatically updated according to the selected work folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders specified under locking files, only those files are stored on the same filesystem, such as the folder. folders that are on other filesystem, you can enter separately under backup files. each entry is viewed from tar independent of the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform an incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used since the last incremental backup, only the files backed up since then changed.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file that is used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file in front of the call of tar. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is set up for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of buttons files & gt; and rushed; files was not yet fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set the settings on the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The full path to the device file for belt drive (normally / dev / tape). this path must refer to the non-remediator version of the belt.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If this attitude is active, transmits & kdat; before the band is mounted the command line load on the drive. with some drives this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Is the option switched on, tries & kdat; the accusation to block the belt drive. maybe this setting does not work at all corners.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is switched on, while solving the integration of & kdat; automatic the band unmounted. use this option not on floppy streaming.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Is the option switched, trying to change & kdat; the hardfull block size for belt drives. not all drives support variable blockcars. no matter if this attitude is active or not, you need to communicate & kdat; in any case the block size for your bandwidth.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat; a band formatted, write it to the beginning of the banknote. this file should occupy only one memory block on the tape. the content of the file is composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(N Byte) The band-ID. the format of this character string is ar: seconds, with invoke the full name of the system is, on which the volume has been formatted. seconds is the number of seconds passed since the time has been formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The Band-ID will be used to locate a file with the same name in the folder $HOME / .kdat /.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the tape are pure tar archive, which can be managed directly with & GNU; - tar. even other tar versions should work as long as it is not a incremental backups.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the content of a backup block. this symbol is only active if a band is involved.</seg>
<seg id="2940">& kss.log; is a & kde; viewer for system protocols. the program is for inexperienced users who can not know where you can obtain information about your system, or where the system uses different protocol files; experienced users with quickly access to information about problems related to their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& kss.log; helps users to understand what your computer is in the background. the task of cooperating system log; is a simplified representation of the protocol-files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who can not know where you can obtain information about your system or where the system sets the various protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & ksystemlog; experienced users with quickly access to information about problems that occur on their server. & ksystemlog; therefore tries to provide some advanced features with which help the protocol-files of certain programs can be filtered and evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 owns and works.log; a number of useful features. among other things include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of protocol files, for the format of the syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other features are also included and are explained in the other chapters of this handbook.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you see in the following screenshot displays & kss.log; functions provided with their help the individual protocol lines of a protocol-file is easily filtering and sorting. the different options for sorting and filters are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After starting the start-system log; first of all the main protocol-file of the system - the system protocol. will not be displayed, and it opens up instead of its small news item, so you have a system container log; so you have the log files under Linux usually in the folder / var / log, for the normal user usually do not have permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filtering bar to filter after a selected criterion or a specified character set. in the default setting, the file list contains next to the filter the entry. then a protocol-line will only be displayed when the columns are included in the filter set of the filter.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select another entry at this point. select for example in the protocol-file system protocol, then select the column process, and carry out the name of a process, so shows you & kss.log; all protocol lines are sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is activated in default settings and helps you see the important protocol lines. log-lines of level error are shown with a distinctive color as a protocol-lines of the level warning. the colored display of protocol lines can be converted into dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Just want to display certain process (e.g. in the system protocol or in the Cron-protocol), so you can examine the process identification (PID) in the column process. this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a particular instruction such as the start of the Samba server. in this case you use Filterbar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can jump the option to add new lines in the context menu of the main window, in order to show all new added protocol lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& kss.log; allows to use multiple protocol files in seperate subwindows. to open this function, use the entries in the menu window to open additional window windows, select in the menu a protocol to display.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website to http: / / kss.log.org. Dort you will find more information on the sources of sources of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& kss.log; can also be found in the following folder of & kde; Subversion archive: kss.log; in & kde; -archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to the & kde; System V init Editor, more known (and in the following also as named) as & ksysv;. this section holds a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv;</seg>
<seg id="2957">The V init system develops rapidly to the standard for control of the program starts at the use of the system in the & Linux; and therefore because it is easier to use, powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further into historical aspects (e.g. because I know nothing about it: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important, because maybe someone might try to recover a machine on System V init without having a reinstall and reformatting. therefore, you must see that the old init was removed from there if there was there one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV init also differs from the BSD init that the configuration files in a subfolder of / etc are instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.d. Dort you will find rc.sysinit and the following other folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically you need a script for any system service to start the system or change to another Runlevel. system services include such things like network, NFS, & sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things like setserial that is run only once. such views belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should take part in / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems do this file even if there is actually not much use for it. you can also run a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to carry out something with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel looks for different places in the program init and starts the first that he finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The standard Runlevel is in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can throw a look into the second column and probably will notice that the default level-level 3 is. if you want to change it, then you can restore / etc / inittab of hand and change the 3. if you have something enrolled, then you will repair your system restart and perform the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the right scripts? if you ls -l type in rc3.d, then you probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there is no right files in this folder. instead, each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the directory init.d.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How does and stop init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is so written that it accepts an argument as start and stop. you can actually start this script from hand at the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the one K includes, the script is called with the argument stop, the script is called with the argument.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people would like to establish a simple way of working machinery for many reasons. I could & eg; a server Runlevel, which can only httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc., I could also have a user -Runlevel, the & eg; & kdm;, network & etc; starts.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult since the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or other pointers is simple to not trivial, simply drag an entry in the area of the availability system services to one of the six round-level to start it at this level (or to stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also change scripts between Runleveln or change the position within a level by changing it elsewhere. this will only happen if they draw an entry from the range of the availability system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are postponed when you choose them in a new section. to just select it to a new Runlevel, you must choose from the menu Edit or from the context menu, even if the same entry has previously existed in the target area of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case you have to edit the sorting of the surrounding entries before you can once again try to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently there is no way to reproduce entries that were thrown into the trash. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tabulator button to enable the different work areas (availables system services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 stop & etc;) and the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To postpone entry into another Runlevel, move it to the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and paste it into the desired Runlevel with inserting (Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the variety number or the name of an entry manually, press the tab button to switch the properties dialog. connect the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to release the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of the account amount, all entries in the menu will require a confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. default settings are performed in the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc). if they are available from & ksysv; reproduced. changes to preferences will be stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with the standard-Runleveln and now the machine starts resistant to date. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the standard Runlevel on a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services provided with & ksysv; for execution under Runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you use & Suse; or Delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc, which are only available in this distribution. please read the details in the manual of your distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way how system services can be started in these distributions, but does not simplify the configuration of the proprietary embody programs of this distribution, but does not correspond to any standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an expansion of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you use a different distribution: check if all configuration files are available, which are required by the respective system service (and also whether they are in the correct directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) just terminate without notice when their configuration files are not present or false.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The meaning of the & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use a different distribution, please send me information about the Runlevel, so that this manual can be added.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To begin with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of & kuser;</seg>
<seg id="2991">Once you have made changes, you have to save it. either use the appropriate icon of the toolbar or the entry saved in the menu file.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two card cards, the user interface and the user groups. for editing you choose the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry. it appears the dialog User, or Group properties.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some boxes are shown only if you have advanced system settings. only if you have advanced system settings, a box-card will be created on which you can make individual settings. further card cards seem to appear, if shadow passcodes, or for example / etc / master.passwd as in BSD countermixes are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The card-card password is displayed, if shadow passcodes, or for example / etc / master.passwd as in BSD -Unices are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This carton card appears only if for at least a one-connected filesystem (Quota) is enabled and initialized (recognizable at the file quota.user / quota.group on the filesystem). here you can change parameters for each user, whereas the space restrictions are stored in KB:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each file system. the current file system is selected by means of the field file system with space-file system</seg>
<seg id="2997">The card-card groups informs about the group members of the selected users. the standard group, which the user is heard, you will find in the field of primeval group. furthermore, the user can become a member in other groups by highlight this in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The dialog properties tab includes a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select Add from the menu user or group or click the appropriate adding button. the Edit or delete the selected user or the selected group is analog.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module, you can install the LILO boot, remove and change the time up to the booting of the standard operating system, remove the standard operating system, remove, change and remove more.</seg>
