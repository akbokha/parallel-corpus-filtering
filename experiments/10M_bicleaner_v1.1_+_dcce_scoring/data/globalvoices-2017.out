although I visited the US for at least once a year , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is exceptionally large .
as many of my generation I grew up with American films , led to American music , American authors read and operated his sport .
in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I became mainly because of an American film journalist .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gray Go@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , a fear@@ less re@@ por@@ ter with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts described as Jura Stu@@ dentin der tig@@ er@@ der@@ ous conspir@@ acy , the Supreme Federal Criminal Tribunal with stra@@ ins that had his interest to occupy .
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; free after method Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was , as if that is the absolute truth , everything else is , it &apos;s what I want to make with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the USA had only been reinforced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; America is the only country in which I ever lived , whose variety is as welcoming as you can always be that you are and it &apos;s easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I even had a very cold love letter written about his great@@ ness .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
a lot has been written by xen@@ opho@@ bia and racism this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his asc@@ ension is for me as he embr@@ aces with his bott@@ ling .
he never holds behind the mountain behind the mountain as you say so beautiful .
he tells exactly what he thinks of what a former colleague is expressed , and explains publicly its cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Latin@@ os , Af@@ ro@@ American and women .
nevertheless the people have responded to his statements and voted for him .
the 13 million votes , which he won with the Republi@@ can elections , was the highest number ever achieved by the party of nom@@ ini@@ zed can@@ did@@ at .
I was speech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support these big@@ ry person , asked me ?
I could not get g@@ ump and did not get to know his voters with the people I met in Phoenix during my time .
as for example my Professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program that record people from all over the world , a deep belie@@ ver Man with whom I could talk about Islam and his past .
also , separ@@ ating m@@ umps is not associated with the Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the present editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ er &quot; in fact .
Bh@@ ut@@ a and I had hit us with our shared love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the &quot; Phoenix Sun . &quot;
m@@ umps intoler@@ ance is also in contrast to gener@@ osity that I lived at Sandy B@@ ahr , who fought for life long , and her husband Dave , my host family who like their son .
she also fits her to the dedication of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ it , who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace to me and my colleagues helped to get used to the complexity of American life .
then there were Andrew Mari@@ ey , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wis@@ er advice has helped me much at my career .
these people and those by em@@ bo@@ died values deep@@ ened my love of America .
as Tr@@ ump its way to the nom@@ ini@@ zed re@@ publi@@ can presidential , they sent me a grip and the counter@@ part to his limited vision of America .
but it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
on 8 November 2016 , over 50 million Americans , mostly past@@ ure , the Presidency of a man , despite - or perhaps due to its cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people .
the con@@ frontation with the idea that people voted for ump because they either shared his racism and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism , or because they were prepared to over@@ look these things , broke me almost the heart .
perhaps it is unfair to describe the ump @-@ voters as a cr@@ assi@@ sts .
the people to arrange , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is super@@ ficial and respect@@ ful and indicates an in@@ ability to understand those in a different way and think .
it shows the people that their worries and fears about the h@@ ectic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
could it be that these voters , of which most know are , for dre@@ ump , because they would like to reg@@ ain control of a country that she dis@@ ap@@ sed ?
in other words , they might want to say that in this America they are still important ?
perhaps .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick who commented the cru@@ el decision to desc@@ end a man who look with cont@@ emp@@ t on those that look differently from it .
this &quot; whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( An@@ m. d . ) . : as much as &quot; dis@@ ation of the wh@@ ites against all other ethnic &quot; ; voc@@ abulary from white in touch on the wh@@ ites and wh@@ i@@ pl@@ ash , as the great Van Jones int@@ ri@@ fied , has made exactly what America has done so great .
millions of people around the world appreciate the American Ideal - no matter whether the my@@ th or reality , it is still a powerful idea - which faith or background you may have always like , America is every welcome .
for this land chose as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose story , as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible .
with the choice of Donald Tr@@ umps , however , there is a huge part of the white missionary of America this promise and says : to hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole concept of plur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is again at the ruin , they say .
in all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Kh@@ an , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a manifestation for Hill@@ ary Clinton had Mr. Kh@@ an exchange @-@ change with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would have my son , Captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Kh@@ an .
the crowd answered with a lau@@ t@@ strong &quot; No ! &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; bro@@ ll@@ ed the crowd .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have Latin@@ os a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; answering it .
do A@@ fr@@ o Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if anyone who is not like you , a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he received a voc@@ ative and lou@@ dly strong &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; NE@@ IN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Kh@@ an concluded with the words : &quot; God is thanks , Mr. Tr@@ ump , is that not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was informed .
the land , for which his son was fallen , sent him a message .
that is now Tr@@ umps country , told the message .
and all the people who look like Mr. Kh@@ an , could not find a place in this new America .
and this breaks me my heart .

that the music that is played in both places not only the lives of children , but also a very close contact with ...
music which lives with the waste
Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large gar@@ bage dump , only 16 km south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial city which is very popular among tourists -@@ but worlds away from nearby pre@@ qu@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
for some years now , the La B@@ anda de m@@ ú@@ sica ( Musik@@ ban@@ de ) in the municipality : one of the children and adults of the existing Symphony Orchestra , which has found an opportunity for over@@ coming poverty .
a Musik@@ schule with 100 students is for the municipality of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the community , which is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico , is known for their drugs abuse and the ties of ties .
however , this changed after a random encounter with a French pilots who started a musical project and the youth offered so a rare hop@@ eless@@ ness .
the young band members take their obligations towards the music group extremely seriously , means the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
once they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the narrow roads to meet their great passion .
they come always with sh@@ iny and with sh@@ iny eyes and play in the Tru@@ bel you learn day for day trumpet , trombone , pic@@ colo , clarinet , oboe , flute , Wald@@ horn , Pau@@ ke , Bon@@ g@@ os and the Con@@ ga to play .
music from Mü@@ ll
more than 7,@@ 000 kilometers south of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero , the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura - a village that is practically at the largest gar@@ bage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments that are made of recycl@@ ed waste materials :
music with restored instruments , which consist of local firm waste materials , made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ e@@ ura , where the recycling under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez started to turn parts of the crash into instruments .
the instruments im@@ itate violins , viola , dam@@ ar , gu@@ it@@ ars , fl@@ utes , saxophone , trumpets , tromb@@ ones and percussion , all made out of the rub@@ b@@ ish .
the reper@@ toire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Be@@ at@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article in the Los Angeles Times F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez , a local soci@@ ologist and the musician instructor of the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura , to the beginning of the early days :
first , it was very difficult since we had no place to rehear@@ se and we had to teach at the same place , the kids had no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live with their children .
this changed when F@@ avi@@ o was shown something that he had never seen before : one out of waste produced violin .
today there is a whole orchestra , which plays on instruments from repeated material and that is called The Recy@@ cl@@ ed Orchestra .
a documentation called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic gar@@ bage dump ) draws the musical performance on :
the world generates around a billion tons of tr@@ ash each year .
those who live with him and of him are the poorest countries like the people in Cat@@ e@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here she turn him into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with his inspiring spect@@ acle from Mü@@ ll @-@ To @-@ Music around the world .
the orchestra has even played his music against Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team work can fight against illegal fishing
photo © Fish @-@ i Africa - a project that is fighting the wild illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Bry@@ ce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reported on international , practic@@ ed solutions for environmental problems .
the re @-@ release occurs within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for sharing content .
in West Africa , at that time , the ship was already known in Leb@@ anese waters illegal fishing , before it sear@@ ched the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were accordingly more inten@@ tioned and little gen@@ ei@@ ve to welcome a legislative bre@@ aker of this kind on their co@@ asts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the com@@ s , Moz@@ ambi@@ que and the Seych@@ elles mobili@@ zed themselves quickly against the ship . they ref@@ used to give him one of their har@@ b@@ ours and so@@ jour@@ ned to give him a fishing cre@@ ational .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister has been surrounded by countries that you just had to do everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rec@@ alls Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a leading employee of the Ken@@ yan fisher@@ man Authority . he is part of a team that discovered the ship at the time and followed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : it was not able to catch fish there .
ultimately , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Lib@@ eria , because of the pill@@ age of the land .
the core of this initiative , which crimin@@ fies and protects resources , Fish @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the N@@ RO Stop illegal F@@ ishing ( Il@@ legal fisher@@ y ) .
the members of this network are besides Somalia and Madagascar the six countries , who had driven the prime minister out of their waters at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are equal and working together . they exchange information out and stand on each other in where it is to illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Tony Long , Head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable trust project . this project provides Fish @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is defined by definition : what is tr@@ apped , is hidden that because it is extremely difficult to escal@@ ate . thus , the illegal fishing is a prime minister of survival of regions .
by di@@ visible mis@@ emp@@ t of existing laws , by which certain habitats and species are to be protected , can harm the illegal fishing of ecos@@ ystems that have been a delicate balance .
however , while actions against illegal fishing was once formed by bureaucr@@ atic hur@@ d@@ les , and also through the be@@ eck@@ er@@ emp@@ o , with the information between individual countries , so the promotions happen today in real time , with trac@@ eable on Fish @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there , the individual countries can interact with each other for example lists of existing lic@@ ences , news on verd@@ ant activities or details that have noticed or experienced during a long@@ term perspective .
Fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very attentive when they move around the open sea using satellite data .
this allows the authorities to mark ships that f@@ ishes in ver@@ ot@@ ene areas . also , as susp@@ ects the routes that a ship invites its finished fish on the way to other ships .
ideally , such studies may show whether the participating ships have a fish license , where they were on the road and eventually , whether they have a criminal law .
countries that are against illegal fishing , can be found on the basis of this information then acceptance of such ships in their ports . and that means that the ships will not sell their charges . and that they can even be forced to enter pen@@ alties , as in the case of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then there is significant financial losses for the owner , which means the illegal fishing of fishing does not pay any more financially . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that &apos;s what we want to achieve , &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , Senior Director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consultant company that advoc@@ ates for the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and thereby supports Fish @-@ i .
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to attract valued 20 million USD to abandoned sales , the eight members of the network H@@ ISH @-@ i each year lost due to illegal fishermen that penet@@ rate into East African waters .
Eastern Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una @-@ fish species , present because of the region &apos;s commercial fishing from all over the world . among these also those illegal fishing .
among their practices inter alia , such as the sailing under false flag , counter@@ f@@ eit license papers , indication of fan@@ tasi@@ es , the f@@ usi@@ oned species and the fish in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are target@@ ing the lack of international co @-@ operation and make up the weaknesses of any organised control system &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier , a ship was illegal and a country could then say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You dar@@ ed my port not to run &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but another country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ ome to me &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; and this is precisely this legal gorge , trying to close Fish @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
until now the closed front works .
since its inc@@ eption , Fish @-@ i has participated in more than 30 exam@@ inations .
it has criminal networks exposed to split counter@@ f@@ eit licenses in Tanzania . there were ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has been persec@@ uted and found j@@ ven ships .
due to its cooperation with Inter@@ pol , the International Authority on the fight against crime , Fish @-@ i may share information on illegal fishing over great distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us pretty far into the networks organized crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it builds a system , the Fish @-@ i is supposed to help susp@@ end ships conc@@ essions .
photo with kind permission of Fish @-@ i Africa .
Fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is always updated , also helps the illegal ships dis@@ agree with it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishing use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Ch@@ ef@@ analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ g@@ g Mat Tracking , one N@@ RO , which also deals with fisheries data and Fish @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships used for instance their automatic identification systems , with which they can no longer be processed by satellite .
Cop@@ eland helps to build a system that connects different information levels . it aims to help fish @-@ i to find criminal vessels with bigger precision .
a model program
but Fish @-@ i &apos;s team can actually influence African nations to the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently , Sky@@ Truth can set up with Google and the marine protection organisation Oc@@ e@@ ana the platform Global F@@ ishing Watch : a platform that offers satellite data , and by means of which the position of each trac@@ table shipping can be displayed worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together with the neighb@@ ors to get a better picture of who , what is doing - this is simply sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here &apos;s a chance for countries to unite and to b@@ undle their resources for investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project to run in which a global system allows the persecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that Fish @-@ i &apos;s activities do not only feel crimin@@ als , but also sh@@ opp@@ ers .
ships used to conf@@ isc@@ ated earlier without any license and hardly have to reck@@ on with consequences , now they know that they are observed .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries involved in Fish @-@ i are now offering a 33 % increase of fisheries worldwide since fishing boats buy more licenses .
after Fish @-@ i Somalia had helped , Gre@@ ko 1 , the insp@@ ectors found there on board tow@@ ing , whose use is prohibited .
photo with kind permission of Fish @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries notic@@ ing this success . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa annually , several hundreds of millions of dollars annually disappear by illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are six countries to come together , to the so called West Africa Task Force . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they are fighting for illegal fishing , based on the same model like Fish @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with safety is the target , even more such initiatives and structures also arise in other regions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , Fish @-@ i &apos;s youngest member of Somalia was on his first big tri@@ umph : in October there was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was on the wrong flag . and not only was the ship used without a license , and were used as opposed networks used by now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship was also penet@@ rated in ver@@ ot@@ ene waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the taking of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they fight against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Fish @-@ i , this is another success of many . and at the same time the proof that such a particular , collabor@@ ative working method works in the entire cosmos . Emma Bry@@ ce is fre@@ eing professional journals and lives in London . there she writes on the subject of environment , technology and nutrition .
their articles appear in the Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , the New York Times and the Guardian . location in Venezuela is moving further : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of con@@ quer the country . &quot;
the road movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of severe demonstrations .
they apply as a protest against the decision of the government , the referendum to stop the President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

after the Government of Venezuela , the Government of Venezuela had rejected the request of the opposition to a referendum , opened the Venezu@@ el@@ ans , in their eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country delivered to the Le@@ ere , gathered down on the roads .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the back of Venezuela ) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them .
the debate is also guided in other parts of the country - among other things in low@@ land Bar@@ inas , in the Andes @-@ regions of Méri@@ da and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , located in the central @-@ north of the county of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and at the Isla Margar@@ ita in the State of Nu@@ eva Esp@@ arta .
the political and economic situation of the country is continually wor@@ sen@@ ing what is noticeable in the everyday life of dental vene@@ ers by a ak@@ uten lack of food and drugs .
many representatives of the opposition saw in the Am@@ t@@ sen@@ ti@@ fication of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro the chance for a fundamental shift ; ultimately , however , the post@@ ure of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official agencies .
Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , co @-@ acting at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ izes in its latest article the context of the governing board :
within the framework of the social , political and economic crisis , in which the infl@@ ation@@ ary and bureaucr@@ atic burden of the highest around the world ( the inflation rates is estimated to be 500 % to the annual financial statements ) and in which a serious and extensive lack of food and medicine was considered the only way to return to the country to con@@ quer its institutional structures and to close a new governance .

the first demonstration in the framework of the programme programme &quot; Die Re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; took place on Wednesday , October 26 .
the pictures of the mar@@ ches which are published in real time are evidence of the overwhelming participation of the people in numerous areas of the country , but also struggles with polic@@ emen as well as advoc@@ ates of the government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most frequently shared images shows an demonstr@@ ator who calls through the protective signs : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cry of this Venezu@@ el@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on Twitter are pictures , which tell of arguments , as well as reports of repres@@ sion and abuse .
especially large waves hit the news about police repres@@ sion in the centrally located city of Marac@@ ay .
there the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local Cathedral to protect themselves according to the police and the armed advoc@@ acy of the government .
hours later they could leave the cathedral again but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country some prot@@ esters sear@@ ched to keep the police forces , including these women in the An@@ den@@ State T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira :
the women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira do not carry the tube because you could see anything else , what many nationalities did not have !
meanwhile , a Info@@ graphic is already making the scale of repres@@ sion per day :
so the dictatorship of the country has supp@@ ressed .
many representatives of the government had ques@@ tioned the validity of the demand for an am@@ ass@@ ination procedure - these have now been demonstrated in the eyes of many by the presence of inn@@ umer@@ able people on the street .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Lab@@ s on this :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ d@@ ado claim that 1 % of the sig@@ nat@@ ures are fal@@ si@@ fied .
here is your am@@ ass@@ ing !
in the street !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others value these protests as a further step in the fight against a government who has done a little against the devast@@ ating economic crisis and would rather be concerned to leave critical voices : &quot; &quot; &quot;
they have taken us so much - but also the fear !
the mar@@ ches always take more of frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported the media , they are to be hungry , to participate in a strike , instead of working or shopping .

this is an adapted version of a interview of Al@@ ejo Gó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was received on 23 August 2016 on D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ inian message page .
the interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to join the atro@@ city in La Perla , a secret prison in the Argentin@@ ean town of Córdoba .
as meanwhile , Qui@@ j@@ ano told Qui@@ j@@ ano now as part of the great La Perla @-@ Ribera process in the province of Cordoba , against his father .
the trial concluded on 24 August 2016 , crimes were examined , which were committed during the Argentin@@ ean military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
starting at the Bür@@ de , the same name as his father bear witness to the brut@@ al militar@@ ism in the prison of La Perla , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough suffered .
34 years of all , he kept the sur@@ rendered for himself .
in the situation back then I believed that was fine .
I felt like a sal@@ ent .
as a child of 15 years you will not notice that you will be manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time I could not know that my father was a th@@ ief , Fol@@ terer and mur@@ derer .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was G@@ end@@ im@@ eri@@ e@@ be@@ am@@ ter . during the Argentin@@ ean military dictatorship of 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , was his father from 1976 to 1978 Dep@@ uty Kom@@ man@@ de@@ ur of the Secret Services Section 141 in the prison La Perla .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano .
dat@@ es@@ ar@@ ming .
but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the op@@ press@@ ors who was indic@@ ted for kid@@ n@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in nearly 100 cases and the ab@@ duction of a 10 @-@ year child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ anos son , a man who had experienced the extent of the atro@@ cities that he had experienced as a boy , and who said before a Federal court against his own father .
his story shows what great power has a parent with his child and how this child chose a path of salvation .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went with us into the sports hall . there I had been wo@@ unded with a boy , the mar@@ tial arts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all called him &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I told my father from him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ white photo and invited me to identify my friend of it .
he said :
you are a Ar@@ sch@@ loch , you have been wo@@ unded to you by one of the ERP .
pass that they will not lead you one day and I must save you .
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ cion@@ ario del Pueb@@ lo , - Revol@@ utionary Volks@@ ar@@ mee - the military arm of the revolutionary workers &quot; party .
therefore he told me to go back to the sports hall . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me , I would be ad@@ ent .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought it would be fine . for this was my father educated .
on the military support , I had to destroy Pap@@ ers who heard the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : University papers , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , Prop@@ ag@@ and@@ amat@@ erial , books , just everything .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there , the prisoners are tor@@ tured &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my father took me a total of four times in La Perla , all in 1976 .
the first and last time he allowed me to wait at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he com@@ man@@ ded me to go . he led me to a bar@@ ac@@ ke , in the cars , furniture , television , refrigerator , etc .
everything about it was st@@ olen .
he gave me a little into a ceiling ceiling , and com@@ man@@ ded me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a great l@@ ump of silver .
on that day I went to the other end of the Bar@@ ac@@ ke , where the st@@ olen objects were put down and kept me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
there , the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I sp@@ elled and saw a colleague on the human being tor@@ tured . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it looked like a field bed and metal @-@ springs .
later , I found that they attached to the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person that was barely cap@@ tiv@@ ated there .
it sel@@ dom a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , ski@@ pped him with water and ch@@ asing it a charge of 220 vol@@ ts into gen@@ itals .

the st@@ ench there was clear ... like a narrow winding .
years later , when my father stood under house ar@@ rest , the same smell came from his room .
I realized the smell immediately and I was clear that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget that smell .
and I asked me , How is it possible that a man can do so much suffering from another ?
&apos;@@ I knew that these people were killed . &apos;
when my father took me for the third time to work , he led me to the entrance of La cu@@ ad@@ ra - in the area where the prisoners were cap@@ tiv@@ ated and har@@ sh@@ y .
he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ u@@ bi &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilians who was also charged in the trial ) and I used the opportunity to throw a look at La cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people were cap@@ tiv@@ ated with the face down - all were cap@@ tiv@@ ated by hands and feet .
in the vicinity of the entrance of k@@ au@@ ded people still on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my Father noted that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what gu@@ ck@@ est thou so , ar@@ re@@ hole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I believed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why have you otherwise brought me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and buried by soldiers and buried .
I know that because my Father told the father of it .
apart from La cu@@ ad@@ ra some rooms were referred to as the office .
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero sle@@ w a man there and sle@@ w .
( according to details given by survi@@ vor@@ s of the civil , Jor@@ ge Rom@@ ero , which was also charged at La Perla @-@ Ribera process , the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) .

the way that you came here is also the way to which they came here .
when you look at the map , see that they took about this path and then were tor@@ tured for the first time .
here her name were changed and they got assigned a number assigned as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization .
when they survived torture , the prisoners were cast into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the arrangement of above came that they should be displ@@ aced .
such was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the imagination of men and the dis@@ appearance of their cor@@ p@@ ses in most cases .
the &apos; war ac@@ ute &apos;
my father brought all sorts of st@@ olen things with home .
back then at the age I had no idea what the &quot; war yield &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was later in the military - I was in the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie - it was clear to me that war lo@@ ot is a bay@@ on@@ et , or perhaps the military signs which one decre@@ ases one enemy .

but if one goes into a house and the fridge , the turn@@ table , clothing , paintings , money ... missing , then this is not a war of war , but V@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I always wonder@@ ed how my father , the leader of the security forces , with this V@@ and@@ alism could with@@ stand .
I do not understand it simply .
I was also officer at the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never per@@ ate to enter into a house and ste@@ al everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do this .
once he called me a crimin@@ als and I said , and thou that you are cars on the street ?
you are not crimin@@ als ?
he explo@@ ded in front of anger , struck me and cri@@ ed :
if you go so far , then I will find you and take you arbitr@@ ary .
for that we need no one else !
that was my father .
I have no single good memory of him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photo of that at that time when I carried a jacket and a wheelchair @-@ swe@@ ater from w@@ ool . both my father made of La Perla .
we were not poor , but he nevertheless brought clothing to home .
at that time , the defense , a fellow @-@ conspir@@ ators would have been to be with this crime . I ref@@ used , no problem , they can lay to me the burden of what they wanted .
I was anyway there to say .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dis@@ appearance of the body is the last &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eu@@ ver@@ ish act &apos; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now , where I am older , I find Reu@@ e .
I have children . when you only have children , you can recognize the value of a life .
one develops on and real@@ ises that it is wrong to kill .
I was even so far to say :
well , you have ex@@ hal@@ ted during the dictatorship people . but what the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
why children kid@@ n@@ ap ?
one day my father brought a girl home with her mother , whose mother was killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl .
I repeatedly asked the question : you were tor@@ tured but why were they killed ?
they could not have been put into prison .
I guess it was just decided to kill these people . but what their cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
had these people not also families where you could pass their eternal rem@@ n@@ ants ?
the cas@@ ing of the body is the final le@@ eu@@ y act , which one can do to a man .
my father told me when democracy was re@@ introduced again , they took machinery to eliminate the eternal remains of the prisoners .
they were tor@@ n and somewhere de@@ ed - no idea , where . &quot; you will never find something , &quot; she said my father .
but something is of course always .
&apos;@@ i saw how you killed people ! &apos;
only to make it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I was even with the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 crimin@@ als - including my Father .
the thought , to display my Father , was created during a conversation , when he was under house ar@@ rest .
I made him sorry for all the atro@@ cities that I had to experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I have never killed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I felt amazed and asked me to what the entire over@@ laid patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; western and Christian feelings &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which they alleg@@ edly defended them were really good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I cri@@ ed :
how can you tell the sow@@ as to me ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you committed evil crimes and you are forced to join me as a child to participate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he re@@ lu@@ te only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Na then zei@@ g me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is exactly what I did .
in 2010 I will be the first ad .
I had finally realized that he was a crimin@@ als .
nobody can imagine that I have bi@@ ased . I finally told my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 at home @-@ rest , still at the end of the process .

&quot; &quot; &quot; a translation error makes older people in Kyoto to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; awesome drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sign with the translation errors in a centre in Kyoto , where one can extend its leadership .
the photo was spread in social media .
elabor@@ ation of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city Kyoto , customers became a newly opened centre in which one can pro@@ long his leadership , last month witnesses of a very special translation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on a sign the Japanese word take hold of it ( bo@@ iling sh@@ a ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; may be mist@@ aken - maybe but also with B@@ ös@@ em &apos;s back@@ gro@@ wers &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as a &quot; fear@@ ful mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was from 1 to 20 September in electronic advertis@@ ements in the entrance area and in the building itself .
edited by Joshua Lev@@ ine in the social media has been divided into the social media .
the error was the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a local residents of Ky@@ ot@@ os , fallen ill . he was also who attentive the local time of places .
the published in Kyoto Kyoto Shim@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that nobody has read the translation correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an ins@@ ult to the elderly and in an international city such as Kyoto simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the incorrect English translation was first removed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ read drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; awesome drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropriate term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ der drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of the pre@@ f@@ ecture Kyoto ap@@ olog@@ ised for the translation errors . furthermore , they explained that the error was already contained in the text and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported as follows on the sorry :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are sorry that older people felt through the in@@ sufficient correction ( the translation ) in our part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online news @-@ dienst J @-@ cast News a bit more detailed by the phenomenon of the &quot; hor@@ ri@@ ble &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
the word &quot; awesome &quot; was denied as an in@@ adequate description of older drivers . according to the police , the percentage of older auto@@ drivers who are involved in accidents , but certainly cause concern .
in the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Kyoto , for example , in the year 2005 1.@@ 9@@ 41 was caused by a total of 19.@@ 460 accidents of sen@@ iors . this corresponds to a percentage of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ i@@ dered sen@@ iors 1,@@ 8@@ 03 by a total of 11.@@ 850 accidents .
with this you rose to 17,@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has declined altogether , the proportion of sen@@ iors caused by sen@@ iors over the same period .
the name does not named re@@ por@@ ter in the version published on Yahoo announced version of article comments on light that show what pre@@ judi@@ ces some Japanese will seem to have apparently against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo about the translation errors received the following comments :
- &quot; Is this ( &quot; fear@@ ful motor@@ ist &quot; ) about not the reality ? &quot;
- &quot; So the translation is actually not at all , or ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t find that this is true translation errors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread in all Asia
translation errors are widely used in Japan and Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a true foundation for these bizar@@ re errors in English .
photo of Flick@@ r @-@ users Andrew .
the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are mani@@ fold .
for translators , one needs two important skills : passive language skills to understand the initial text and to translate active language skills to get it into the target language .
the latter calls for active fi@@ del@@ e@@ tion of target language - something that is case with mother@@ tongue . in general , the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the starting language - native speakers should be .
this should be a French native speakers for example from English into French - not from the French into English .
photo of Flick@@ r @-@ User Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ workers with English as a native language , which might sound translations into English . this may be mis@@ understood as a lack of understanding of the translator , the reasons , or the relatively small number of English speakers that learn Japanese .
some companies that even do not have foreign employees , make translations yet fir@@ med . then the Japanese employee will be judged as the best one to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language knowledge really are .
photo of Flick@@ r @-@ User Karl Baron .
machine translations are also widespread - often with funny results .
the wor@@ r@@ ted and pu@@ zz@@ ling propositions which arise through mechanical translations , show that this technique does not yet replace a human translator . this applies to some languages very special .
some of the strange English phr@@ ases in Japan , including even the pu@@ zz@@ ling bags , often used t @-@ shirts or hand@@ hel@@ ds , are only used for stylish reasons - not to be read or even understood .

translation errors may be either acceptable or at least harm@@ less . but by large companies or by the government who have the means to ensure higher standards , you can expect careful translations .
the city of Kyoto makes use a rep@@ utable source of its translations .
Venezuela : protests and customs measures on the Internet and TV
main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ eg@@ ar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( Frei@@ es Sur@@ fing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to PR@@ EN@@ SA y soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institute for Press and Society ) .
on Fri@@ day@@ tomorrow , April 7 , the Venezu@@ el@@ an internet users that they have no access to the online radio station Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay .
later , other users wrote that the internet pres@@ ences of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV were no longer available .
other online radio stations brid@@ ged recordings of the protests in Caracas , which were organised by op@@ posi@@ tional groups , which the government Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uros .
the protests started in early April after the Supreme Court had dis@@ solved the parliament and took the tasks of the Parliament on the executive and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a Trac@@ er@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection is an@@ gled , and recommended the users , VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that websites of ven@@ ez@@ ol@@ an@@ ic providers have again been blocked .
this is from the side of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with Internet access by popular vene@@ ers , especially in times of un@@ rest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; traditional media has been thinking about protests in 2014 . at that time , the Commission for telecommunications with AT@@ ES and Fin@@ ally , if they continue to report on demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as &quot; call to violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels I registered in @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
surprisingly , that this is more favourable than two litres of li@@ on@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro confirmed later that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay through a pl@@ ess@@ ation of the domain name System ( DNS ) is in@@ accessible , but also two other online radio stations . this also affects the website , which the National Assembly can exceed their meetings .
earlier tut@@ ors of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had to use that local internet service providers make use of a technique , by which the DNS server requests from specific domains are missing .
if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server respon@@ sab@@ ly or denied the request when calling on such a website .
we confirm a DNS @-@ lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third locked channel , the transfer on Thursday , April 6 , set , when the V@@ PI@@ TV Kamer@@ am@@ ann El@@ vis Flores , which was transferred to the protests in Caracas .
Flores was be@@ aten while he was in police .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went back to the show .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it was also reported that the government is regulated the Internet connections : thus the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ ans will continue to keep access to multi @-@ media coverage about the current events in the country .
in Paraguay many girls will get to get a training
Tina Al@@ var@@ enga was a child of Cri@@ ad@@ ita . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today Tina for the rights of children and coll@@ ects witness , other Cri@@ ad@@ itas , who were exactly as they were victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the short@@ ened version of a report by Kur@@ tur@@ al , which is published by Global Vo@@ ices with kind permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series associated with the title &quot; V@@ acas que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ elas que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; F@@ lying cows , dec@@ aying schools &quot; ) performed by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America and re @-@ released .
Tina Al@@ var@@ enga lived eight years in a household where she was not playing with the family who lived there .
shortly before their studies at the university she returned to the house again and heard how the owner of the house full of pride about them spoke . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who became a little , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ enga has never been treated in this house like a daughter .
when she was ten years old , she began to work as Cri@@ ad@@ ita for the family . as Cri@@ ad@@ itas is described in Paraguay that are more than 4@@ 6,000 boys and girls who are comp@@ elled to work to go to school .
the business is quite simple : a large family with little money for@@ give their min@@ der@@ old son or her min@@ der daughter to another , plentiful family . in exchange , the child has eating , a training and a roof over the head .
but what is not mentioned , however , that children must do so many days of house@@ work , who will never be paid and avoid victims of abuse and abuse - and all that is within the context of a contract which one cannot lift .
this as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go stands in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and in spite of numerous complaints from human rights organizations .
after grad@@ uation of her studies , Al@@ var@@ enga worked for some years for an organization dedicated to the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ ad@@ itas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - gathered witness , resear@@ ched and p@@ ran@@ ged .
they tried to name things in the name , because the sense of gratitude that is em@@ vacc@@ inated the Cri@@ ad@@ itas , guaranteed to be silent in general .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ enga .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the one hand , there is the family that her daughter in the belief that they do so their education to improve their position in society and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can make something out of themselves &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to another family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the family , which takes the girl in himself and justi@@ fies its exploitation with faith , that they would give someone a chance that would otherwise no education could get and maybe even star@@ vation .
the victims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
if the girl is ming@@ led , his family will only experience many years later .
sometimes they even learn of it .
in January 2016 , the so far relatively un@@ known phenomenon , which is held at the bor@@ ough of par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , but a face .
as Carolina Mar@@ ín at Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú came to hospital , her body showed too fi@@ er@@ ce fe@@ athers . shortly afterwards she died .
it was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ ad@@ ita in the household of the former Mil@@ itä@@ ran@@ du@@ Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as an official partner in the district .
Mar@@ ín living in her house in V@@ aqu@@ ería , a small village with only 3.000 residents , 250 kilometres to the east of the capital As@@ unci@@ on .
at the end of January 2016 Fer@@ re@@ ira was struck with a stick on Mar@@ ín until they have fat@@ al injury .
this should be the last fun@@ eral in the life of the young girl .
some days later the media reported on the incident .
they stressed that the mur@@ dered child was a Cri@@ ad@@ ita .
organizations like UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the deep in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an society of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go to the death of the girl .
they recorded the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of sla@@ very . &quot;
several do@@ zen people came to protest and demanded that there would be no more Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widely spread in social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay more cows have been registered as children , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compl@@ ained Tina Al@@ var@@ enga &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
without Pap@@ ers it is much easier to hurt the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control , in which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighb@@ ors of married and almost 60 civil society organizations called for a breed investigation into the case .
they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was their Cri@@ ad@@ ita was sentenced to 30 years in prison .
if the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín p@@ aving the case - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay , a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go appears in court .
the everyday life of a Cri@@ ad@@ ita
the Cri@@ ad@@ itas is exploited not only as labor force , they also live isolated from other girls at their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ enga was ten years old when the Far@@ mers who worked in her father , and lost his father his work .
their brothers had to work all and began to sell on the road or on the market swe@@ ets to earn money .
but they went all further to school .
only Tina was sent as Cri@@ ad@@ ita to the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
in her house she worked in Al@@ var@@ enga between four and six hours every day .
at the same time , they had to share the time so that you still remained time to learn .
she stood at five o &apos;clock in the morning and prepared the breakfast for their employer .
for example , they puri@@ fied the fridge , puri@@ fied the living room , pin the furniture and des@@ ig@@ fied the floor .
when the school was at the end , she went back home and had time to learn .
the sooner they were finished with learning , the more free time had it .
but even this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employer .
Al@@ var@@ enga , she had to never hunger , but I also didn &apos;t get un@@ restricted food . &quot; I was allowed to pick up more books from the library of the house@@ wife as food from the fridge . &quot;
the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party that was in power from 1954 to 1989 on the opposition .
at several evenings of the landlord Al@@ var@@ enga , to stand alongside him and editorial notes from Op@@ posi@@ tions@@ zeit@@ ungen , like &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pueb@@ lo . &quot;
he tried to convince them to give no faith in the reports of the official media on the regime of dict@@ ator .
he kept her to be intelligent , but did not pause with her . &quot; the landlord had found someone who list@@ ened , while he spoke about politics , &quot; she says .
&quot; they allowed me not often to visit my family because they were the opinion that I would learn there &quot; bad hab@@ it &quot; . &quot; that they suppose that Al@@ var@@ enga , which would speak for the indigenous group of Guar@@ an@@ í again , at home again her mother@@ language Guar@@ an@@ í would speak .

but her was absolutely clear that she got paid for everything they had paid by them with their hard work .
also in school , Al@@ var@@ enga has been discrimin@@ ated . &quot; one thing that is almost never talked about , bullying and the ra@@ kan@@ es that Cri@@ ad@@ itas are exposed when they go to school .
because the other children parents have parents , they recognize immediately that someone who has no parents who has no parents , a cri@@ ad@@ ita is .
I could not invite anyone to go home . I had no friends in school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in the time where friend@@ ships arise , I felt especially clear that I was not owned by any group .
the isolation was the worst of all , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ enga .
the Society appro@@ ves the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group in which it can be advertis@@ ed for cleaning personnel and n@@ anny in Paraguay .
the Administr@@ ator@@ in Group is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city dream@@ y in the district of As@@ unci@@ on .
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a little companion for my little daughter who plays in the morning and in the afternoon with it .
learning .
please fill in .
starting from Monday , if possible .
the ad was given five &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the place Ñ@@ u@@ by wrote that she had been a miser@@ able girl and gave their phone number .
another woman who also came from Ñ@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; wrote them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the third comment was written by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the state which I want to work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the coll@@ ision in the ad was once again :
dear friends , I have found one . I looked , if it works with her .
thank you , I write again , if something is .
the business was completed .
in the Pro@@ log to the report Cri@@ ad@@ itas , ¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ án@@ do ?
( Cri@@ ad@@ itas , how long still ? ) , a collection of stuff say former Cri@@ ad@@ itas , writes Or@@ ti@@ z :
in the course of our history we managed to establish systems such as sla@@ very , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the Early Con@@ quer@@ ors , the Con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores who had fallen apart from and to their &quot; wives , &quot; that many girls and boys go into a system of sla@@ very where they become light victims for abuse and exploitation .
the social inequality in Paraguay and that for the show of power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
legislative outlines on the Egyptian users of social media to register with the government

&quot; &quot; &quot; six@@ ty @-@ Egyptian parliament@@ arians have recently voted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regul@@ ators on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the regulations concerning usage and utility of social networking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he is adopted by the Parliament , users and users must register social media in Egypt by a government agency in order to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the basis of the law would then be set up a place which is tas@@ ked to use citizens and to use social media .
within six months with the adoption of the law , applic@@ ants would need to register user numbers and users on the website of the site with their right names and pay@@ outs to use social networks .
if it fails to do so , that might bring a penalty up to six months in j@@ ail or a money .
the draft law , which consists of six Par@@ agon and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt , defines social media as &quot; jed@@ uses &quot; which is running over the Internet and is used to communicate with others by means of voice , video content and text . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is un@@ clear how the law is set when it is assumed that the Egyptian authorities should not register the benefici@@ aries and users of the registration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ clear is the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not able to ensure the regulation on the level of social media companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , Parliament and Patr@@ ons of the wording , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users , and users received a username and password in order to come across the fire@@ wall , the Facebook blocks . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt is planning to take a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . due to which it would be necessary for the Egyptians and Egyptians to submit information to their identity to access the network .
but it has not been known so far that such plans are .
experts and experts on the ground are sc@@ ep@@ tical in regard to the technical fea@@ sibility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( EI@@ PR , on German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights , &quot; said Global Vo@@ ices :
I have two f@@ ils strong in the technical capacities and the understanding of whatever authority in Egypt with regard to things related to technology .
in my opinion they imagine that same as they for@@ c@@ eful the physical public and private rooms it could also be done online .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I take it seriously , then that it means a strong surveillance system to filter citizens , who apply for a permit or not . and this means a crazy system to monitor the activities of the people and also to bring them to a judicial process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is technically not realistic , but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be passed as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the legislative and constitutional conclusion before it goes into the plenary session . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether its acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not , the draft &quot; is consistent with a pro @-@ military mind@@ set in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ised and ensured that no devi@@ ant Nar@@ ration is present on the image surface , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year , the MP Tam@@ er El @-@ Sh@@ ah@@ aw@@ y proposed a proposal against Cy@@ ber crime crime , where a li@@ fel@@ ong prison sentence was planned for those who were found guilty to re@@ threat@@ ening the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; protest . &quot;

high above in the mountains of the Kur@@ dist@@ an area in the north @-@ east of the Ira@@ qi Kur@@ dist@@ an , the Ti@@ ag@@ uses H@@ ana Ah@@ med Raz@@ a and her team of scientists of the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq to protect the wit@@ ty Persian le@@ op@@ ards .
a sub@@ type of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards which acc@@ esses through Africa and Asia belong to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are due to Wil@@ der@@ ei , the loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat , and as they find less pre@@ y .
why is this specific type of le@@ op@@ ards so important ?
as Raz@@ a shows in the video , &quot; the Persian le@@ op@@ ard is the only survi@@ ving reven@@ ge in the Kur@@ dish ecos@@ ystem , &quot; and the health and the ability of the ecos@@ ystem also depends on that a large ra@@ de@@ af is present .
the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ards in fact is low and goes against zero . when the team in the video therefore presents that they have a recording of a big cat in Cam@@ ero@@ af@@ all , Raz@@ a immersed in pure joy .
being a pic@@ tured Bi@@ olog@@ in shows Raz@@ a passionate about a different side of their country which is not just war and conflict .

in the beginning of March 2017 documented , which were awarded for the Nor@@ theast of Japan , the progress made in the last six years to re@@ build the lives of those who were affected by the &quot; Trinity disaster &quot; of March 2011 . a vast earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a had triggered a catastrophe .
the Kah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in S@@ end@@ ai , which is located in the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was a great pre@@ f@@ ecture in Japan in the north @-@ east , both of them had to experience the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighboring leaders of Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a and I@@ w@@ ate have been mut@@ u@@ ated , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had all the coastal cities to disappear from the map .
yet the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a lived an atomic accident , already alone it had to leave 160 000 inhabitants their houses .
the special report of the Kah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o shows from local view which progress achieved six years later to re@@ build the life of local residents .
the detailed report of the newspaper contains both statistics of Japanese re@@ building and survey results of the people affected itself .
the housing in Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the Kah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper reported that until December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement houses ( or of them take ) , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate .
the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures could draw Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , here 80 per cent of the planned replacement houses were finished .
I@@ w@@ ate has finished 75 percent of such houses , where Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a is formed with 70 percent the final light .
however , they still strive for six years after the disaster , ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ated of Beh@@ avi@@ ors ( Sign@@ ed each of them , Kaz@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in final replacement parts .
after the three @-@ fold catastrophe , nearly 80 000 people saw forced to live in shel@@ ters .
in December 2016 there still lived 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a and I@@ w@@ ate in such containers .
nearly 40 percent of the Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a still live in emergency accommodation , whereas even more than 75 percent of the ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ates who grew up after the dis@@ aster in shel@@ tered shel@@ ters , were killed in final homes .
for I@@ w@@ ate the number is here at 34 percent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three affected cities
as the Kah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper could identify , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , who were affected by the un@@ happiness , their P@@ for@@ ks were back to December 2016 , which makes almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is much more difficult .
while nearly 100 percent of fisheries har@@ b@@ ors in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now back into operation , have res@@ um@@ ed their operation in Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a only 30 percent of the fishing ports .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the atomic accident , have drawn in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agricultural land @-@ large @-@ scale in co @-@ passi@@ ons .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 percent of the agricultural land in I@@ w@@ ate , and less than 50 percent of the A@@ cker@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a .
it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of nuclear un@@ fail@@ ures , because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares destroyed feu@@ ds of Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a , are located in the &quot; nuclear wave zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures the tourism has stepp@@ ed up again , but also here Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a remains far away .
the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are up to 90 percent at the same level as in front of the un@@ happiness . Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a on the other hand can only 75 per cent have .
however , the Kah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper also reported that since the disaster almost half of the coast @-@ inhabitants , it &apos;s harder to earn their li@@ vel@@ ih@@ oods .
is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake ?
in order to determine a total picture , the newspaper introduced numerous surveys among the native population and among the ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ates . she asked them about the state of re@@ building and also how to feel her sensation in front of the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in her introduction of the article explains the Kah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper :
the Kah@@ ok@@ u sh@@ imp@@ o led a survey by providing more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the native population .
the survey comp@@ lied that 8@@ 3.1 percent of the local residents , measures have taken to be prepared for the future earthquake and ts@@ un@@ amis .
however , 55.@@ 9 percent of the respon@@ dents that was still not done enough in cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es prevention .
how it comes to those who had to ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ated from the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a
in her output to the anniversary of the earthquake , the Kah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper has also enhanced its attention on the situation of the Ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ates of Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a .
Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a not only had to experience the huge earthquake and devast@@ ating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a was also witness of the worst , dis@@ astro@@ us , atomic , dis@@ astro@@ us , dis@@ astro@@ us in Japan .
from 160 000 ev@@ ac@@ uation from Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a nearly 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture .
at the beginning of 2016 , somewhat more than 23 000 people have been res@@ um@@ ed back to Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a , in long lasting spare parts .
after the booth of 2017 there is still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a outside their home @-@ pre@@ f@@ ecture .
in the Kat@@ astro@@ phen@@ areas , most of the ev@@ ac@@ uation issues are still older than 50 years old . you have to withdraw from right cou@@ plings , because the efforts for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ him@@ a must compete with massive construction projects . this is the construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games , the 2020 will be held in Tokyo .
the world is small : our Pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when people meet from other countries that speak a different language , the differences seem to be greater than the simil@@ arities .
after a while , you often recognize that one more connects than it seems at first sight .
these global connections are important as they challenge our pre@@ judi@@ ces to extend our perspectives and remind us that the world ultimately is very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices pod@@ cast , we look at exactly these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast , we treat topics covered in reporting often less attention as they deserve .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment where they have felt very strong with someone over language and national borders .
Veroni@@ ki Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the simil@@ arities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ ini explains how the love of music has consolidated its affection for Iranian culture ; Adriana M@@ aci@@ as talks about the time when she worked with people from all over the world ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences that he collected in a small village in Madagascar .

a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered this week into the Inten@@ sive station : last Friday had taken him a police officers during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with a bat@@ on against the head . nation@@ wide accepted millions of demonstr@@ ators on a Protest@@ ant against austerity .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , the social sciences at the University of Go@@ i@@ ás , has studied a skull @-@ past@@ as and several frac@@ tures .
physicians op@@ eri@@ ed him this Saturday and have put it into a artificial kom@@ a .
its condition is regarded as critical .
the local sculpture Lu@@ iz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus which quickly spread over a few days rapidly in Brazil .
on the pictures also the face of the police record was identified , the one with a stroke . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ aio .
after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian State of Go@@ i@@ ás was known that S@@ amp@@ aio , until the conclusion of the investigation of the incident of the active service is suspended .
the pictures show the police officers , as he suggests in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his dr@@ ummer on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( Photos : Lu@@ iz da Luz ) .
if a police kno@@ cked out of a prot@@ esters and land on the Inten@@ sive station , his face would see six months long on TV and the entire oppression would be justified .
the Facebook @-@ Page &quot; Des@@ neur@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media activi@@ sts from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared by Lu@@ iz da Luz there recorded video on the net , in which one sees how Mat@@ eus from the police officers is attacked and several sanitary shortly afterwards .
another video with the same scenes , but from another perspective also fil@@ med it has appeared in the social networks .
in the table shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another federal state , in the meantime , we have don@@ ated 10,000 Brazilian c@@ ais ( approximately 2,@@ 700 Euro ) to cover a portion of the cost of medical treatment and to keep his family in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , while he is in the hospital .
&quot; be bra@@ ve , Mat@@ eus .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence against activi@@ sts in Go@@ i@@ ás to the memory :
Go@@ i@@ ás experienced a wave of political force : here the activ@@ ator was killed by his father , and here was the Military Police of a W@@ hat@@ s@@ App group , and now we have been attacked the Occup@@ y movement of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , who has been attacked on the Inten@@ sive station , after being attacked by a polic@@ eman , who has be@@ aten him with a stroke .
police transfer
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil in which it came to brut@@ al police officers against demonstr@@ ators .
police officers continued in protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had built a stage for Red@@ ner , Gum@@ mig@@ esch@@ osse and Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
the MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( PS@@ OL ) , asked the police on loud@@ speaker through violence against demonstr@@ ators .
this also includes a report in fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers around the country .
once again the Brazilian media road@@ works have del@@ ayed by putting the focus on another , un@@ expected prot@@ ag@@ onists : a window @-@ plate .
the fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported targeted on a dist@@ ress glass pane to render their titles illustr@@ ative with a photo .
on the other hand the O Glo@@ bo f@@ ake a front story with a fire laid on by a fire .
there is no pl@@ au@@ sible journ@@ alistic base , more on a broken window @-@ screen than about the protests of thousands of people who serve the defense of a special thing .
this also has to recognise you if you are strictly against any form of damage .
here is also the term &quot; V@@ and@@ alism &quot; a absur@@ dity , di@@ spro@@ por@@ tion@@ ate meaning , and the typical violence of the military police are decei@@ ved by head@@ lines with the title &quot; demonstr@@ ators on con@@ front@@ ational path with the police .
the villages of the Ent@@ in@@ duc@@ tible villages in Cuba

the folk community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cu@@ ban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as a el Central - to Spanish Zu@@ cker@@ mühle - regardless of what there is no n@@ ut@@ able sugar @-@ sugar on site .
it is two years ago when the activities in the sugar factories are l@@ apped .
after the fall , the sugar cane industry was silent in the region and the factory lost gradually and after its facilities , until only the rum@@ ors of steel and concrete remained .
about 272 workers had to be found again .
some are rarely the work .
other re@@ signed and comm@@ uting every day to the factories that still die .
N@@ ene , a soldier &apos;s veter@@ an , which stands up every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugars industry do not smoke its sleep .
he heard that it is in the east of the region sugar factories that have been in operation after a long in@@ active time because they have been received .
that was something he was not expecting .
N@@ ene remin@@ ds us exactly that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich would receive the sugar cane factory , but the promise was not held .
the sugars industry already resi@@ sted the pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , the low market prices , the in@@ efficiency , the poor management decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , the production was 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than 1910 produced consumed .
the message would have been a mot@@ if for a scar@@ ed scar@@ ed for the country , but the bad harv@@ ests are already no more f@@ ancy .
why has the Cu@@ ban Zu@@ cker@@ ro@@ hr@@ industry was turned off ?
the old railway drive of the church looked even better times .
( photo : Julio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 Zu@@ cker@@ ro@@ hr@@ fabri@@ ken were technically out@@ dated , and hardly competitive , they were in@@ viable for the country .
the initial idea was to focus the production on the most efficient factories , the annual production objective was 4 million tons .
they left the factories which can produce sugar for maximum 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 euros ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives , which resulted in such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the crisis rise on the world market .
nonetheless , the sugar rate got back about a decade ago .
from 2017 to 20@@ 25 the price of un@@ refined sugar is to stay between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pounds , according to the report issued in the report of the Council of Economics &apos; from the OECD and FA@@ O , the agricultural and nutritional organization of the United Nations .
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tons ) , the raw sugar export of around 85 million dollars for the country .
not all went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will come down with certainty in the history , that were the first words of the Cu@@ ban President Fi@@ del Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from that there began the process of restructuring in the sugar industry .
in the following years , the st@@ agn@@ ation of a total of 98 sugar units , more than 65 million people got their full sal@@ aries for further training .
the same happened in the Zu@@ cker@@ ro@@ hr@@ fabrik Greg@@ orio Arl@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez has worked for 1967 in the factory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , talk about the closing of the factory , the word he is most repeated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fraud &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nearly all respon@@ dents are the same opinion , not one of them has been informed that the factory would be silent .
so that the place will get , they formed a full time - working group .
in front of the first year of the first year , the first letters began to come .
it was officially dism@@ iss@@ ed documents that would only be removed in relation to the parts that would be removed , the address and date of the date .
all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could host any withdrawal .
from that point the responsibility of the days and the letters have always been more frequent .
Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the bre@@ ast@@ ed factory for two years and he was one who received British letters . &quot; the country had no money for which sugar farms .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waiting for the retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Colom@@ a .
he was against his will at the st@@ agn@@ ation of the factory , in whose construction he helped .
with every part that he remote , dismant@@ led one of his 31 working years .
the best developed industrial sectors developed by Cuba and the most important workplace producer has been er@@ ased .
in many cases , there were no alternatives for jobs and services that generated the plants in the communities in which they found themselves .
we will never know if during the Mam@@ mut speech of 21 October 2002 , the dam@@ sel president saw in the eyes of the present people when he ensured that for the areas , whose factories were no longer in operation since five years would run all well .
the price of the population for closing the sugar systems
since 2004 sugar cane is only highly extrac@@ ted by mah@@ o@@ gan@@ y .

after two years , the economics of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the Zu@@ cker@@ ro@@ hr@@ fabrik completed , or better said than they began to ab@@ sorb it , they also heard on to asp@@ halt the road , this dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms .
without work in the region , and with an advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy are other factories .
they have been to spare parts .
without future perspective , many young people settled the region .
a food factory was created , whose production is not even used for the care of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still im@@ posing .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene went back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Colom@@ a , the ruins of the place where he began to work .
Ne@@ un@@ und@@ forty harv@@ ests will bring the old soldiers to spend an ann@@ u@@ ity of two @-@ end p@@ eso per month , in order to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man black skin color , small , with few teeth and clear@@ er voice , is not a trag@@ eous person , yet he gives the lies which one told him .
it has been around for ten years .
N@@ ene goes with 65 years in ann@@ u@@ ity , not because it is lacking power , but because he is bitter .

the original workshops were led by the educ@@ ator David Ho@@ d@@ ges , who lives in Montreal and in North Que@@ bec with ten C@@ ree @-@ communities and then worked with the C@@ ree Hip @-@ Hop group The North@@ Star .
the workshop thus climb@@ s that young participants in talks like &quot; cultural identity , language , engagement , love , self acceptance , &quot; or whatever it comes in mind .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos where young people are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the W@@ inn@@ eb@@ ago in the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ a@@ h First nation in British Columbia , for example the history of the highway 16 , also called &quot; highway of the tears , &quot; on which almost two do@@ zen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or mur@@ dered .
the cases were largely un@@ resolved .
the next video of the Nem@@ aska C@@ ree First Nation uses the motive of a video capture in order to convey the importance of maintaining traditional customs and customs , despite the influences of globalisation .
many of the songs appeared in Indi@@ genous languages , although the young people do not always master the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that the wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i C@@ ree First Nation has taken , the ch@@ orus is sung by the C@@ ree .
the young people received a little help from Gary Jol@@ ly from the North@@ stars Hip @-@ Hop group , who gives them a st@@ rop@@ he in the dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay C@@ ree @-@ h .
at the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ site of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an is the st@@ rop@@ he available in conversion , as well as a translation into English , which is translated here into German :
sometimes I feel as if no one would ever be interested in me .
but I try to go on the earth for my days .
that is the day when you are scre@@ ened our cry
because we have lost our way to life as youth
but I believe that we will rise to one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
this is how they grow up and also in our youth .
this is how they can do that which is dest@@ ined to be the Creator
in the commentary section of the reader and supporters of the C@@ ree @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also has a contribution and adds the st@@ rop@@ he in sil@@ ly ( which is also published on his blog and published here with permission again ) :

in Japan one can see almost every restaurant of sculp@@ tur@@ al dishes .
to show potential customers what exactly is located on the menu , are exhibited in the vicinity of the entrance hall , situated near the entrance hall , Pl@@ astic models of the dishes &quot; ) of each dish , which is served in this restaurant .
the customers see these plastic meals and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is an entire industry dedicated to making these plastic gr@@ ated .
in the Tokyo region of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , there are numerous of these small companies who produce those plasti@@ fic@@ ated dishes , which was documented by the German film@@ makers Wim Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese people these plastic gr@@ ated are so usually that they are not even more noticeable . however , a new trend is transformed today in a con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous mobile phone accessories and other gad@@ gets .
Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome released the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos , which show this unusual tw@@ ist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin .
now on special sale : new with plastic str@@ ated back@@ gro@@ omed mobile phone rings , as shown in K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ yu Hotels .
many of these man@@ made foods have been transformed to kit@@ schi@@ gen , as in this case , he@@ ater magnets :
here are a few Sho@@ ck@@ ball mag@@ net magnets for a new exhibit in the Tok@@ io station .
the new boom of the ess@@ ences is increasingly becoming more elaborate .
in this case a imperi@@ al @-@ don ( a popular travel bowl with seafood ) turned into a mobile stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lol ) we found a good use as a mobile phone stand .
we also made this part for the exhibition in Tokyo .
and here is an apple that cap@@ tures your mobile phone :
designed to watch how to watch an apple , with a cand@@ le for the mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and that is only the beginning of an increasing flight approach .
some Handy @-@ stands and Handy @-@ Designer allow you to manufacture your own artwork . in this case , i@@ kur@@ a or sal@@ mon uses , a popular d@@ opping which is served with white rice .
on Twitter , some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; is there someone who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wow , cool , now I can disgu@@ ise my mobile phone with sal@@ mon ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I will probably be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also take less appeti@@ zing form to surprise for example colleagues or family members unpleasant .
our latest mobile @-@ stands has the form of mel@@ ting ice .
in addition , there are also Reis@@ balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , ear@@ rings and hand@@ y@@ bands from dried sal@@ mon .
further sk@@ ur@@ als plastic gr@@ ated you can look at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # Eve
if you like to know more about the origin of this trend , then this video gives you an insight into the part of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , who devoted to the popular restaurant industry . such as with sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin @-@ pur@@ u .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic gr@@ ated are actually produced .
an Mexican project tells the stories of survi@@ vor@@ s of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the fight against the drug dealers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports and foreign media on the harsh &quot; struggle against the drug trading &quot; in Mexico looks at regular intervals . however , they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy , which brings this battle with itself .
the coverage of Drug Policy such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the boss of the Sin@@ alo@@ a @-@ Kart@@ ell , ur@@ red the stories of the victims of the conflict completely in the background .
on the day after a violent pre@@ fall hardly anyone looks upon the grap@@ e or upon the communities who have learned to live with pain .
behind each past@@ ries , behind every bone of the hundreds , the stories of numerous parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wo@@ unds might never be able to heal .
therefore the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , the digital project &quot; Apr@@ ender a Vivi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; with the drug trading live ) , these victims should give a voice and stories of men who testi@@ fied in the struggle between the prosec@@ ution authorities and cart@@ els .
Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project so :
organised crime can not only be fear@@ ed to fear our lives .
the effects are far more profound .
for example , if business close , because they are threatened by drug makers and whole churches have to drive so many kilometers to buy something such as milk .
the Pain of victims
&quot; &quot; &quot; a video with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vi@@ das que cam@@ bian por el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how fear lives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) explains exactly these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a main character is Guadalupe , a father , who is married each weekend , and searches for his son .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who lost only one day their father , her four brothers , her husband and two of their ne@@ ph@@ ew .
&quot; &quot; &quot; priests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like every Sunday we prepare ourselves today again for the task that we have posed , go and to gra@@ ves after the men we loved to seek . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Guadalupe : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Contr@@ eras Mat@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was 28 , when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electrical business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13th October he left the house .
on 15 October he should be back again but he never came back . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it is very difficult for me because I am now alone with three children who need a training .
there is also my mother , who is also here with me .
at the moment it has no income .
you are the insurance of my Father , but that does not get it out because that require a star rating .
where should we get the ones ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; ap@@ r@@ a vi@@ vir con el nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
we do not only have to show the faces of those who face the fear . we must show the international community the conflicts , the frag@@ ility and state leadership .
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high risk @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ HB , a reader of Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this contribution from Tax@@ co , the Federal State of Gu@@ err@@ ero in Centr@@ al@@ exi@@ ko .
your contribution remin@@ ds us that you should never look at violence as normal , no matter what form it appears :
I have been familiar with disease and sensors journ@@ alism for several years now .
I &apos;m passing each day at times of time ti@@ ques and see the front pages with pictures , which can actually only come from a text@@ book for criminal attor@@ neys or from specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I have the feeling , as if I am the only one that is ad@@ verse or sad . it works as a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be syn@@ onymous with it or consider it as normal .
it writes on :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ous@@ in thinks that he is Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) will be if he is great . and it &apos;s not normal that people hear songs on the &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; of the off@@ ences when going through the streets .
for me it is that they would di@@ el those who have lost someone and those who have fear that they too have something like that .
I see our weakness if stories are mere figures in a statisti@@ c .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ dig@@ om@@ nia of the people is unbeliev@@ able for me when the death of six people and the dis@@ appearance of 43 students in a neighboring village are justified that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; off@@ ended . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they are trying to speak of such a trag@@ e@@ dies , if they are not stir@@ red and silent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four months exploring the capital city &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; it describes how a family ended with threats now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it describes how armed crimin@@ als reaches money from their business until they have not only destroyed the business but also their family apart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you think of everything you have lost and how many people can change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain about it never goes , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes again high , if you &apos;re alone .
habits have changed , telephone numbers also .
we just contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the further we are removed , the better .
it looked in its report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested , because you do not know when they will kid@@ n@@ ap or kill you .
I asked myself in this terrible days , if wines would solve my deep@@ ened feelings , but the answer is no , because I have forgotten how you we@@ pt . I must learn to live with pain .
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega released the article &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a mature generation of violence . &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions on how : who cares about the child of a missing wife and a man who has been killed by organised crime ?
how is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age whose parents take care of her .
Br@@ yan is a commodity and he tells that he had to teach himself how to make a egg coo@@ p , tor@@ ti@@ llas , and &quot; Ch@@ ich@@ i &quot; for the Bab@@ ies who live with him . this is his name for preparing the vial of water , sugar and milk pul@@ vers .
he tells of the nine s@@ cars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
but they are un@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a baby for all life of violence and he had to learn to live so .
when he was five years old , you told him that his mother was gone .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood has been past two years ago , than a few blocks away from his home , the blo@@ ody ly@@ che of his father saw that was shot by armed men from a fore@@ going car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez was born :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 as violence by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most vulnerable city in the world due to the number of stat@@ utes according to the indications of the Federal Council for Public Safety and the Government of the Government of the United States .
in 2010 alone the prosec@@ ut@@ or 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de presented . this corresponds to the cut 8.5 murder per day .
these are only a few of hundreds of thousands who organised crime in Mexico and penet@@ rate the country &apos;s soul .
few stories always live in view of new head@@ lines . however , this project remin@@ ds us of those that we must not forget .
in addition to the project &quot; Apr@@ ender a Vivi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico 2015 , its objective is to present the complex information behind the failed fight against the drug @-@ trade , which has hi@@ red the country in the last four decades , in a compreh@@ en@@ sible way .
when a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; from Flick@@ r @-@ users Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ strö@@ m ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) WAR@@ N@@ ING : this contribution and the pages to which it is linked to contain pictures on which violence is represented .
the fact@@ orial is important in a moment where it is about to lift a s@@ caff@@ old or a for@@ gery .
but how is the year after something appeared in the first time ? content into social media , no matter if true or un@@ true , it ten@@ ds to continue to exist .
take this picture of a terrible disaster 7 years ago in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( DR@@ C ) .
since its first release there was mis@@ leading , trag@@ e@@ dies used to testi@@ fy which actually occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this wrong copy of image and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - deny not the fact that there is abundant reporting about events in the Democratic Republic of Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our desire for pictures on messages .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
2010 le@@ qu@@ ered a pet@@ rol the place S@@ ange on the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo , ki@@ pp@@ le around and explo@@ ded . there were 230 people around life .
after the civil war in Africa the two @-@ biggest country had been negl@@ ected and thereby armed . the streets in the region became a dangerous paths of stroke that were difficult to be@@ have .
in the case of the pet@@ rol , the pet@@ rol , fell victim to the victim .
official representatives describe a fire@@ ball , the tri@@ mming houses , including a cin@@ emas in the vicinity , which was full of people who des@@ cen@@ ded the Foot@@ ball Championship .
houses with br@@ ushed and em@@ ated cor@@ p@@ ses lay in the streets scattered .
many people were burned to the ignor@@ ance .
a picture with the title &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; by Im@@ g@@ ur @-@ User My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12 . January 2015 @-@ 2015 photos of the incident form the gru@@ esome scenes of this day .
above is an example of this .
it displays rows of hol@@ low body , which are lined up on the ground while people watch them .
but here history does not find its end .
over the years the same photo has been raised several times on social media , blogs and other platforms and mis@@ diagnosed each real but not related to the trag@@ e@@ dies , in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , fighters of the B@@ oko Har@@ am the dep@@ ra@@ zed Nig@@ eri@@ an villages B@@ aga and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
eye @-@ witnesses reported dr@@ as@@ tically from atro@@ cities before which it had to fle@@ e .
houses and shops were burned down and cor@@ rupt plants in streets and past@@ ries .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were mass@@ ac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody remained back to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a local people to Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many were dis@@ ar@@ ded , shot or burned .
only based on satellite models , the consequ@@ ent time could be visu@@ alised .
the occasion for the attack was also uns@@ ol@@ ved , but the ar@@ mies used in B@@ aga was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ an and the trial of the B@@ oko Har@@ z , to attract country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture emerg@@ es from the Democratic Republic of Congo , when it was mist@@ aken as proof of the fact and the potential extent of attack :
this is Nigeria .
a mass@@ ac@@ re of 2,000 people took place two days in Paris .
they are not Charlie .
you are dead .
in fact , this abuse of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of fail@@ ures ; Africa Check has documented assign@@ ments to Nigeria since 2014 .
in all of these cases the picture was referred to as a cover for mass@@ ages .
yet another step further bring personal comments such as fal@@ si@@ zing the picture from the Democratic Republic of Congo with sources of mass media in connection to arguments .
the picture from S@@ ange also entered in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a fl@@ ashes , published by the United Nations the ones described by the United Nations the t@@ anning , rap@@ e , rap@@ e and no@@ ble T@@ ote , some by burning .
while others reported by violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Post@@ s as the following on , which brought these descriptions together with photos from the Democratic Republic of the Congo :
this picture comes from a sau@@ di @-@ Arab message , which in 2012 is mist@@ aken , the President of Myanmar was said , Mo@@ che and politicians would have participated in the murder of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she used the picture from the Democratic Republic of Congo to order this information .
the original article , which was recently accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news organisations , AF@@ P as their source , had also mist@@ aken Th@@ a B@@ eing this statement , but had not been linked with the image from the Democratic Republic of Congo .
the worldwide reach of false information
traces of these false coupling range until 2011 and 2012 will actually be back from all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; using a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inver@@ ted picture search &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you can replace how far more information can cross borders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a revers@@ ed picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found under 18,@@ 8 billion images ( status of 3 May 2017 ) 344 images , which are very similar to the said picture from the Democratic Republic of the Congo .
they come from a mix@@ er private sites , platforms social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have passed false reports to inter@@ f@@ ere , others tried to escape counter@@ f@@ eit@@ ing .
we have examples for the ab@@ usi@@ ve use and associated with the respective countries , based on which site they have been published , we want to pose the reach more clearly than by the language alone .
from the countries listed below ( which in some cases were also connected with each other ) several examples may be used for mis@@ use .
here some cases which can now be completely split now ( on the map in orange ) :
map : News Fr@@ ames .
examples of incorrect cou@@ pl@@ ations of the image from the Democratic Republic of Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the or@@ ange@@ ed countries point out on pages or servers , via the examples of counter@@ f@@ eit@@ ing or fal@@ sen@@ ders are still available .
the countries in Gray are examples that are according to the met@@ adata and information that are available via Tin@@ Eye , probably also counter@@ f@@ eit examples .
as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Algeria , 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is happening in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a link to the picture from the Democratic Republic of Congo has been written in an online discussion forum ( directed an Algeri@@ an and interested party ) as part of a thread to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme example of an ab@@ usi@@ ve use of the image from the Democratic Republic of Congo , with one twe@@ et , the sympathy opposite the Nig@@ eri@@ an Mass@@ ac@@ re , and on the other hand an attempt of blo@@ gg@@ ers , the claims , the Roh@@ ing@@ ya will be prosec@@ uted , as yet the photos of it were ab@@ usi@@ ve .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the Myanmar Government released a statement about what they appeared as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conc@@ ise news and photos , the international media , international human rights organizations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ concep@@ tions regarding Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this indic@@ ative , which has been published exclusively in English , also includes references to counter@@ f@@ ake images of s@@ caff@@ olds , which H@@ ate Spe@@ ech operate and be used by extrem@@ ist groups to explain that Muslims spread Budd@@ hi@@ sts and other sr@@ um ( which is often distributed by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .

Saudi @-@ Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these news , claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein were in 2012 , that mon@@ ks and politicians have been involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought together the story with the image from S@@ ange . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the article was updated in 2014 and is still included in the publication of this publication .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 about students , which were reported by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the Catholic @-@ standing news from An@@ á@@ lis@@ is Digital , has expressly declares that the picture does not come from the daughters , but it claims that there is a &quot; similar ji@@ ha@@ dist@@ s attack . &quot;
as the picture later , in connection with the mass@@ ac@@ re of the B@@ oko Har@@ z , Har@@ z , tried to contradi@@ ct the newspaper El Pa@@ is , that there would be connections to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ Dün@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ uy &quot; ( Nigeria ) .

they wanted to achieve that their communities were made aware of these events , of pro@@ ud@@ ly in the name of Islam , a greater attention .
USA , 2015 .
the picture was we@@ ather@@ ed as a cover for the mass@@ ac@@ re of the B@@ oko Har@@ z 2015 ( and more than 9.@@ 300 Male ret@@ we@@ et@@ et ) . but the emb@@ assies that were connected with that were in no religious context have been addressed .
instead , the aim of attrac@@ ting attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of the media pres@@ criptions in the comparison of Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Indonesian ) , 2014 .
after a message , which was alleg@@ edly written by a &quot; P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mart@@ os &quot; on the Nig@@ eri@@ an mass@@ ac@@ re , in circulation , translated it deals with discussions as this here on Vietnamese and explained it to mis@@ alignment .
from the message , in which the picture was included in the Democratic Republic of Congo , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ ine Mission@@ aries and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mart@@ os .
there are more confirmed examples of an un@@ correct use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
to other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and sites in the following countries ( on the map in grey ) Tin@@ Eye also points , however , are no longer fully trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entry with URLs and time / dates exist on the web cra@@ w@@ ler and coll@@ ects them via image files in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslim . )
in all of these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original un@@ happiness from 2010 , the image may ultimately be a correct description but the original membership fee is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two strong themes or frames . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photo was used in regards to greater discussions about silence in connection with the murder of Christians through Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the murder of Roh@@ ing@@ ya through Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fr@@ aming uses the image to discuss how African life is assessed compared to a European or French life .
religion is to be understood and the value of human life is both important . therefore it is worth deta@@ iling as images in connection with these efforts are being used .
however , a deeply ques@@ tioning is what happens when readers can no longer give faith in these images .
with social media there are fifty people who lack accidental to exercise the water around a tragedy .
suggest this mood of the inf@@ alli@@ on and fal@@ seh@@ ood , that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and fl@@ ushed to the actual Gre@@ ys of what actually occurred in the Democratic Republic of Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the spread of violent images has already been demonstrated in detail ( for example ) .
an argument is that this with@@ draws of images of an ex@@ propri@@ ation , the tragedy w@@ aller . bis@@ cus these images even calls from the sacrific@@ es themselves .
at the same time , the concern is that violent pictures readers and vie@@ wers can des@@ ensi@@ tise and providing them the ability to emp@@ athy emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which studied , how enormous media work to help others ) .
while there is a lot to discuss for@@ ci@@ ble depic@@ tions in the news media , the fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Techn@@ ologist experiment because with algorithms in order to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; . you will think thoroughly about the situation where a picture emerg@@ es something , but actually it can also be dis@@ solved by the context or entirely ab@@ usi@@ ve way .
however , an investigation was wrong subsi@@ dies , but should also take into account how internationally they can be .

the &quot; Im@@ transl@@ atable &quot; Blog un@@ veil@@ ed the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages

a blog with the name of Un@@ transl@@ atable ( such as D@@ t. un@@ transl@@ atable ) endeav@@ ors to offer a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not at all to translate .
such words are in any language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these in@@ transl@@ atable words are already well known ( such as the famous Portuguese su@@ ck ) and others who are deeply ro@@ oted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ m@@ esa ) .
but all with@@ stand stu@@ b@@ bor@@ n@@ ly each attempt of a simple translation .
a word or expression is not enough why a full explanation and sometimes a bit context are required to understand exactly what is meant for that one word .
these unique words were already collected quite a time in an online list .
most of these lists cover Japanese , German , French , Portuguese , or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; translation &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
in the blog you can find for example words from the exc@@ l . language of V@@ anu@@ at@@ u , as :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Look up your parents in recognition of how to strive for you in younger years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and words in the H@@ uns@@ wick language that are spoken in parts of Brazil as :
&quot; kw@@ adi &quot; - The convenience or la@@ zin@@ ess that you feel after getting caught in cold days in the sun .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog about :
they de@@ ar@@ ded different cultures , reve@@ aling other faul@@ ts and ar@@ ouse our novel@@ ty .
sometimes you can influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this site still want to publish more of these &quot; un@@ translation &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Red@@ ner of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which are highly regarded by transl@@ atable , are invited to un@@ load their favorite here . &quot; &quot; &quot;

how Sri Lanka with the worst fl@@ ush catastrophe of the decade
the island of Sri Lanka is currently visible the worst flood disaster in this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon , which normally ended at the end of May , have joined the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , Gin , N@@ il@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya in 15 districts in the south and west of the country over the banks .
after an opinion of the cat@@ astrop@@ hic center of Sri Lanka from 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and almost hundreds of people are missing due to the flood and sl@@ amm@@ ing win@@ ches .
over 400 000 people have been affected for the last Friday ( 26 May ) and about 100 000 people have been brought to 304 secure villages .
the ra@@ inf@@ ants left on Saturday ( 27 May ) , and the waterfalls in some areas went slowly back .
health and hygiene conditions are a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos give an impression of the scale of the disaster disaster :
flood in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water conditions up to 7.5 metres . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am Ame@@ en and Sri Lanka twe@@ et provide regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # Flo@@ od@@ SL to monitor the extent of disaster .

the Air Force has five aircraft for lif@@ ebo@@ at transactions and further five are finished for transportation of not@@ ches for those included in their over@@ floo@@ ded villages .
also various organizations and start@@ ups have prepared themselves to help .
Facebook @-@ Sites such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tory in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Rel@@ ief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka supply important information on high @-@ efficiency situation and humanitarian aid .
if any search and bail@@ out team for their operations require , please call the number 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 .

last year after the catastrophe of the Tro@@ p@@ enst@@ ur@@ ms Ro@@ an@@ u , the Pick@@ Me brought a &quot; high water &quot; button which allowed it to users , a vehicle to pick up assistance from assistance and donations . these were then distributed free to the sr@@ apped Red R@@ ote cross .
&quot; &quot; &quot; likewise , they led a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ OS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button which had more than thousands of requests and 150 successful Boat returns for through floo@@ ds and in@@ dr@@ astic people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the united efforts of the government and civil population of Sri Lan@@ kas where several social media platforms are fully exploited , residents in need for security and can contribute to aid .
this has prevented the loss of further lives , whereby the population of Sri Lan@@ kas have now been the long way to restoring the norm@@ ality .
Muslims that you cannot see
the Women &apos;s March on 21 January 2017 in San Francisco .
photo of Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ ha@@ zi .
use Auth@@ ori@@ t.@@ Dam@@ as in January I participated in the Women &apos;s March at San Francisco with a neigh@@ bor and love friend .
I trusted her my four year old daughter , she trust me her children ; she is my rock in the bran@@ ding .
in one minute we call for par@@ sing for the rights of women .
in the next process we tend to record rights for trans@@ gender .
we are located in a sea of rain@@ zu@@ res and people , some hold the i@@ kon@@ ic picture of a woman with head@@ scar@@ f high , bound from a American flag , other sc@@ ending par@@ olen against Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my girlfriend look forward and says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things concern not you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already managed these entertainment .
people with whom I work , or people who know me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar who know it - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; who built up in their imagination .
it divi@@ des me .
there are worldwide 1,7 billion Muslims .
we do not see all the same .
we practi@@ se our religion .
we identify with them to be a Muslim but on different kinds . but somehow we all put in the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is well designed in our collective imagination as soon as Muslims , who like I do not fit there , be di@@ abo@@ lic .
de@@ com@@ ers become lim@@ it@@ alized
I will not stand alone .
this is even to be the po@@ et , whose poetry is sold in America : Rum@@ i .
which images come to one in the sense when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
when J@@ al@@ alu@@ dd@@ in Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was a Orthodox mus@@ cular pre@@ acher and schol@@ ars .
Islam , the Quran and the Prophet Muhammad were to the day when he died , the center of his poetry .
but in the western idea the religion was deleted Rum@@ is , just as from the most popular translations of its poetry .
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a large part of the history of 1,7 billion Muslims in this world .
another consists in the re@@ fac@@ tional pictures of Muslims that have col@@ oni@@ zing Western books for centuries .
this temp@@ ting picture is determined by the dark man that should be fear@@ ed and the exotic woman you should save .
the weg@@ ed Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid sh@@ ook the story behind these pictures in the 19@@ 70s .
but these images also rise further .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continued to continue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have worked for thir@@ teen years in the news industry and I have seen how this powerful , incorrect Nar@@ r@@ ative Nar@@ r@@ ative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; domin@@ ates our new@@ fe@@ eds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this Nar@@ rati@@ v over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed the reality that have led to nine Muslim women over the last three decades , while the USA was not even able to vote even their first female presidential nom@@ inee .
this Nar@@ rati@@ v fails to acknowledge that if French , Muslim women are forced to wear their head@@ scar@@ f in public buildings and cover the Arab , Muslim women by their government to cover their entire body , which are both sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group exercises their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this strong Nar@@ rati@@ v s@@ wor@@ e mus@@ c women , the movements of change lead .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it looks like the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil from Afri@@ kan@@ ers who were hi@@ ther@@ ed with sla@@ very . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it del@@ etes the existence of Que@@ er @-@ Muslims .
this Nar@@ rati@@ v has led our collective imagination , deep and mis@@ led that often Si@@ k@@ h @-@ men and children become the goal of tim@@ us@@ sel@@ ic attacks and ra@@ ids .
&quot; &quot; &quot; due to these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them is Islam@@ opho@@ bia today not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
becoming one of the 1,7 billion
in the news industry we do more than just stories to tell that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create Nar@@ r@@ ative that help us understand the world .
and my industry is predic@@ ted to grasp the Nar@@ rati@@ v of 1,7 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed here to make seven million Muslims in the highest degree &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; various &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious group in America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than one third of the entire Muslim population are African Americans .
six of ten American Muslims belong to the immigrants in the first generation , which come from 77 countries .
the parents of the author in 1976 in New York .
use approved .
four decades ago my lon@@ ged parents came to live in New York in order to live their American dream .
my mother laid their first jewelry design in 5th Avenue before and my father worked hard in the skyscr@@ apers of New York ; skyscr@@ aper were made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ cian from Bangladesh with the name gate Rah@@ man Kh@@ an .
back as Kh@@ an the sky@@ lines of the world re@@ thought , my parents were un@@ miss@@ able Muslims and Americans .
but am I now un@@ w@@ wo@@ unds Muslims and American ?
sometimes , when I ask people why I am not a por@@ k esse , I say - instead of my Muslim recipes , or to bring my handy hand@@ ker@@ chief that all Muslims wear with themselves - &quot; from respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
I scher@@ ze , we do not wear all the hand@@ ker@@ chiefs with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also have to be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to become almost always selected for additional safety checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim schol@@ ars , Muslim activi@@ sts and inter@@ religious activi@@ sts who are trying to fight far more widespread lies over Islam .
these lies are produced on the ongoing band from a well @-@ ated Islam@@ opho@@ bia with money @-@ makers , th@@ ink tanks and experts for counter@@ f@@ eit information , which is our already faul@@ ty picture of what a Muslim is ; or about what Islam is , manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories we tell and because of the manner in which we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia there lies in more than just a stran@@ ger that makes a woman the head@@ scar@@ f .
or as the sc@@ ary card of attacks on mos@@ ques in the whole USA , see below .

use approved .
I would like to explain .
I was born as a Muslim , but a Muslim was born only then in my imagination , when I was four years old , in a provisi@@ onal mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when soci@@ ists should describe religious life , they refer to the following terms : faith , behavior and affili@@ ation .
my mus@@ c faith and behaviour are perhaps not always visible , but they are there .
maybe my girlfriend , my neigh@@ bor , my rock at the bran@@ dy see that I am Muslims , when they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the nigh@@ tly ritual with my daughter if I wi@@ den them into my arms and her the Arab verses to protect against the coral and called Q@@ ul@@ s .
each of them I repeat three times .
I ask that they are protected against evil , evil , that one can see and evil that you cannot see .
my Muslim belief is possibly not always visible , but my Muslim Bro@@ adh@@ er@@ ence is always part of my shadow .
the grand@@ mother of the author , when she wins a icon competition in Kar@@ achi , with her sisters sometimes in the 19@@ 60s .
use approved .
belonging to my grand@@ mother is the picture of my grand@@ mother &apos;s mat@@ ern@@ ess with her sisters , as she would gain a contest for the art of the flower arran@@ ging in Kar@@ achi .
it is the image of you that I see at this moment when I close my eyes : Nano , surrounded by its full and un@@ finished paintings , with many book@@ marks , a book with one @-@ and @-@ four cap@@ itals that can affect almost completely .
Muslims means to speak the prayers they had said to me when I have a bad day .
Muslims began to be Muslims as she has brought me to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord .
for a people that was founded over centuries - by a &quot; Imperi@@ um &quot; Col@@ oni@@ zed , founded a company with the name of Hon@@ worthy British Ost@@ ini@@ dien @-@ Komp@@ anie , it has a deep meaning , God , to name my only Lord .

belonging means to grow and listen to that men do not w@@ at , but at the same time see that my zu@@ ed grandfather cri@@ es cri@@ es .

belonging to this is knowing that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians , whose families , as in my grandfather , have been diver@@ ted by col@@ oni@@ alists , who have split the Muslim world like at stake .
Muslims mean to know that in the last two centuries Europeans will have col@@ oni@@ zed all up to four Muslim countries . &quot;
it means knowing that the first a@@ erial bombar@@ d@@ ment of history was broken down a century ago on a Muslim country .
it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grand@@ mother , a intimate , k@@ ash@@ mir@@ age of British imperialism , was referred to by the newspapers of his time as &quot; dangerous , &quot; as he introduced the first mosque in England .
even before there was aircraft , he travelled into more parts of the world when I was ever and pre@@ aching the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

it means remem@@ bering that four@@ teen years ago the powerful military of the world , with troops being distributed over every continent apart from the Antarc@@ tic , in Iraq , in order to med@@ itate weapons of mass destruction that did not exist .
it means knowing that over half a million Ira@@ ist under the tru@@ ffle of the war lie .
an American Muslims means to know that the self @-@ mor@@ dr@@ ate among veter@@ ans since 2001 has risen by more than 32 percent .
it means knowing that when a tragedy w@@ et@@ ched the USA and bears the susp@@ ects a Muslim name that will tell the story four times more than a story with a white attacks .
it means knowing that a few hundred years ago the first prayer che@@ er , the Az@@ aan , was called by a liber@@ ated black sla@@ ve with the name Bil@@ al .
it means knowing that two hundred years ago a African Islam@@ ist named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was vers@@ ed and brought into this land .
it means that Mal@@ col@@ m X call an American hero .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is heat that I think , when people filled the airports to fight against the Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the hope that I feel when we stand for our dreams and when we say black life .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the Nar@@ rati@@ v of 1.7 billions contains more possibilities than a mag@@ ician , but is represented in the reduced branches &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his mother is to be a mother to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people er@@ ect on this two @-@ ness structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia consists in the Muslim registr@@ ar which began with President Bush and extended to President Obama .
it consists of active monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists in the immig@@ rant who took a five @-@ year old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it consists in a country that jo@@ ins its borders towards people from just the countries that bombar@@ ded it .
it is a wrong and neb@@ ul@@ ous &quot; No @-@ Fly list , &quot; which largely depends on the Arabs and Muslims in the visor .
there are wars that we lead and the bom@@ bs which we throw on Muslim countries .
because of the stories we tell and because of those who we are not telling , we are here today .
in a study with the title Asc@@ ent of Man , scientists shown the North@@ western University of participants a scienti@@ fic@@ ally un@@ correct image and poss@@ essed them to judge groups on a scale of 1 to 100 as regards evolution .

the Con@@ vers@@ ations we have to guide
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deep dar@@ ing to mis@@ ise the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we stand ahead decades to detect the roots of our fears and faul@@ ty and dangerous expression , which we ver@@ ted into our new@@ sletters .
at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry , which tries to capture our frequently with conn@@ ective identi@@ ties and forgotten history .

but I am concerned because of this difficult global point of time , in which we find ourselves .
and this moment has consequences that go beyond the 1,7 billion .
there is a reason that conspir@@ acy , who existed in the dark corners of the internet , now the White House lead .
they are exposed to exp@@ on@@ entially because they made Muslims as others . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is another group that has grown exp@@ on@@ entially by creating &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few years before , she had not yet been given them , now they master major areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am worried about the re@@ alities and the history , which I was not aware of as I was so old now , as it is now my daughter , but who made me a f@@ um@@ ed Muslim Bro@@ thers .
things I left here like a bread@@ cr@@ ack in my speech .
things that perhaps aw@@ aken memories because in all the inter@@ pret@@ ations that make our human race like a story , where someone is made to a &quot; other . &quot;

but these are not terms with which we usually cast at our schools or which we read in our newspapers .

we have to ask ourselves un@@ convenient questions about the role of that , consciously and un@@ aware of the &quot; other &quot; to keep in rain during the women &apos;s March , because the employment that we have no president , the chocolate has been bombar@@ ded , while he is already capit@@ alized , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1,7 billion .

initiative for nar@@ ro@@ art wants to preserve urban diversity
lay@@ outs , by Flick@@ r @-@ users Daniele Ros@@ si , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a possibility here and now despite a language barrier to contact someone ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the initiative Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) is the in@@ comes of stories in their original language a possible response to it .
global Vo@@ ices told about a different initiative by Steven Bird , the Un@@ ison@@ able blog .
here however , the focus of T@@ LS is not written on the written words , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language variety of big cities .
in fact , urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has already performed events since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite so small languages are not passed on to the children there .
the following applies to the creators of the project :
the mass mort@@ ality of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that have diversity , safe spaces where residents do not have to forget who they are to belong to them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; during &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listen often associated with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; purposes these events instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening to estimate , to feel tie , &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format the stor@@ yt@@ eller presents their history first in their own language and then translate them into English .
even if the participants are not a professional history of history , their dev@@ otion and their representation is that the audi@@ ences will be granted .
they call lau@@ ghter and emotions that the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video presents for example a traditional story of Burk@@ ina Fas@@ o , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round the histor@@ ies nar@@ r@@ ator R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou will also take the opportunity to explain for their country typical customs of brass .
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the Fa@@ bel from the bun@@ nies and the P@@ avian in the language Sh@@ ona from Zim@@ babwe :
&quot; &quot; &quot; after having declared the meaning of his Fa@@ bel , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is in demand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how is that to speak to an audience that does not understand your language ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a big smile , he shares his feeling of inclusi@@ veness : &quot; &quot; &quot;
you have list@@ ened !
you were attentive ...
they were all with me !
so far the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling have taken place in three cities and the organiz@@ ers hope to expand it . all who are inspired by the project can be in contact with T@@ LS to organise their own histor@@ ies .
Puerto Rico calls for the USA real@@ ign@@ ment of the debt debt
with the aim of a re@@ visi@@ oning of public debt of Puerto Rico , which participated in 72 million US dollars , took place on the 3rd of April 2017 diverse religious and civil organizations in a mass demonstration ; the march was started by the puert@@ ic Capit@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and ran to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ an .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she was called by the group@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fr@@ ente Ci@@ ud@@ ad@@ ano por la Audit@@ or@@ ía de la D@@ eu@@ da &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Civil Front for the re @-@ examination of debts ) and the District Church of Puerto Rico . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the inter@@ c@@ essors of the debts of the debt have also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their call :
the people of Puerto Ric@@ os demands that politicians , banks and government agencies responsible for debts are accountable for their cor@@ rupt .
we call for a financial inspection and a draft committee without personal interests in public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions corresponding to us , which in favor of the economy acts .
we become pres@@ ent@@ less and supp@@ ressed .
the people Puerto Ric@@ os ref@@ uses to pay a debt that is not their own .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not find themselves with decl@@ ining retirement .

the Sy@@ ro @-@ Palestinian Web@@ developer Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , is missing for over a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after having been arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives were continuing to continue the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he has made for an open network .
at this year &apos;s re : Publi@@ ca , the annual conference on digital culture , which is oriented annual in Berlin , dedicated to the event of the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign .
Mé@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist in France resident CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , business@@ leader at Book spr@@ ints , a publisher of the book C@@ ost of Freedom : a Coll@@ ective le@@ verage ( The cost of freedom : a collective re@@ research ) .
the book , which was published last year and is available here license @-@ free , contains a number of papers that deal with free culture in face of oppression .
it is a hom@@ age to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction is it :
this book would like to discuss how movements are constructed for free knowledge and what the real costs are , with whom this is connected .
activi@@ sts , artists , designer , developers , researchers and authors , who are involved in the movements of freedom of knowledge , have been able to assist you on the fo@@ g that surrounds our News@@ fe@@ eds and to create some sense of our various experiences .
this book is an attempt to rid Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celeb@@ rating internet volunteers , who has been imprison@@ ed in Syria since 15 March 2012 .
his name was painted from the folder of Ad@@ ra prison , in which he sat on October 3 , 2015 .
since then , we have no information about his current state or residence .
the intro@@ duc@@ tory part of his book with the title Coll@@ ective Memory gives his friends and family a voice that push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom .
to see how Bass@@ el pays a high price for their participation in a free culture , many of us begin to think about their own dest@@ in@@ ates , deeds and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what have we decided ?
what have we given up in this process of tim@@ eless extreme beliefs ?
the web developer for open source and digital activ@@ ist has been in the harbour of Syrian government authorities since March 2012 .
in October 2015 Bass@@ el was born from the Ad@@ ra prison , a non @-@ military organization to an unknown place .
his wife , the writer and Ombud@@ sp@@ erson N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi , told that the &quot; Military Police Bass@@ el had taken on the basis of a &quot; strict secret &quot; command from his cell in Ad@@ ra . &quot;
G@@ ha@@ zi reported it was contacted on 12 November 2015 by persons who asked yourself as the in@@ sider &apos;s @-@ Assad and took note of an inn@@ ed death sentence against her husband .
to be a common place and condition remain unknown .
a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in finding access to the Internet and knowledge to the public in Syria .
Bar@@ ry Th@@ re@@ w , a Designer , Techn@@ ologist and at the moment &apos;s access to the manager of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bas@@ ler &apos;s cultural prot@@ otypes present was the work that he began with a group of Arch@@ ae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to construct the ancient ruins Palm@@ yr@@ as virtual .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important ar@@ che@@ ological sites of the world , was the roadmap of numerous civili@@ z@@ ations and here mer@@ ges Greek @-@ Roman architectural types with hi@@ esi@@ ons traditions and Persian influences .
Bass@@ a couldn &apos;t know that ten years after having started working with this work the IS would have to put all this architecture that em@@ bo@@ died not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but in the world .
this strip in the digital arch@@ ae@@ ology and conservation has created a time @-@ capsule , which will be in@@ valuable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
trag@@ ically , Bass@@ el this project could not yet close .
N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I spent my whole life with it , of freedom to dream and b@@ ass@@ el instruc@@ ted me to embrace it .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call on his name .
Bass@@ el brought me English for me , even when he was already in cu@@ sto@@ dy .
I learned to read English well , write and speak English .
he has always shared his knowledge with each one who has asked . he has taught other incar@@ cer@@ tained , English , to write and speak .
Bass@@ a opened the gate to the technology . he taught me both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
he has also brought other incar@@ nations as they use computers , at least theore@@ tically without that they actually held a place in their hands .
G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( waiting ) , a block , which she wrote in the years 2012 until 2015 , when he was in cu@@ sto@@ dy .
Bass@@ el and N@@ oura have worked for a year together on the book .
they scru@@ pul@@ led the lyrics to him , when they visited him and he translated them out of the Arabic in English .
the book is free @-@ free .

the book is devoted to public domain .
here is an excerpt from the book of Nora with the title &quot; It happens . &quot;
it is done every time you visit ,
that I fail in the world of your enchanting eyes ,
that I lose the cre@@ ature at the moment in which we embrace ,
that each of the dangers no matter
each of the f@@ ences , bond@@ age and watch@@ man
I forget the thr@@ ong of prison
and I dr@@ inge upon every detail of your voice and words
which I tr@@ age with passion for me
when your eyes say ,
and I will let another piece of my soul with you ...
I honest@@ ly back to my lon@@ eliness ,
to reg@@ ain all the moments ,
and to cry over your absence and smile .
I exagger@@ ate myself that I will return soon ...
at the first anniversary of the de@@ tention of Bass@@ el wrote G@@ ha@@ zi :

history is not unique in Syria .
since the beginning of the protests of 2011 against the regime of Bas@@ har al @-@ Ass@@ ad , according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network on Human Rights ) has gone more than 65,@@ 000 people .
those who were arrested or de@@ filed under violence by the regime , were tor@@ tured or even executed .
from 2011 to 2016 , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nest@@ y International at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Sy@@ rer in Haf@@ t died .
the stories of many other people are unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community for 2012 has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el .
we repeat our demand in the hope that we have to do so for the last time .
Mos@@ ambi@@ que : because of corruption c@@ rank@@ ed director to prison quarters , return to previous post
Mos@@ ambi@@ cans re@@ acted with anger over a cor@@ rupt , in which a government member returned after half of his sentence in the workplace that the corruption was committed .
this was Di@@ o@@ dino Cam@@ ba@@ za , arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment in 2010 with four other def@@ endants ( around 800 000 Euro ) to 22 years imprisonment .
the money tri@@ b@@ ted from public funds of the airports of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , the Council of Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 because of good guidance and immediately requested his re @-@ setting in the company , which happened on April 19 , then .
in accordance with an opinion of the prosec@@ ut@@ or prosec@@ ution of the Republic , who would have the request , there would be no obstacles ground for Cam@@ ba@@ za to return to its old post as the company re@@ moved to his prison .
however , many citizens do not wish the action good .
the Center for Public integrity ( Centro de Int@@ eg@@ ri@@ da@@ de p@@ ú@@ bli@@ ca , shortly C@@ IP ) , a local institution committed to public transparency , condem@@ ned into an interview with Deutsche Welle the decision of the company to re@@ mark the director :
the absence of transparency in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a back@@ stage with regard to the efforts of our legal system , so the C@@ IP .
what we need to take note is that the company should have applied as an ex@@ propri@@ etary proceedings against the res@@ ellers .
however , the company apparently suggests and promp@@ ted no proper legal steps to apply the corresponding functions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the mos@@ ambitious social media , bor@@ row@@ ed this behaviour as well as regards the case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; resistance &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when Cam@@ ba@@ za would be a competent type , he would be advis@@ er after having been sentenced to a sentence .
he could keep paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he might give advice and his image pol@@ ishing .
but since it is in@@ competent , he has been hon@@ oured into being re@@ integrated into the company that he helped to cause damage .
therefore , it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za will be happy to pay for his silence .
resistance !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mos@@ ambi@@ cans and Student der Political Science in Brazil says , the director gives no moral :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was rewarded by the state because he revi@@ ved him , I cannot believe that someone was rewarded with such a way that has already vali@@ dated the state as massive .
Cam@@ ba@@ za is missing the mor@@ ality and serve the state , * he had already a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead it has only served by the state itself .
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as a hand it became an in@@ exhaus@@ tible money source and the state itself , this man has become we@@ ary , the pre @-@ loaded and finally condem@@ ned to a long adhesi@@ on .
honest@@ ly speaking , I don &apos;t know why this man was rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te preferred it , the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el to remember that a th@@ ief belongs to the prison :
diox@@ ins belong to the prison Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , the Moz@@ ambi@@ ans will not only be remembered as the first independent president , but also as a sharp , cat@@ chy , and - next to said - proph@@ etic speakers .
one of his most famous oral por@@ tra@@ y@@ als was , when he was energetic , that &quot; a ambitious man is capable of being able to sell the fa@@ ther@@ land for its ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest , to sell . &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that the tactics but it does not alter its ambi@@ tions .
an ambitious human being is at the same time crimin@@ ally . &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also dis@@ appoint@@ ing :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he sat on 10 years and was free .
and today he puts him in charge of the company with which he funds un@@ tre@@ aded , resume under contract . # As@@ sim@@ Vai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - я@@ ц@@ а.htm ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) 12 May 2017
Em@@ ild@@ o Sam@@ bo from the magazine @ Ver@@ da@@ de ( to dt . : @ Truth ) establishes that crime in Moz@@ ambi@@ que is paying :
in fact , in the Moz@@ ambi@@ que Di@@ eb and Di@@ ener of # Fre@@ lim@@ o pays off . # Di@@ o@@ dino Cam@@ ba@@ za to have been sentenced to long possible imprisonment , returns to the airports of Moz@@ ambi@@ que - Em@@ ild@@ o Sam@@ bo ( @ Em@@ ild@@ o@@ Sam@@ bo ) 11 May 2017
Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cen@@ sored many users to in@@ justice
the bur@@ mes@@ an word &quot; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &quot; means cast@@ ed or anti@@ quity .
photo of San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Wikipedia Commons , Creative Commons Attri@@ bution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ named
according to the information from Facebook @-@ users in Myanmar , the known Social Network took their Post@@ s from the net , because she did the word &quot; Kal@@ ar . &quot;
although the origin of the word is still being discussed , it is normally used to refer to people from the indi@@ an origin or in general as ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; In@@ dic@@ ally . &quot;
Facebook z@@ ensi@@ ert the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or take hold of it ( in Bur@@ m@@ eric script ) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of the ass@@ ass@@ ination in Burma during the social network .
in recent years the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely decrease .
in particular , it is a word which mostly used by Ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as an obstacle to Muslims , which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to fight , ass@@ ass@@ ination in Myanmar , the company has cen@@ sored a lot of sensu@@ al content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; may normally be associated with racism , but the word itself does not automatically calls hate speech .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that even Post@@ s in which they have discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubts concerning his use of usage , cen@@ sored .
moreover , there are several war@@ mes@@ an words with the different mean@@ ings that have the same character as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , chair is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words as &apos; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &apos; ( Sp@@ art@@ age ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar o@@ at &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos;@@ kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ n@@ User A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of one of my friends was deleted today because he enth@@ used the word Kal@@ ar .
however he was wonder@@ ed his friends on our spiritual kind , whether she watches it , how he could re@@ lie@@ ve his back pain by having a voc@@ abulary .
the proposition ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the ro@@ dent ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resem@@ bles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different .
there were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win h@@ eck is the opinion that they will reduce H@@ ass@@ language radic@@ ally nation@@ alists , but also pointed out that Facebook analytical his feet , before it dis@@ semin@@ ate all the in@@ dem@@ ons occurring in sus@@ pic@@ ion , racism .
Facebook lö@@ etes the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it fil@@ tering the word automatically .
the automati@@ call@@ m@@ atism is not understood what you can write on fac@@ ets .
what to do it instead is to analyse the post office carefully and control it by checking the adjacent words .
for example &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &quot; ( altern@@ ating ) .
the good is that these three @-@ story nation@@ alists will spread a rather good lesson .
now it is time to crop their nation@@ alism .
while the action may send a strong signal to everyone to dis@@ semin@@ ate the language , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long .
the experience of social networks in China like S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of keywords often will start a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks are simply going to use a new word or an alternative sp@@ elling of the cen@@ sored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to delete his Post@@ s when he wanted to tell his friends just that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; has bann@@ ed from the social network :
... when I was aware of this new directive of Facebook , I made a post to share my Facebook friends that is locked in word .
ir@@ on@@ ically , my post office has been removed from Facebook and I was prohibited the light , post and sharing of content for 24 hours , because the post office &quot; said the Facebook community standards . &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of Post@@ s from people who have no negative intentions or simply try to show their opinions against the H@@ ass@@ ing radi@@ k@@ aler nation@@ alists .
Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed , which has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without H@@ ass@@ speech from Facebook .
in the post , the author told his opinion on why extre@@ mis@@ m nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have more to do before the beginning of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese internet community for advice :
Facebook likes a ben@@ evol@@ ent purpose to reduce racism in Burma through their platform , but it does not work .
such words to be cen@@ sored will only bring more hat@@ red within the different communities .
in addition , it seems as if they have started without a local context or technical support , and as words as &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; inher@@ ited curr@@ y . &quot;
even when they found out that they have made mistakes , they tried to correct the fal@@ sely resolved Post@@ s .
if they would have only slightly more respect for the 15 million benefit they had a great deal of turnover , that would be great .
illustrated automatic to@@ ens@@ or@@ ship has taken care of a lot of spam under users .
instead of taking it seriously , users now take on Facebook funny and write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of salvation language to see if their Post@@ s are taken from the net .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook @-@ Post@@ s which were not un@@ covered , but nevertheless removed :
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads , &quot; I want to sit on a chair and watch an Indian film and watch an Indian film .
only to try out if Facebook lies the mail that contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the post sur@@ vey@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , do you heal people ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
in the past five years extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have used social networking to extend their votes and their influence .
among other things , envel@@ ope in social networks shall in addition to their communities in Myanmar with in addition , specially in the area Rak@@ h@@ ine where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have been forced to escape .
Facebook has been cri@@ tici@@ zed for his failure to con@@ ven@@ ed the benef@@ it@@ ative h@@ ass@@ ing on his bur@@ mes@@ an sites under control , cri@@ tici@@ zed .
but instead of simply the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; to c@@ ensi@@ vely , it would have better ongoing , rather on context rather than on code focused initiatives and learned of them .
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tobago is conclu@@ ding with the marriage marriage
a wedding ring in the sand .

the marriage before is in Trinidad and Tobago now illegal .
on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament of the country has un@@ anim@@ ously decided to un@@ anim@@ ously decided that this practice is to offer , so that the domestic age is now at 18 .
prior to this change of spouse , some members held Hin@@ du@@ ous and Muslim religious communities , and in May 2016 , brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of inter@@ religious organization ( I@@ RO ) , a group , representatives of the various religious groups of the country gathered for the state to not inter@@ ming@@ le the maturity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this happened regardless of the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contractual partner of the UN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Child Care Convention , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the min@@ ors as well , every person under the age of 18 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children that were married at 15 already in Trinidad and Tobago 2.8 percent , and with 18 were 8.@@ 1 percent .
in 2011 the statistical central office of the country confirmed that between 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married in 19 .
online @-@ peti@@ tions and social @-@ media movements that endeav@@ ors to create legislation on children &apos;s to@@ e , followed at the foot and do great support . without doubt they helped to bring this outcome .
nevertheless no everything went smoothly .
a Hin@@ du leader , Z. B. had no concerns to say the critics of the children &apos;s to@@ e , they should look after their own affairs . &quot;
this kind of religious opposition usually issued for tensions in this actually un@@ complicated thing , and sometime soon came to whether the opposition would ever agree to the legislative procedure .
yet at the beginning of 2017 the draft law was decided against the children &apos;s to@@ e - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent , that he could be discussed in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , where a simple majority share it for the law .
now only the President of the country has to agree with the law .
one of the sen@@ ators of the country gave us a Status update , which has posted Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ agram :
Mr. Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the draft law against the children &apos;s to@@ e was decided in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives with 35 votes for it and not only decided on it .
after having done before in the Senate , the draft can now become the law .
the majority of the Social @-@ Media @-@ User had been enth@@ r@@ alled because the laws of child@@ birth were finally changed .
Facebook @-@ member Lov@@ ell Francis , who held a minist@@ erial ministry in the Ministry of Education , said :
it has too much time and un@@ necessary s@@ well@@ ings used to quit the core of the thing , but do you know what ? the children &apos;s e is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago now illegal , and this is nearly worth every price .
while A@@ bel Jackson the opinion was , it was definitely long enough to finish the practice , Lara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas exagger@@ ated that the day was finally arrived :
public Status update on Facebook of Lara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which bes@@ es : , , Her@@ zo@@ rag@@ ing news !
the spouse has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 Works - 0 against ! ! ! ! &quot;
Fol@@ ding Mut@@ ota , who belong to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WIN@@ AD ) , a civil society group that said quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was , noted :
the local age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of the religious group of 18 years .
the draft to modification of the current network was adopted today , on 9 June 2017 .
in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , there are 41 members and of which were present in the voting rights .
all members who were against the law have agreed for the law .
the to@@ e is not permitted by law in Trinidad and Tobago .
it was a long battle ( ... ) # di@@ ge@@ age@@ age@@ ild@@ hood .
many thanks to all activi@@ sts who have fo@@ amed it out .
congratulations .
a Th@@ ank to our MEPs .
but a possible hook comes in the shape of sat Mahar@@ aja , therefore , the Secretary @-@ General of the San@@ è@@ d@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du organization of the country .
months ago Mahar@@ aja has proclaimed his intention to undertake the court @-@ oriented steps , the law should be passed and he seems to have his promises .
during the general contrac@@ tor Paris Al ra@@ wi , a dis@@ agreement of the law , said , it was entirely law@@ ful , if Mahar@@ aja against the law would move , the most social media users would go differently from the issue .
Patricia Wor@@ rell hit the site :
dear Sat , if we , instead of discussing the discussion so general , in a way that , only panic and in@@ ants would be able to talk that the state to protect our daughters , that they may be of great , hard @-@ minded men who are against them in advantage , would be dis@@ astro@@ us , would you be ready to continue the discussion ?
or do you think it is not a problem ?
however , whether it comes to a judicial approach against the law or not , these legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where children &apos;s to@@ e are legal or continue to the norm although there are laws that they tell .

through the sp@@ ies of web pages , Turkish users can view Wikipedia @-@ contents
the English @-@ language Wikipedia page was presented on 18 January 2012 , oppos@@ ing the SO@@ PA ( stop Online Privacy Act ) and PI@@ PA copyright laws in the US , internationally updated .
written by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for over a month now Turkey has released the popular and crow@@ ds@@ ourcing principle @-@ based enz@@ y@@ clo@@ pedia Wikipedia .
day by day becomes evident , how important the platform for users is to find helpful and reliable information .
both students as well as re@@ por@@ ters and fans of TV @-@ series c@@ rank against the rejection .
although many techn@@ ologi@@ zed internet users are used to use poll@@ ing tools for blocking websites ( an up @-@ to @-@ date article from the New York Times reported that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ val@@ ence of the world ) , the most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has posted articles from Wikipedia since 2008 , as recently published in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harv@@ ard University , find regular block@@ ages on the Internet since 2007 , after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted .
to China , Turkey is the most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of Wikipedia .
while the platform continues to be locked , there are now several mir@@ r@@ or@@ sides ( pages , which reflect the contents of Wikipedia and frequently updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform leads all Turkish Wikipedia pages on the de@@ centralized pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( so machine computers ) which does not base itself on the system of domain names and thus making a complete c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship difficult .
the content is available in spite of law@@ ful pro@@ hibition .
in a blog post , IP@@ FS tells about his efforts :
once we have heard the news ( about the block@@ age of Wikipedia ) we put everything in mind , snap@@ shots of Wikipedia on the IP@@ FS platform . thus , the possibility to read the content on de@@ centralized and distributed in ways .
this can help users to get at least all Wikipedia content even if you cannot achieve the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.org .
IP@@ FS was also given that this step was done independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is merely a screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the web page .
however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to handle the lock .
Cr@@ istian Con@@ son@@ ni from Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , a Mir@@ r@@ or@@ page of Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ mir@@ rors , an open source project that everyone can use to host similar characteristics , if in the respective country Wikipedia is blocked .

it is not a complete copy of a proxy server , a mirror .
one acc@@ esses on a different URL that is not the original one is . that what can be seen then is from Wikipedia .
essentially the server dire@@ cts the request to the right Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia even if they are blocked in Turkey .
for this is executed by a server that is not in Turkey .

at that time he was still a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar , N@@ ept@@ une stri@@ ves to bring N@@ ept@@ une to the international scene at the age of 28 .
and his homeland right next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offering him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that guide the attention to Nep@@ ali animal world .
he described on Facebook how he helps him with his first @-@ class position in his work :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could it be better for a passionate wildlife photograph@@ ers ! !
I just rested at home when I suddenly Navar@@ re ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) . he had received a call from my Father , that on the banks of the Rap@@ ti river would be a le@@ op@@ ard .
the river dam@@ m is just a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately , I got on with my camera and was in a few minutes there .
my father had wat@@ ched him and showed me the place on the other river side , where the le@@ op@@ ard was up and I immediately began to cr@@ ush pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar seeks co @-@ operation with the authorities to achieve global recognition for N@@ ept@@ une and wants to deep@@ en the understanding of how wild animals are not so terrible , as they may look .
and he should know , for he was tig@@ ers already face to face to face :
a tiger can not inter@@ f@@ ere with the opinion of the sheep in sleeping ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
also I was standing by the darkness on the way home , when suddenly the king of the Bu@@ har@@ ks appeared . he immediately sat down , we see ourselves and he died through the Sal @-@ trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar the logo &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit . : I cli@@ cked on environmental protection ) on his photos .
however , his passion for the encour@@ agement of Nep@@ ali nature and wild animals is not always easy .
he wa@@ ited for 22 days long , and mostly lived in a tent to make up the Bar@@ dia National Park recording of Ot@@ tern . up to 12 days it lasted until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds who live near the tourist tax .
take a look at some of these photos below .

this entry was composed by Kay@@ ona@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning media organization from India .
a revised version was published here as part of a content sharing agreement .
in many parts of India there are women with great care to address the name of their wives , or even older men in the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead , they use a pron@@ oun or say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pr@@ ad@@ esh give women to respect her husband &apos;s social pressure , as well as fear of the consequences they should be mis@@ informed this practice on life .
last year Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was condem@@ ned out of the Indian State O@@ dish@@ a by a hypo@@ z@@ court and ch@@ ased by her family and the village community , after having addressed a hal@@ ted relative with name .
the tradition of her spouse also does not call upon their names , is also common among men . however , they have much less to fear , if at all , they should not escape this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , appeared nine women , including health care as well as home@@ work , a unique club and were therefore quickly the main topic of the city .
it is a place for them alone where they can discuss and discuss the int@@ ric@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
as one of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the Community Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and campa@@ ign@@ ing for the dismant@@ ling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ has been working with the help of its vide@@ oc@@ am@@ era for seven years with the aid of practices , such as children &apos;s marriage until the exile of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected parties , and guides these clubs .
she reports about how this club have created a safe place for these women and at the same time they have made the amb@@ assador of the change at the same time .
the first video , the Roh@@ ini showed in its discussions , acted by women who did not name their wives .
she decided on this issue because she wanted to open the conversation about Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem that women can easily identify with .
in fact , the name of her husband did not speak out loud is a bro@@ ker that they maintain all the fee @-@ guilty and never asked questions .
Roh@@ ini believes :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman is respected her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who did not keep it , is treated as a s@@ ly , as a woman without mor@@ als .
the tradition is so deeply ro@@ oted that we have never thought about this discussion .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband before the name , at home , how it works .
she showed the video of the discussion with her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband was temp@@ ted for a long time after the video was at the end .
Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said , I was asking him from now on by his name .
with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage , she started their first discussion club .
many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; has never heard before . some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pr@@ ad@@ esh .
after the vide@@ o@@ projection the women examined the discussion with a exercise in motion .
Roh@@ ini asked each participant in the name of her husband with various emotions - happy , anno@@ yed , sad , loving and so on .
then she asked them all , &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our husband , but they can call us how they want it means that they do not respect us ?
should it be not equal ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when she brought the name of her husband over the lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was out of the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra over the break of a centuries @-@ old tradition , in which married women could never inter@@ ven@@ ed the name of her husband .
Roh@@ ini tells :
a woman was so timi@@ d that she decided during the whole exercise just before themselves ; one another decided to go out the whole tre@@ mul@@ ated fru@@ stration against him and his family by cur@@ sed him .
the expression on their faces was ek@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
still in ad@@ ren@@ alin rush along with an ancient bri@@ cks to have broken down the women that they would actually try to name her husband to name their name .
and they held their word .
in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a multitude of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas they put in the head : his wife could not cease to tell his name .
another club member decided to do it during the dinner prior to the entire family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law she died , she was afraid and said that there was an error .
another woman said , &quot; Roh@@ ini said , I was doing it . &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understand@@ ably and the situation no@@ d@@ ete in violence .
raw materials reported as women have tried to stop other practices , such as the wearing of the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dots on the forehead , which indicates the spouse :
why do women have to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband that I would bear the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ Red Point even if he also acts .
he laugh@@ ed only and I heard to bear it .
the other women have not completely list@@ ened to them , but they think they are now in a better position , even to vote in some days not to bear .
for many women the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange views and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip on each discussion club . &quot; &quot; &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go beyond the field .
I don &apos;t want to worry that women could make sure what could hear , &quot; she says .
in recent months she celeb@@ rates her own birth@@ days with cakes ; they d@@ anced and s@@ angen and spoke about things that they had never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I also have some things , for example as our identi@@ ties to our wife , never so honest spoken .
it feels great to say certain things out loud , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion , we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing .
some women in the group have had only Sar@@ is since their Savi@@ our .
for most is the okay , but some wanted a sal@@ ty @-@ c@@ ta , a wide shirt over a p@@ ants that they have not d@@ ressed .
after a lot of dispute and discussion of the advantages of their own clothes @-@ selection , mor@@ ality is connected to the Sar@@ is and much more , sh@@ mu@@ te Roh@@ ini her own couple of Kur@@ ta ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) in a discussion section so that the women could wear them .
next , they now decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can carry je@@ ans and raw materials is certain that they will manage it .
on the question of whether in the five months since their first discussion club has already been altered , the Roh@@ ini confirms that things are slowly coming into roles :
we have only done small steps so far .
some women pro@@ bi@@ ased it a few times but heard then again on the name of her husband to say .
some , including me , make it yet , but only if they are alone and no other family members are there .
only one or two continue to say the name of their husband ; only one or two women bear now at any time in Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their forehead .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the f@@ ender to lie more freedom of movement or in their own clos@@ ets - at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
as they give each other self @-@ confidence , they will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how the Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a victim of patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am also it .
but this club gives each one of us confidence that something will change .
and I know that there is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction if every woman is going home in the club and other people about what we are talking about and what we do .
we are all sitting in the same boat .

a new system of ab@@ duction of gl@@ atz@@ kö@@ ping people for the organ@@ iser , probably for su@@ pers@@ ti@@ tious conditions , trou@@ bled the police of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , a province in Moz@@ ambi@@ que . the local government now called a series of operations to life to stop the Prak@@ tik .
at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the bor@@ ough district , a few kilometres from the border to Mal@@ awi .
one of the victims was revealed and part of the organs were taken .
two men have been arrested and found in the wake up that the organs of sh@@ aman can be used in Tanzania and Mal@@ awi .
there are the local su@@ pers@@ ti@@ tions that the head of a glorious man &apos;s gold was able to bring gold un@@ old or wealth , explained the police pre@@ view@@ finder from Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia from the BBC .
it is the first time that consecutive attacks on hard @-@ four men were registered in Moz@@ ambi@@ que .
another group , the purpose of murder for ob@@ sc@@ ure purposes is people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the fact that the UN in the South African country conducted a mission to investigate these intern@@ alise .
the persecution of people with Al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of Southern Africa , particularly in neighboring Tanzania , where the government has developed campaigns to fight this su@@ pers@@ ti@@ tions and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the town of Map@@ uto .

attention to k@@ ah@@ le men who are in Moz@@ ambi@@ que the goal of the ambi@@ que men in Moz@@ ambi@@ que are the goal of ritu@@ alistic attacks , war@@ ned the mos@@ ambi@@ valent police after the recent ass@@ ination of three gl@@ az@@ ed men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the v@@ ests took place .
Hus@@ ky Lag@@ y Ad@@ amo , student and residents of the city of In@@ ham@@ bane in the south of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , said that the local police already de@@ ed the case :
PR@@ M believes that the pu@@ aman is involved in the death of the glorious men .
the persecution and ass@@ ass@@ ent of gl@@ uten @-@ ups for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , province of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , has considered cultural motives and is considered by the traditional sh@@ aman into consideration ( PR@@ M ) which also indicates that a faith it existed , according to which the sacrifice in the head would have power , the rich@@ es generated .
in the last days three men were killed with hair loss problems in this part of the country .
Angela Fer@@ re@@ ira Saman@@ tha told on Facebook the chron@@ icle of the Blo@@ gg@@ ers poor Sn@@ ai@@ pp@@ a , who pointed out that the problem is part of the greater social difficulties that Moz@@ ambi@@ que is facing :
I would like to ask E@@ IN Moz@@ ambi@@ que , TH@@ AT A country where people would have shame to go on the road and others do not viol@@ ate sex with good notes , work and other achievements , a nation in which neither the al@@ bin@@ os nor k@@ ah@@ le or wh@@ o@@ ep for the unbeliev@@ ing purposes or &quot; black magic , &quot; that aim is to reach the quick@@ est wealth .

a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia that was probably only recently made .
this story was originally published on 8 July 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the ar@@ rest of Chinese dis@@ si@@ dents Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has drawn attention in the international community , after its attorney in late June had been announced that he was delivered to hospital treatment in the final stage .
in 2009 Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state endang@@ ering ) , after being involved in the draft of the charter 08 , a manifest@@ o that contributed the democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the No@@ bel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the State Department in China has called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an internal matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and one speaker , he referred to it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not required to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless China will continue to receive views from the international community , the Nob@@ el@@ p@@ rei@@ sträger and his wife , Dich@@ ter Li@@ u X@@ ia , release or give it a treatment abroad .
while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely extinct .
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
united nations
Shows , the High Com@@ miss@@ ar of the United Nations for Human Rights , met at the end of June Chinese officials to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
a spok@@ es@@ person ref@@ used to comment whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to allow Li@@ u abroad a treatment abroad .
Norway
Norwegian &apos;s prime minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ing have ref@@ used to answer questions about Li@@ us liberation .
the relationship between China and Norway returns to Li@@ u , after the No@@ bel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian government dis@@ hur@@ ried that this eventually has nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were continued until the end of December last year . only in June Norway , Norway signed an agreement to resume the sal@@ mon on China , since the exports were largely blocked since 2010 .
after hearing the message that Li@@ u had seriously fallen , the No@@ bel Committee brought its hope for an un@@ unconditional release to the expression and lu@@ d Li@@ u , to pick up his prize in Oslo .
due to its adh@@ er@@ ence he was not able to take his prize .
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on July 6th , the European Parliament adopted a decision in which China has been promp@@ ted to free Li@@ u and his wife to free from the house rest and allow him to seek medical support where he wants .
the leaders of the EU , Federica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , called for China also for the release of Li@@ us , as they divided into an explanation on 30 June :
at the same time , China expect all the limitations of Mr. Li@@ us &apos;s wife as well as family members .
they should meet all the visits and receive , who wish them and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
USA , Canada
us Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ for@@ ties shared with that the Americans &quot; wish him to have the opportunity for treatment abroad as it may help him in his comrades . &quot;
a spok@@ es@@ person of the U.S. Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the Message agency AF@@ P on 27 June , not only release the message , not only Li@@ u , but also to liber@@ ate his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from her household rest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the invitation of the US Embassy moved a fur@@ ious response from China to himself , with the utter@@ ance of the Ministry of Finance , that &quot; no country have the right to inter@@ f@@ ere and un@@ responsible comments on Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley told that China should offer the couple :
protection and freedom , such as travel freedom and access to medical care of his choice , to which they have made according to Chinese Constitution and legal system as well as international obligations .
the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , J@@ eff Mer@@ kl@@ ey and T@@ ed Cruz also introduced a decision in congress to push the Chinese government to push the Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condi@@ tionally .

Germany , Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Government of Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on 3 July , Berlin hope that Li@@ u &quot; gets &quot; all the medical assistance he needs &quot; and that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G@@ 20 Summit in Hamburg .
previously reported diplomatic sources in Beijing of the news agency re@@ ters that China had great concerns if the vor@@ tices could over@@ look around Li@@ u the visit in Hamburg .
Canada
on 28 June the Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ around China called on to provide adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to worry about his family .
Li@@ us attorney told AF@@ P previously , that Li@@ us wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia that could visit him every day , but the police always super@@ vised the room in the hospital and that there is Li@@ u not permitted , with someone outside , including his law@@ yers , to speak and contact .
Mc@@ Call@@ um tells you more :
Canada calls on China to release his international human rights obligations , including free speech , to maintain true and responsible for the exercise of these rights .
France
the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs ordered China in a Declaration on 29 June to release the Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o will receive all treatments that he , regardless of where , needs his wife and his family to have contact with him .
although the message sender . France has already reported that the French government Li@@ u would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the State Department gave no further information out whether France will eventually take him .
Taiwan
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of the ceremony in Taiwan requested China on June 27th to release the Li@@ u and demand a greater tolerance to those who need peaceful resources to challenge political reforms and democratic development . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tai@@ w@@ anese Foundation of Yu Me@@ i @-@ nu from the ruling Democratic Pro@@ gress Party , China also called on to permit the c@@ ran@@ ged intellectual Li@@ u to let yourself be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed herself to be very concerned in an explanation on 28 June by Li@@ u and gave that many people asked him to pray for Li@@ us well @-@ being .
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is my faith that he took and had been strict pun@@ ished for which he had been ri@@ gor@@ ously led to a harmon@@ ious , stable and we@@ al@@ thy China , which in turn has contributed to a peaceful world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt personally very moved and also encouraged , when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tu@@ als and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stu@@ pid since Singapore is recognized as an independent state .
but according to the Minister @-@ Minister K. Shan@@ gr@@ e , Singapore should be considered as a town .
this re@@ mark has triggered a debate in the blog@@ osph@@ ere debate .
during the meeting , during the meeting of the meeting of the International Zwei@@ gs of the Association New York , the Minister that many people ar@@ gue the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because it is compared with other countries .
he supported that Singapore should be seen as a city .
... nobody asked if New York is a democracy ...
this is what most people make a mistake .
I tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o described the Minister of Justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twi@@ sting the logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend the existing author@@ it@@ arian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , according to all our efforts and sacrific@@ es to create this valuable land , we can say that we ultimately be no country .
it so@@ unded as vul@@ gar , it had the sem@@ bl@@ ance of a flight before the responsibilities .
Singapore , if you are not my country , Wh@@ ose land is it then ?
the reasons listed by Shan@@ gr@@ e were not very no@@ ble : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal lands , in view of its , he appeared to inev@@ it@@ ably un@@ democratic .
in contrast , he def@@ ends the idea that Singapore with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York should be compared to equally cities that are permanently removed from a party .
these cities are democratic .
once you reach the core point of the topic , the good old ly@@ re has been reached from author@@ it@@ arian rulers , leaving the twi@@ sted logic , as they adapt better to their power .
in the end of the year , the answers to his American guests were given to his American guests with respect to our press , our J@@ udi@@ k@@ ative , our political system really no response .
appropriate questions tar@@ nte he with non @-@ responses will be ration@@ ale .
Rachel Z@@ eng has promp@@ ted Shan@@ gr@@ e to see his opinion , because they did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to read .
when Singapore is not a country , but a city is , thus to which country belongs to our city ...
short , I understand nothing .
I would be very grateful if our wer@@ ter K Shan@@ gr@@ e would take on the effort to clarify this point unless he was paid very much to be part of the Government of Singapore .
by clicking on the blog , he pointed out about the reviews that one should begin to read the entire review of the conference so that you can better understand the context of the statements of Shan@@ gr@@ e to better understand , according to which Singapore is a city and no country .
read the trans@@ cript .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said , Singapore is rather a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a country &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; stated why the elections in Singapore were so un@@ equal , even if we are looking forward free and fair elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he played Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party to win a party ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said , Singapore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not a country &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he obviously does not have it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his disappointment about Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am , which makes a leader of a growing generation , such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement .
I am over what the Minister of Justice in Singapore said , very embarrass@@ ed ...
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard , which expects me - may I dis@@ agree with them or not , but this is another thing .
but with K. Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am , a member of the new generation of political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure whether he really believes that he is truly aware of what he def@@ ends .
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review submitted the weak points of Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ ams argum@@ ent@@ ers :
&quot; &quot; &quot; has Mr Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; goo@@ der a mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was it a fre@@ ud@@ scher speakers ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Singapore is not a country , we will only be regarded as independent and sovereig@@ n state ?
if not , to which country go back the sovereig@@ n rights of the city of Singapore ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally land and city .
as he plays an important role within the government of the interior , the statements of Mr. Shan@@ gr@@ e are of serious importance .
why does the Lon@@ urer do their military service , they defend only their city but do not defend their country ?
whom must our prime minister rep@@ ay ?
what is the value of our pink HR certificate ?
are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the magazine Jour@@ ney of a decade to the affir@@ mation , Singapore and was always a city : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I did not say what I said ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this set does not seem to have anno@@ yed many treasures ...
nobody ever has said that Singapore is a country .
we always were a city .
we have always been a city / archipelago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defense of the country especially &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but that &apos;s not quite true . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should speak more of the defence of the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the my@@ th of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice Kan@@ adi@@ ators &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Canadian NED flan@@ ges .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices asked about short of his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or home country ?
your answers are published here as part of a continuing series , with the rum@@ ors of certain parts of the world , and another fac@@ et should be shown .
the latest part of this series origin@@ ates from Nev@@ is Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
the question which is posed to me in Japan is : &quot; are you American ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , I am sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1994 I live and again in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on the situation the conversation takes place , it is considered to be polite , interest in his inter@@ loc@@ ut@@ or by providing personal questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on my clari@@ fications , the standard response follows : &quot; Oh , Rock@@ y Mountains , ice @-@ ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many Canadi@@ ans cook perhaps swe@@ dish from anger if they are held for Americans but don &apos;t b@@ other me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for someone who does not know , there is little that the Canadi@@ ans diff@@ ers from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans get a Canadian banner only visible at its back@@ pack whenever they travel .
all love Kan@@ adi@@ er .
Americans on the other hand ... .
so it was even when I began 20 years ago to travel through the world - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the march in Iraq and September 11th .
Canadi@@ ans have always worn small A@@ hor@@ n@@ ets at their luggage to differ from their amer@@ ican neighbours .
we have a free health care !
for us there is no weapons !
gender equality in Canada have already been legal since 2005 !
all seem to think , Canada is so great .
we are polite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we obviously say very often &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is also said to be the toler@@ ant country facing ethnic groups .
we are not like these types south of the border .
we Kan@@ adi@@ er are nice .
I hate this .
first , I have many American friends I ad@@ mi@@ red .
there would be nothing if you would like to conf@@ use me for example with Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
but there are also some problems with the stamps &quot; nice . &quot;
first , referred to as &quot; nice , &quot; said , basically , like the goo@@ gle , gentle , but trag@@ ically , un@@ important figure of Flan@@ ders from &quot; The Simp@@ son &quot; ( who has a own Canadian Doppel@@ gänger ) .
if Canada would really be a nation full of people like NED Flan@@ ders , this would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; no personality has .
there are no corners and edges , nothing where you can encounter .
harm@@ less to be in@@ con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous and in@@ interesting and not to earn attention .
this can be something good if you want to remain un@@ noticed in the background , far away from the things that pass around one .
I would even go far as far as to say that the desire to be free and alone , a main building of the Canadian .
we tend to take care of our own affairs only .
what out@@ si@@ ders as &quot; nice , &quot; is perhaps just cool pol@@ it@@ eness .
Canadi@@ ans are not often talking about the fence .
us l@@ acks the warm , open friendliness that I have now binding with my American friends .
luck@@ ily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) then J@@ ustin Tru@@ deau entered the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada almost sexy .
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ odi@@ zed Thai &apos;s Jun@@ ta
one in Thailand famous Pop @-@ Band has released a music video which was par@@ odi@@ zed the Jun@@ ta and restoring the civil government in spite of its promises , the country continues to rule the country .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells them which rules make him his girlfriend .
although not specifically political , the music video refers directly to the lasting military rule of the Jun@@ ta .
the band was pra@@ ised by many fans and others for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video of the song was a great success .
in the first three days alone , it was shared on Facebook up@@ loaded video 1.@@ 254 and received 8.@@ 800 l@@ kes .
last month it was even blocked the Charlie @-@ Chap@@ lin video &quot; The dict@@ ator &quot; in Thailand after a group of activi@@ sts stri@@ pped to watch this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to the Thai policy as it beha@@ ves with the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule .
look at once again these shots of the videos that are related to some of the political issues that Thailand have been prosec@@ uted in the past three years .
the &quot; 44 rules of girls &quot; refers to the dra@@ ined part 44 of the provisi@@ onal constitution , which grants the Ober@@ be@@ ech , absolute decision @-@ making authority over important national issues .
the 11 rule : &quot; changed your attitude &quot; refers to the de@@ generated program for &quot; inser@@ tion change &quot; by journalists , students , scientists , activi@@ sts , politicians and other individuals who are viewed by the jun@@ ta as critics .
the image above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose v@@ age and un@@ clear rules are often used by the authorities in order to dis@@ regard activi@@ sts and other critics of the state .
for this purpose a new unit set up in the army has also been super@@ vised by the online content and those who dis@@ car@@ ded , the mon@@ archy is persec@@ uted , criminal prosec@@ uted .
Thailand continues a Stri@@ ke against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ est@@ ead ) .
on 20 May 2014 the war has been established in Thailand .
two days later it came to a cou@@ p of the army .
one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to follow , their decision is expensive sub@@ marine boats , although security sex@@ es they war@@ ned that the purchase is un@@ necessary and a waste of tax suffered .
in the video even shown how people are thrown into a black stor@@ ing device before going into an Inter@@ ni@@ fier , another problem .
some journalists are in prison , because they alleg@@ edly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and will cause internet us@@ us@@ ers long ar@@ rests , they should occupy the mon@@ archy .
meanwhile the te@@ aser of the song members of the band who have been using the Sal@@ ut of &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em &quot; im@@ it@@ ated , who has already been used by pl@@ aster opponents during the protests in 2014 .

the post @-@ war company recovered only very slowly in East @-@ East Asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
over 20 years have passed since the Georgi@@ an @-@ abstract war officially ended , but his s@@ cars are still strongly visible in this part of the Republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern districts in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking pictures .
villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ ht@@ a , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in the carbon basin of Ab@@ ba@@ an .
various ethnic groups like Russians , Greeks , de@@ terr@@ as , Georgi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together to so@@ vie@@ ti@@ ties in the area .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today , most of them live in the area today .
such settlements are also called gh@@ ost towns as well .
in the pre @-@ war period , there were more than 10.000 people , today there are only a few hundred people living in these s@@ cap@@ itals .
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 the total population of the district of 16.@@ 000 people was barely increased by over a decade .
1989 approximately 40,@@ 000 people lived in this district .

the empty five @-@ story @-@ blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960 &apos;s , called Chr@@ is@@ usch@@ t@@ schu@@ etz@@ kas are symbolic of the decline and the devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are falling apart and rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native elderly man .
he starts a conversation and it is hard to quit this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why talk ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is still unique . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in front of the war the village was full of life .
there were community centres , schools and kinder@@ gartens , all of the community .
now , there is only paved road with infl@@ atable glory @-@ Build@@ ings .
the people who were once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central plan economy of the Soviet Union , have left the district by now .
in the Gei@@ ster@@ stadt D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha almost fifty inhabitants live .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the chron@@ us@@ ht@@ a , who still faces one or two families , you can recognize on the balconies , where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me with the camera in his hand , they immediately retreat .
&quot; our Mother has bann@@ ed us that we let ourselves photograph , &quot; says one of the girls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she is simply forbidden , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ per@@ ed her girlfriend and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and van@@ ish .
many people in the area are working for a small Turkish mining companies named T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the Sub@@ sist@@ ence industry ( cultivation of agricultural products ) such as animal breeding , be@@ eke@@ eping and vegetable @-@ cultivation .
it is difficult to come across the l@@ aps .
the District administration supplies for free candles and bread in the villages .

about ten years ago a old woman moved with the name Gal@@ ina ( or a@@ unt G@@ alya , as it is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Jab@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
despite her most ancient daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina does not leave from Ab@@ sin@@ Asia to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever in the Asian @-@ Asian , &quot; tells them .
Gal@@ ina wants to accept no financial aid from her daughter and insi@@ sts that she instead supports her young grand@@ son .
Gal@@ inas month &apos;s monthly r@@ ents are just nine dollars .
&quot; if you do not have a vegetable garden , nor a house , it is very hard to survive , &quot; gives them too .

&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; calls T@@ ante G@@ alya ye too . &quot; you said we could squ@@ ash zu@@ cch@@ ini .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark road or few people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is possible to get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
but actually it has something to do with pl@@ ot@@ ings .
after the war there was little work and everyone lived as it was right .
I remember how the city and the war were once . &quot;
as our conversation to the end , a little boy refers to us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hidden .
a ball flies from the window and another boy j@@ ails to him back .
he plays with the ball , which cros@@ ses the hill .
a group of children now tracks the ball .
whilst they run , some of them throw them on the falling building .
these ruins are a part of their childhood , which care for in@@ estim@@ ation in their lives .

in Mexico &quot; Mama Africa , &quot; migrants are living on their long journey
Concepción Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez runs a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border from Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by Amy Br@@ acken was published on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and published here with friendly permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the path of migrants , to cross Europe or Latin America certain places are known for their hospitality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he is located on the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is led by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican , a small woman with a cor@@ als @-@ rosa Brill@@ en@@ gest@@ ell and gol@@ d@@ coloured ear@@ rings in t@@ ed@@ dy @-@ shaped form .
it is called Concepción Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . however , they know a lot under the name of Mama Africa .
this nickname is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tian that are on the passage .
the hotel does not have any charm .
for about 2.50 dollars the night sleep the guests in simple rooms , with cold , cr@@ um@@ bling walls and beds made of metal .
there is a par@@ rot in a c@@ age in a c@@ age .
there is no gu@@ ide@@ post to the hotel - yet hundreds of African and local immigrants arrive here .
sometimes , Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez , the people tells Ram@@ í@@ rez , the people come to full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast to call them : &quot; m@@ om Africa !
where are you Mama Africa ? &quot;
currently it is rather quiet but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has already received 200 guests at a time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have also slept on cart@@ ons .
it would not want to refuse anyone .
they also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick , they buy them drugs that they do not pay them , they mass@@ aged them with a bal@@ m taken from the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived in a short time ago .
I asked him whether M@@ om Africa has a reasonable nickname for Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the Sebasti@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i who has a Jo@@ gh@@ ur@@ bart ) posi@@ ert with Concepción Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to get to Boston .
photo : Amy Br@@ acken .
&quot; yes , &quot; yes , &quot; answers with a smile . &quot; I really feel that it suits you , because African women are very nice women .
very loving .
she has the cordi@@ ality of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister , who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children .
they have already lived in Brazil , however , it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to move normally a first stop in South America and then to the north .
the family had heard of other ri@@ vals from Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a known name on the track , &quot; explained Felix Mich@@ elet , a guest from Haiti .
he tells that the Hai@@ tian and Afri@@ cans often travel together the stretch and that the Afri@@ cans have already been talking to W@@ hat@@ s@@ App from Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
how many of his companion , Mich@@ elet has lived in Brazil in advance and worked as a buil@@ ders on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy was we@@ aker , he began his journey into the United States .
he has been a guest for Mama Africa : he s@@ ells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the B@@ usti@@ tes to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him whether he will have contact with Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Afrika is our mother and we never let them go again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always keep in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez tells us that their guests are often sending text messages , when they are gone to greet them or to report them over the course of their journey .
she declares that her Christian faith is the drive of her work .
she does not know much about Africa , but their guests have expressed their lives , ch@@ ick@@ ens as in Ghana .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps known here , but it is not the only spar@@ king hope for the migrants that travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city a dead @-@ end path leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Val@@ en@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter Val@@ en@@ zu@@ ela and his family have taken migrants in their small house .
he is pol@@ z@@ ist and has found that the B@@ usti@@ ckets will be sold to numerous African migrants .
he started to help them get a reasonable price then he has offered them his house for one dollar spent the night .
for the moment 25 people are da , mainly Hai@@ tian .
some sleep on blank@@ ets on the ground , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a kitchen out outside .
Val@@ en@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I lived in the United States &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he tells you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have experienced what they experience . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others not help . this is the reason why I give them my support . &quot;
after having lived for three years , he was moved out of the United States after a raid .
the majority of migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other inhabitants also open the doors of their houses for them .
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ én@@ dez tells me that he had fled in Honduras with his wife and his three children from people who wanted to get money out of him without a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for an accommodation and a well @-@ known , an all@@ evi@@ ate attrac@@ ting , has offered him her roof .
a few months later the family lives still here and she tries to decide where the next steps should go .
back in the house of Mama Africa is all again full of guests .
in the courses , the travellers are watching their phones .
a mini@@ bus has arrived and has got 20 new guests , a large majority of Somalia .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that their house is full , but it is also no@@ st@@ alg@@ ically , because of those who have gone away .
like a proud grand@@ mother she glim@@ pse in her album with numerous photos .
there is one of her daughter with African hair fl@@ atter@@ ies that you had a manifestation , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old .
they laugh@@ s sad , while she presents me shortly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ya se fu@@ eron &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; repeat every time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are already gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang citizens are comp@@ elled to install on their phones a surveillance app .
a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang from Twitter users who has failed to take care of
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , a ethnic minorities in the West of China , are comp@@ elled to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones .
on 10 July the phone users received at Tian@@ shan District of the city of Ur@@ um@@ qi , a cell al@@ erts where it has the District government to install a surveillance app called Jing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Final Cleaning ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the communication , the app is said to get access to terrorist information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , col@@ ò@@ n@@ ated the authorities will also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism .
according to an exclusive report of Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were captured in the autonom@@ ous autonom@@ ous Pre@@ f@@ ecture , because they were shortly after they had changed the app , messages with a private white @-@ chat group .
in the communication of the police , the app would identify the sources and the distribution paths of terrorists and pursue , together with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ books and documents .
Jing@@ w@@ ang website describes the app as follows :
Jing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ ang@@ u T@@ elec@@ om .
the main function is the blocking por@@ no@@ graphic websites , from online fraud , Tro@@ jan and ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online , and to control their own home network .
this app has the filter for min@@ ors to help the children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can naturally be used in many ways .
for example , the &apos; remote control &quot; state actors or even h@@ ackers have to manipul@@ ate the home network of a person or ste@@ al from it .
this introduction is consistent with other measures to take control of digital activities in this region .
while announ@@ cements on digital c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in China usually focus on the experience of users in larger cities in the east and south , the reality is very often d@@ ü@@ st@@ er for those who live in remote , sec@@ ular ethnic minority regions like X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
to limit dis@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in the conflict areas , the authorities identify extreme c@@ ens@@ ors and monitoring measures as well as rout@@ in@@ ly Internet isolation .

sleep or death , part 1 : anything scre@@ am after death
a single @-@ cell in Old Du@@ b@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo by : Cor@@ rie Bar@@ kli@@ more ( CC B@@ Y 2.0 ) .
this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; sleep or death &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane signs his experiences in an Syrian prison .
far from our blue , virtual world look at you and ask you that you &apos;re totally alone in one place where all is important .
everything has gradually resolved and a truth un@@ covered , which is clearly recogni@@ z@@ able , both inside and outside .
one which makes her name all honor .
one who has be@@ aten in a list of qing and expres@@ sions that do not allow met@@ aph@@ ors .
but when you see the reality again and you look behind the scenes - beyond the show , the beautiful scen@@ eries and the performers - turn the characters into beings from flesh and blood , and all sh@@ ou@@ ting to death .
all doubts solve in smoke and you become aware of your existence even if the Earth moves up on the axis of the we@@ dge . dir is clear that you &apos;re caught here between the walls that your parents , and before them put your grand@@ parents , stone by stone .
they have been arrested myself and my father three times , but this was not yet , so that I formulated &quot; my lesson , &quot; as the boss of the security services it formed - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he set his power over us under evidence by even destro@@ ying the sim@@ pl@@ est concepts that we known .
five young people were killed during a peaceful prot@@ tests like weed from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
it came out to make the city the darkness of the night with &quot; All &apos;@@ ahu ac@@ bar &quot; scre@@ ams .
all the neighborhood came to my own , just my own .
for the first time it was quiet , rainy , at the wrong time , even though I did not put high demands on a city that is up to the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces .
during the third night things had cal@@ med down things after hearing the power supply in the district .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I crossed the still@@ ness by cr@@ ying several times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All &apos;@@ ahu &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of my house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice through the silence res@@ ound .
a few minutes later , some of my friends were bra@@ ve enough to co @-@ together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends closed to me ; we con@@ formed to a magnific@@ ant image that fully met my expectations .
in such a moment will become aware that you liber@@ ate the Spirit from the lamp , but it is simply not interested in cont@@ ing@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my Father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; makes you ready , we meet with the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he put on .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can lower , nothing can give you your voice back after you have the whole path to the office of the security service from the body .
I came there .
the col@@ on@@ gh@@ an stood there with several of his men : my father was already there , as I was now .
the Ob@@ erst gh@@ ass@@ an begins to speak : &quot; let me hear me like you &apos;@@ All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &apos;@@ schre@@ y , or you are only cour@@ ageous enough to cry out if we are not near . &quot;
his h@@ ated eyes were directed at me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you m@@ our@@ n unto you what to look in the eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I then did , has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I was in front of this building .
perhaps it was about my tor@@ ness , van@@ ity ; maybe in the revolution .
I was so sure I said , &quot; I would not have imag@@ ined that you have forgotten my voice again for yesterday .
and I think I have never ceas@@ ed to look in the eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
it was the short@@ est entertainment , such fat@@ al consequences for me could have , and yet I regret not a word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lies in individual and his father with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father is the same with that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the st@@ ench of this dist@@ ressing of proposition is to me today in the nose .
he was subj@@ ected to a &quot; Syn@@ drome , &quot; a se@@ el@@ ic torture , which I was exposed to the month .
I crossed the farm .
in the first office I let everything I return with me .
then again through the farm and into the second office that leads through a gear to the individual cells .
I agree with all the details exactly before I step down the room .
otherwise than usual , it was probably a bigger cell to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to split it to me with just one single further prisoners and must immediately sit immediately without waiting for their permission . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes , who felt like a whole life , the officials left the cell , and I hold on an old @-@ established communication method : to hit the wall with the f@@ ist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my cell @-@ fin was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he finally answered me .
apparently no one of the surrounding cells was a resp@@ ectable man middle age that looks similar to me and called the doctor . &quot;
in perfect darkness cannot be recognized to me with no mark@@ ers , and doctors are not there ; we are all only numbers .
&quot; maybe someone , whose voice sounds like my sounds ? &quot;
all answers is linked to its existence .
perhaps he was placed in one of the big cells .
perhaps he will hear immediately .
the investig@@ ator had in@@ sured me , she would leave him if I stay .
Lu@@ gg@@ ers .
I &apos;d like to have a scar@@ ec@@ row to exp@@ el all these cro@@ ws that lab@@ elled against the fruits in the garden of my head .
from far I hear them still &quot; All &apos;@@ ahu ac@@ bar . &quot;
it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time , the hor@@ rors , each day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black was the color of the ruin until I saw the yellow light that gave us the Gre@@ ys in person : the Ra@@ ad ( e.g. : &apos; Don@@ ner , &quot; An@@ spiel@@ ung on 13 S@@ ure des Kor@@ an ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are here to listen to &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so that the secret was pra@@ ised : to protect the state security from us and preventing the terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dial@@ ect - so they played their den@@ omin@@ ational pres@@ tige , and ri@@ v@@ ented the close view of their world view .
this is not a house that is here is not a country ; it is a cur@@ se that call it co@@ existence to turn the crimin@@ als of their sound into a hero .
I super@@ vised the hearing and re@@ efs to Abu I@@ mad , a slim and Flemish man ; at least he comes to me so .
he starts a &quot; enjoyable &quot; conversation , despite the facial expres@@ sions : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start as much more important with your life than closing this day@@ light and to protest to demonstrations in order to be found soon . &quot;
I did not answer .
I used to acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to it , not to answer .
I can really no longer tell them when ins@@ ults and locks after a friendly conversation become an ordinary communication means .
when and how that happened was un@@ important .
any voice in me said that I had to get used me at ease or too , to be pun@@ ished , although I had nothing done to make this punishment .
in punishment in all their variety .
his command is to let me rip as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls the lov@@ ingly &quot; Gest@@ än@@ d@@ nis . &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube , which probably comes from the hooks .
your execu@@ tioner is interested in your cry .
give him the pleasure , you cannot measure you with him and you cannot with@@ hold your fri@@ ght .
my fear fell not yet enough , why she inter@@ change@@ able the pipe by a cable .
in my first lap I asked myself whether the investig@@ ator had worked as a gar@@ bage dump , or if that belonged to the normal working environment .
they had four cables on each other to present us the idea of their view , great in@@ vention of a huge cable .
within a single hour , three of them abo@@ unded , while I was still on the line .
I had any feeling lost in my body - and also my voice , which is why I list@@ ened to cry .
the Hen@@ ker re@@ marked the cooling , and found no vessel in it , which is why it was considered next to an electri@@ cally charged .
river flow@@ ed my whole body , enough to provide my entire neighborhood .
my semi @-@ snack body , the stretched on the ground , was the perfect conductor .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
this must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again again ; say we sometimes that was my only option .
some hours left that I got as minutes before .
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and fills the space &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ar@@ sch@@ fic@@ ker &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I answered with the voice of an exhaus@@ tible young : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my Father must be trou@@ bled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be silent and Be@@ away you , you will be moved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was new .
otherwise they had always released .
where do they run me ? !
the J@@ ord@@ ina Rap@@ per Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b talk about the rights of LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and opposition
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b smo@@ kes a cigar@@ ette in his studio .
the photo was recorded by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b for@@ gets the majority of his time dr@@ in@@ doors ; sometimes he s@@ our@@ ced to his canvas , sometimes to his computer , and again to his couch .
but what can be abandoned , is a cigar@@ ette between its fingers or its pl@@ ot@@ ene hidden lips .
he lives in the top floor of his family house , which had been in front of them since 1967 ; the year , in which Israel completed his occupation of the West@@ bank , and H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs family forced to fle@@ e from their village in Palestine in which she had lived as fel@@ ah@@ y@@ een ( about : Far@@ mer ) .
for six years H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is a passionate activ@@ ist who stands on the conserv@@ ative majority and ques@@ tioned its old opinions about gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and Rap@@ music .
with his music , often faced with topics like ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , but also calls for the core of the whole Arab world . all these topics do not only find in his native city of Am@@ man Rel@@ ev@@ ance but also in cities that suff@@ ice from Damascus in Syria to San@@ aa in Y@@ emen .
with its 25 years H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees itself as someone who is not restricted in his mind by limits and he can feel according to their own statement with the people who have suffered among the devast@@ ating consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq , Y@@ emen , Syria and Libya .
even if he does not open it openly , he defe@@ ated a special di@@ version against American foreign policy .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b regards his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b does not believe his compassion for those who try to survive in war @-@ areas , something that is to do with his identity as &quot; Palestinian refugees &quot; - so he is born himself , even though he was born in Jordan , and has never been in Palestine until now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think because of my own living conditions so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; st@@ resses H@@ d@@ ai@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then it adds : &quot; I think that because I am a man , &quot; while in water I am burnt down to two cups . it is the Holy month of Ram@@ adan ; at that time it is intended for Muslims , from sunrise to sunset .
the j@@ ord@@ al law also declares that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
obviously , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee on a sens@@ ed hot Jun@@ it@@ ag has little to do with protest against Islam .
generally speaking the mess@@ enger of hot coffee and the fac@@ ades of the c@@ ent cigar@@ ette in the nose is first and foremost by freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky , especially when you have a look into the neighbouring countries .
it therefore makes it easy to do basic things - as to drink basic things - as to drink in public during Ram@@ adan water - to land not in prison .
recently , the Republic of Jordan has had a performance of the band M@@ ash@@ rou &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a , already for the second time .
some of the parliament , supporting the Islam@@ ic action of the Muslim Bro@@ therhood - argu@@ ed that the sexual orientation of hom@@ os@@ ex@@ ual fron@@ ts@@ ant Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o , reflect the cultural and traditional norms of the country and be the main reason for the concert tab@@ s .
the members and former press spok@@ es@@ person of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that had said the concert &quot; just &quot; because of the sexual orientation of the S@@ ang@@ ers .
many pret@@ ations that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world may be dangerous activ@@ ism that constitutes the old legi@@ timacy of author@@ it@@ arian regimes in the entire region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ rou &apos;s M@@ ash@@ rou &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; progressive supporters of human rights &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which continue to use itself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for intellectual and cultural plur@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this statement is likely to be simply not simply the r@@ het@@ or@@ ic r@@ het@@ or@@ ic but actually reflects an increasingly clear reality in Jordan that occurs in H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs work clearly .
in the year 2016 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b traditional sex @-@ like to Lei@@ be , having formed his vision of the fate of Arab women who have vo@@ re@@ hel@@ i@@ chen to have sex .
the picture shows the sk@@ elet@@ on of a apparently endangered @-@ known woman whose arms and legs are standing up to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red sea ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who actually should trust them .
in the past years , the number of &quot; Hon@@ orary Se@@ de &quot; has increased in Jordan - the in@@ official outside .
human Rights Watch according to the amount of Hon@@ orary Citi@@ zens in 2016 got their cul@@ min@@ ation ; however , the Jordan had missing the institutional infrastructure to support women who have been victims of murder or domestic violence to support proper way .
according to a law on breaking control from 1954 , women who are exposed to danger in prison , &quot; to un@@ certain time in prison , &quot; and for its release is often a long @-@ bureaucr@@ atic burden as well as the guarantee by the family is needed that the woman is nothing to happen .
also H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs music has enjoyed great pop@@ ularity and is known for it , also not before heading to scru@@ ffy , which is in his country long as tab@@ u g@@ old .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b argu@@ ed that his work is political , however , that he is his music , who is full of exp@@ on@@ otes on sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression is not able to separate from politics .
&quot; I kom@@ m from the N@@ ear , man .
I became a policy of politics , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a song called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the question of the Palestinian identity in attack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in &quot; Lav@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; the focus is on poverty .
the list of songs which are political , can be recorded in the core .
in March 2016 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b published a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated many times :
&quot; you are free , and any other one is also . &quot;
in the further course of the song H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a kind of market on which one can get in his words , &quot; that can be &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ faith , H@@ et@@ ero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality .
he notices that barely any one speaks in Jordan on the rights of g@@ ay and les@@ bi@@ ans and that comments on equality of LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals were largely cen@@ sored in 2014 .
2014 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b led an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ an@@ ic online program Ro@@ ya , in order to remember that his comments were in@@ dem@@ ol@@ ished from the context , and his opinion were cen@@ sored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Youtube , it has been up@@ loaded without cuts , but only one edited version &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is open to the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that intoler@@ ance towards homosexu@@ als do not speak to Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ what , a po@@ et of the eighth century , who has remained in memory today thanks to its hom@@ o@@ erotic poems .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks itself : if Abu Nu@@ anything that should work later on behalf of the pot@@ assium , in the eighth century I could write openly about homosexu@@ ality , why can Jordan do this ?
the real problem , so h@@ d@@ ai@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ rou &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the H@@ asch@@ ary Kingdom there is nothing new that the government attacks attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are brought about silence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian message service picked up several former government members and members of the teacher , with the ration@@ ale , they had expressed themselves on comments in social media critical about the problems caused by deep in the country @-@ ro@@ oting corruption .
in view of what is the concert of H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs , according to that , only the tip of the ic@@ eberg - the real challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jordan river .
for him progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan has denied M@@ ash@@ rou &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - so sieht es H@@ d@@ ai@@ b - consists of slow , op@@ pressor and inner changes . it is certain that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the ordinary society .
last@@ ly , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , though , as millions of other Arabs , also , of an Arab world without interventions in foreign countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he not only dream@@ y his work as to B@@ agh@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to experience &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the region is through music , art and literature of genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bom@@ bs , Stre@@ um@@ uni@@ tions and on artificial kinds of law@@ ful democr@@ acies . at least he hopes that .
until that time , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b will continue to pass , and therefore shall also provide resistance .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan .
these large , ex@@ trav@@ ag@@ ant war lips are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Neb@@ uta festival .
one susp@@ ected that it is a variant of Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually practic@@ ed in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory came over that the f@@ esti@@ vities and dancing over more than one thousand years have been delivered in the northeast to force the Indi@@ genous inhabitants of the region , the Em@@ ishi , to force the knee .
we are at the Neb@@ uta festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to sn@@ ap a few great seats , so we have a great view .
you can only imagine how large these parts are ...
a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , hosted a two @-@ month exhibition to W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally .
I look at the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en again for a long time : two sol@@ ves are straight to be seen .
nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta festival is the only truth - and a breathtaking way to spend their summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Sommer@@ festival in the north of the country .
I was here and looked at the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 meter high sea car was incredible .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !

rarely , external appearance and body care is as important as in this story , because they help us to maintain the Peru@@ vian youth from crime and to promote a legi@@ timate occupation just like the hair@@ dres@@ ser .
El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us the most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate where road ro@@ b and illegal drug trading are everyday .
in April 2017 , a survey revealed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region would not feel safe .
at the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , the appearance , appearance and thus also the f@@ ancy hair@@ styles of famous sport@@ s@@ men like Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led to getting more of norm@@ ality in the experienced hands of hair@@ dressers that can re@@ produce these consuming hair@@ styles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the un@@ preced@@ ented demand for hair@@ styles that go to the extreme borders of fantasy and creativity , even has an annual event , the competition of the hair@@ dressers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which has been held since 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are experts to counter each other to show who can create the ex@@ centr@@ ist L@@ ooks book@@ shop as you can see in the following video ( more videos to current competitions there are on the public Facebook @-@ profile batt@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
education institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , which is located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to convince young people of it to get their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and instead of poor advice on training in the hair@@ dressing art that allows them to find work .
motiv@@ ates this activity and the possibilities to offer do@@ zens of young people that they can take a job , which is currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops in March and reported on some of their successes :
in 1995 we were the only specialist school in the municipality and the district , which we are very proud of because from love to children we have established this educational community .
Columbia : love letter to Gu@@ err@@ illa

use with kind permission .
the following article is the edited version of the article &apos;s &quot; Lov@@ ing Sho@@ es &quot; that released the international online @-@ Magazin Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
the article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write only love letters to people who we know ?
is it not yet much more important , people who feel prepared to accommodate affection ?
exactly this question went to the two young Colom@@ bian activi@@ sts by the Stiftung Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young @-@ Youth @-@ Stiftung no longer out of the head and inspired it to the campaign Cart@@ as por la R@@ econ@@ ci@@ li@@ ación ( letters to reconciliation ) , who write young people to write gu@@ err@@ illa letters .
only recently , its country &apos;s location of an historical event and they wanted to contribute their part . after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace agreement with the Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ a@@ Movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary forces of Colombia ) , which forms the final point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
international was considered to sign the sign of peace , so important that the Colom@@ bian President José Manuel San@@ tos was awarded the No@@ bel Peace Prize .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , in front of the Colom@@ bian@@ co , it is still a long way to talk about real reconciliation and peace . &quot; &quot; &quot;
gu@@ err@@ illa fighters that lived for many years in illegal bearings , were exposed to a military r@@ het@@ or@@ ic , and all around the clock have carried out their weapons in their lives , they have to be incorporated into the life as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society in turn , who has acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to life in constant fear and in some cases a deep hat@@ red against Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ak@@ er@@ ern , it must now take in their ranks and assist them in building a new life .
Leonardo and Cr@@ istian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bian people had to join and help in integration process .
and this is exactly what they did : up to now , thousands of young people wrote letters of letters - love @-@ message to former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters to welcome them back in the company .
the aim of the campaign are 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former Gu@@ err@@ illa fighters - who will then be handed over to personally .
Valentine &apos;s as inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the letters to reconciliation was created on the world summit of the No@@ bel Peace Prize which took place in Bog@@ ot@@ á in February 2017 . there were Leonardo and Cr@@ istian the possibility to speak briefly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ th@@ i , which was awarded the No@@ bel Peace Prize .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this explained that we love the people who we love , at Valentine &apos;s thousands of love letters , but those forget that they need much more need . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he tar@@ p@@ au@@ lin , he continued to share his love with people this year that needed most pressing .
thus the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of F@@ ARC , who will now find their place in society and to build up a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian company is ready to make the dis@@ course of a war history to a common history of peace . &quot;
so far in the framework of the campaign were collected more than 2000 letters .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Barran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á .
&apos;@@ i had never imag@@ ined that someone would for@@ give me &apos;
the first 500 letters were passed on 19 March in one of the UN camp in the Cal@@ don@@ o region .
a group of 40 students of the University J@@ aver@@ iana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art bur@@ sts in the camp to transfer the letters personally .
the members of the F@@ ARC presented themselves how they had done it earlier to take the orders of their leaders .
but this time they received no orders , but letters full of under@@ use of people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for all involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings can walk in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that lies between , &quot; told the politicians of Manuela Jim@@ é@@ nez Av@@ ila later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a assistant of the govern@@ ors of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable experience :
after we had handed over the letters , a former figh@@ ter led me through the camp of Gu@@ er@@ illa fighters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( a kind of hut , in which the Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ak@@ sho@@ cks live ) , I saw a Gu@@ err@@ illa fighters that wrote something . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was afraid to go down , because next to him on the bed was a M@@ GL shell L@@ ace , a deadly weapon in the Dorn@@ bir@@ thing sheep .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hello , what do they do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I rep@@ lied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I responded to a letter that someone has written me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
never my life has never written me something so beautiful , that is why I suddenly responded to it . &quot; I suddenly delivered the tears over the che@@ eks .
I embr@@ aced him completely and set me next to the Gran@@ at@@ cher .
perhaps he was tired too , was sorry to be all the years of faithful compan@@ ions of this figh@@ ter and wanted to help him to write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he never had anything else from life than war . he who had to join the F@@ ARC , was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers before the fam@@ ine . &quot; I never thought that someone would for@@ give me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society there waiting for us with open arms .
until now I learned only how to deal with weapons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now where peace re@@ igns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new voices
to the pre@@ lu@@ de , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC came together to a discussion section .
the students were all grown up as already war and conqu@@ ered the F@@ ARC already in the secret .
therefore , the leaders of the F@@ ARC , the history of the organization , its ide@@ als and gave insight into their views about the peace process : &quot; many years have experienced , how we have the possibility to develop ourselves to a political party , we can help to create society in this land .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a target of this size , it is worth to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manuela was impressed with :
these people have never heard heard so far and had no choice , and to realize that people who often saw as mon@@ ster and even hate even people with beautiful feelings are turned by their li@@ vel@@ ings and their environment was very pain@@ ful for me .
the reality in which the country lives , does me sore .
but it comfor@@ ted me that all men - also those who killed and so much damage to us can bring us something and give a smile and a hug .
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
Gust@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , the Commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , he wrote for example Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s , the Arch@@ bishop of the City of Cal@@ i , the following letter :
the Colom@@ bian@@ chi was argu@@ ed that after the dra@@ ins of peace would rule .
but this is not the case .
as long as there are inequality , hunger and lack of education , health and employment possibilities , there will always be people who are ready to access weapons and prot@@ esting their rights . and that is entirely justified ( ... ) .
we of the F@@ ARC now rely on peace , to a policy without weapons .
therefore , we call all def@@ enders of peace - regardless of which race , religion or ideology they belong to conf@@ ession - to rise above all of the states that are dre@@ amed from a country in the war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and bring victims , because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those among us who defend the life as the basis of existence will imp@@ ose many difficulties .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .

hom@@ os@@ ex@@ ual and que@@ er people who live in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are a wide range of haz@@ ards exposed - such as discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mailing .
with fri@@ ght , activi@@ sts have experienced the coverage of the last months about the persecution of the persecution men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat posed such as a D@@ amo@@ kl@@ es@@ cent above the dor@@ fer@@ ous LGB@@ T church , is not only written by night .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny who share some of their experiences with us and talked to us about what has happened in the republic .
the LGB@@ T legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has conqu@@ ered the international head@@ lines after several months , after reports they have been published , which the nar@@ ration , torture and the killing men in the Republic them@@ ed .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Now@@ aya Gas@@ eta ; they thre@@ w a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities , which thre@@ w que@@ er men , and put them in secret pr@@ isons in the gun .
&quot; you have brought a mon@@ ster to the world &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a Trans@@ wife , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there .
even since their childhood she felt that she was a woman in reality .
when they became er@@ ce , you became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for it , why she moved to Moscow .
after having experienced a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens from the genital equ@@ ation of her land@@ lady , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina .
out of fear for her life she moved to the USA .
Sab@@ rina : I was an hon@@ orary hero@@ in with a human rights organization .
one day I told me that someone needed my help .
it was an acqua@@ int@@ ance of D@@ ag@@ est@@ an , a trans@@ wife , which hidden in difficulties .
it had no money , so I took it without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , he made someone by whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it all over the internet , with my telephone number and a picture of mine . he sent them to his Che@@ chen friends , using the following message : &quot; then there is no more men more in Ch@@ echn@@ ya that could remove those shame ? &quot;
after that , the photos of my documents made by the whole W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when I was just doing some shopping @-@ up from the back home of my car , I heard a male tim@@ me : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when I turned myself , I felt something in my body , but I did nothing hurt .
then I heard a sentence but this time on the Che@@ chen : &quot; how long do you still want the family to de@@ fl@@ ush yourself ? &quot;
I knew the person not .
I just know that there was a young man , no 30 years old .
then I lost the consciousness and the wo@@ unded final end in the hospital .
apparently , some women had everything to get and started scre@@ am .
the man had fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned , that I had two stit@@ ches in my right l@@ ungs .
OC Media : in what ambul@@ ance has been laid - in the men or the women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are out@@ dated , there is still my male name dr@@ auf ; but the doctor rose and put me to the women .
I am very grateful for this .
when I read his name for the first time at his brush , I got it to do with the fear ; it was a Muslim , a cold name .
but he turned out to be a good man .
I am grateful to him that he is respect@@ ful of me .
I spent more than one month in the hospital .
last February I got threats .
they called me , wrote me - Related , stran@@ gers , some completely unknown .
this was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighb@@ ors and some distant relatives .
the required to return to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that all that was a lie .
they asked absurd demands : some told me , I am proof of it by going up without the streets of the city , others that I did not change in the official TV in Gros@@ ny and tell that I was not having sex , that everything was only bad , and Photoshop .
I have any body size C - what should I say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this print ?
Sab@@ rina : it is still hard for her .
some older people spoke to me my mother on the street .
they said to her , &quot; You have brought a mon@@ ster to the world that not only has your family , but the entire Republic of hurt .
we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you will have to disappear from here . &quot;
my mother was too much and she placed a stri@@ ck around the neck .
luck@@ ily the neighb@@ ors and delivered them .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved into an apartment and a few hours later under the window a car with broken window plates and a num@@ eric sign with a 95 dr@@ on .
once it happened for the third time , it was clear to me that there was something la@@ zy .
my violations of human rights veri@@ fied the numbers of numbers - it turned out that I was persec@@ uted .
OC Media : how did you fled ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activi@@ sts .
for security reasons I do not want to give their names , but I will say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with her help I left the country , but then something was something unbeliev@@ able .
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
I bought it without registration , without a reference , without everything .
I broke my old SIM card and cast it into the rub@@ b@@ ish .
arrived and check@@ up in the hotel .
the number was registered on a stran@@ ger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
in the moment I wanted to call my mother per W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t think about , you &apos;re in security , just because you have left the country ?
our people already know what hotel you are plug@@ ging . you even know your c@@ imm@@ ac@@ tion@@ aries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; just to prove to you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is number 115 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can you imagine this ? !
this was actually my cell number .
OC Media : are you still in touch with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and sisters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , we are not talking about the genital equ@@ alisation , but this is a tabby theme . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some traditionally k@@ au@@ cas@@ ic elements are still in me .
so much I wish it , this se@@ el@@ ic barrier can I not overcome .
I am always saying that , as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt them .
when we chat with camera , I am indeed trying to watch the person how the person rec@@ alls from her past - thus in my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what are your friends , those who have stayed here ?
Sab@@ rina : I have received a report in Washington last week .
for the term I needed up to date information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I spoke to someone who has received a half months in ar@@ gun .
he told that during Ram@@ adan no people were arrested and tor@@ tured but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he did not lock a new wave .
most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I mean , they probably invite relatives to take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experienced through blood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : are now being arrested even more v@@ ast@@ ed men in this sec@@ rec@@ y ?
Sab@@ rina : a well known picture of mine says , there would be just not so many .
if , then especially those who have no abundant relatives or were left by their relatives to make Kad@@ y@@ rows Court .
as far as I know , they are held there so that they can present them later as terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should they be re@@ done , you will show their body on TV and claim they could have attacked either a village or a military base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
as if these people were not simply gone , but specifically sub@@ mer@@ ged to radi@@ al themselves .
OC Media : is this now only a mut@@ ation or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just got someone who had a half months in ar@@ gun .
he says that many people have disappeared in the prison after their be@@ ard grew .
there has been nothing new since them .
they just have taken them away .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was himself taken when these people were taken .
until now , they were not presented as band@@ its , so far there were no reports . we suppose that such actions are quite possible .
why else could you not have this man to shave ?
do you know if these pers@@ ecu@@ tions and de@@ ductions of people , which belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation , already in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always had my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think , before 2003 I was already familiar to Gros@@ ny when I lived there - and I never had problems .
in the Ernst !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sch@@ aria was considered , I had never had problems .
on the contrary , at that time it was much safer than now .
Russia originally intended to bring us back to the &quot; civil@@ isation &quot; but ultimately brought us back to the bri@@ one@@ age .
OC Media : how is this possible under the sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were conf@@ lic@@ ted ; I had fil@@ tered eyelashes , contributed Rö@@ hr@@ je@@ ans and short T@@ ops .
the security ministry of the sh@@ aria has never viol@@ ated me only a hair .
in front of the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially at weekends , a whole group of people met like me .
it was a small square where several ben@@ ches were standing , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why people met young people , there .
we have never been off@@ ended .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a rever@@ ence : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that means : &quot; Sp@@ otte is not about the un@@ happiness of another . &quot;
you often say it to children when those who make themselves funny .
OC Media : so they simply have their eyes locked in front of you because they believed , you are sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never off@@ ended me , never hun@@ ted and never sm@@ itten .
OC Media : how long was this Gn@@ ome time ?
Sab@@ rina : so long to Kad@@ y@@ row on the plan .
when he was appointed Minister of Prime Minister , he began to speak on TV on mor@@ ality .
he did not speak about us per se , but primarily on the behavior of women .
nevertheless - one could feel like the people in the city started to change .
wh@@ o@@ ever had s@@ caff@@ old and laugh@@ ed , see you at once with sus@@ pic@@ ion .
in the period I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home , I could feel how the situation in the Republic has ever been wast@@ ed .
OC Media : what activity do you proceed now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t comp@@ ose much - 700 to 800 dollar per month are not much in the USA .
apart from that I am still working as an activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of Psych@@ ologist .
we organize te@@ ac@@ re@@ ffs , assem@@ ble , I assist you to hospital and help them to get Essen@@ ces .
I have no p@@ enny for this .
I discovered these people myself than I disp@@ ose of flu@@ ent .
I am Muslims and I want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you enter a Hid@@ den@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : this is al@@ bern .
so nature is pure ; it has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Ch@@ echn@@ ya , who want to do with bow@@ ls in front of the mouth , that there is no co@@ ils with them .
the D@@ ag@@ est@@ ans have who , the cab@@ ar@@ din@@ er , who have the Russians also ; on the entire planet there are - but not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I am from there , so it is anno@@ ying to hear sow@@ as .
I meet here so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practic@@ ing Muslims who go into the mosque and during the Ram@@ adan - live with men together .
know , many think of transition to men who love men and they believe that you &apos;re thinking to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a trust .
these are two different things - two different types of sensation to be accurate , different ways of life .
for me it is the most important to feel me in my own skin and not ash@@ amed for my body .
not , if I have a partner or not .
sorry that I will be so personally here , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I am not sad for this - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups war@@ n against an increase in self @-@ murder within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Iranian Ah@@ med @-@ region is suffering from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the past few months there has been a sharp rise in self @-@ murder .
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August , the des@@ per@@ ate situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran , which is shaped by poverty and unemployment , into the lim@@ el@@ ight .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he dwelt in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the southwest of Iran .
he l@@ otion under anxiety , depression , and he ash@@ amed for his own hel@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , the in@@ ability for his family to come up , so Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i human rights groups , who work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and want to remain anonymous .
one on YouTube tested video kept the moments after he had fi@@ red himself .
some people quickly created the fl@@ ames again , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ eg@@ h@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the bur@@ ns were so strong that doctors could do nothing more .
he died a short time later .
it was not the only su@@ icide that has occurred in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i minority , and activi@@ sts on site war@@ n of that , that even more men could take life .
the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Centre for Human Rights is that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sh@@ ah@@ ab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - erh@@ aps .
their stories have one thing in common : there were all family members who were united in the persecution of Iranian government , hel@@ pl@@ ess and capable to feed their families and to pursue a safe work .
Arabic Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , in which a large part of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community is located , was sh@@ aken by a far @-@ reaching economic crisis , which makes it difficult to ride their li@@ vel@@ ih@@ ood in the native Arab population .
a century ago the Arabic Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predomin@@ antly autonom@@ ous region in Iran until the P@@ ahl@@ avi Mon@@ archy took over power and 1925 greatly efforts to put ethnic autonomy in Iran .
in the Ah@@ med Region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields , as well as some of the most valuable and valuable land areas for the Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources the regional economy continued to develop slowly , and the domestic people gets a little bit of this wealth .
it is often victims of untreated diseases , hunger and de@@ grad@@ ation .
the Iranian regime is denied the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Arab@@ ians systematically jobs in local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government also built a variety of di@@ ties , built by the waters of the Arab areas in the Persian territories , where the provinces Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and Gh@@ om .
these d@@ ams have only led to wor@@ sen the devast@@ ation caused in the region by drying in@@ dig@@ nation , and to destroy local agriculture as well as fishing and pal@@ ms industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ ha@@ w@@ zi youth rose to 81 % .
NO@@ UR Moh@@ amm@@ ed P@@ ur , the Iranian General Director of Cooperation , Labour and Social Wel@@ fare , announces that 5 % of the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is , who completed a job , completed 55 % a secondary school and 45 % a university degree .
a &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance . &quot;
Kar@@ im Doh@@ im@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i human rights activ@@ ist with resident in London , told Global Vo@@ ices , that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist discrimination , &quot; to a &quot; high increase &quot; of the number of self @-@ murder among the young Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i men .
Doh@@ im@@ i said that most unemployment has become worse . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ah@@ med &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the Sett@@ ing process : &quot; &quot; &quot;
since function@@ aries and institutions did not fav@@ ors Arab labor force , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i will ent@@ ail access to labour opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs , and to force them to earn their lives outside their own home .
there are people who had to change their preferences and sur@@ name in order to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i , as even Arabian names in the workplace are not toler@@ ated , because the speaking of the Arabic language or the Arabic clothing .
given the given circumstances , which have to bear the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i , the human rights activ@@ ist alarm , before the situation is explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world rise up and take note of it .
the main reason for su@@ icide is un@@ occupied depression .
depression is treat@@ able and su@@ icide is avo@@ idable .

&quot; why I do not identify with femin@@ ism also with the inter@@ fac@@ tional state &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
detail of a photo . recorded by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . published under the CC@@ 0 Creative Commons license .
the following article is an updated version of the opinion written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the website Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as . the article was the subject of several discussions where many different positions have expressed .
you can read in the comments under the original text .
if I say that I am not femin@@ ist , many women - especially white females , who call themselves as an inter@@ c@@ tional fem@@ ini@@ sts - with fru@@ stration .
you wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even thought well , scientific and soci@@ etal arguments before me , why I should be femin@@ ist and why we should be all femin@@ ist * inside .
for example , women today still earn less money despite the same formation as men .
that women are still under str@@ ingent observation , when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their body .
that violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social standards still ensure that women sooner or later meet in different areas of life on a glass ceiling , and that discrimination based on the sex is still moving across the many different countries and fai@@ ths .
all this is aware and known to me .
I am convinced of it and I lei@@ gh double and triple .
I am a black woman .
and yet , when I come to speak on skin colour , on black women in LGB@@ T people , on black women in LGB@@ T church or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; when I speak , on which way we are challenged , both in and outside of femin@@ ist movement , to mention many white fem@@ ini@@ sts and white inter@@ me@@ ager fem@@ ini@@ sts .
but nevertheless all women are saying that women - all women - to come together to &quot; their voices , and &apos; K@@ umb@@ aya , my master &apos; to sing &apos; to achieve equality ( some ) of women .
but they do not want to talk about that , in addition to sexu@@ alised violence prov@@ oked a institu@@ tion@@ alized form of r@@ acial violence , that we are exposed to black women on two @-@ fold species .
or about that black women and women of other ethnic and origin of origin less than white men and women .
that black girl and girls were referred to as a migration background of the school as a white girl , due to apparent integration problems .
or that women in black spheres of women and women are exposed to a higher risk to suffer the domestic violence and violence in partnership , as white women .
on the one hand , I want all the women , all the men and all humans have no skin colour in all the same rights ; on the other hand , I can not observe myself as a black woman , in whose center the white woman is to consider , in@@ justice into their mind that relate to the gender as well as to the skin @-@ color of a person .
I &apos;m exhausted and will no longer fight for my belonging in a white @-@ femin@@ ist co@@ f@@ ist , which still rejected me and countless other black women and always rejected .
So@@ jour@@ ner were compl@@ ained in 18@@ 51 in her speech : &quot; I am not a woman ? &quot; and also I refuse to uph@@ old an ideology , in which the black woman in historic respects is a human and margin@@ alised being .
I refuse to conclude myself form@@ ations , which also ab@@ sorb through cultural appropri@@ ation our customs and customs that ab@@ sorb her eg@@ oc@@ entri@@ c program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will no longer try to put the importance of the importance of skin color and sex ; for some of them will continue to be the importance of black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women attempt to honor them in the better . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the inter@@ we@@ eth@@ eric femin@@ ism was founded to give women from different grounds and to leave themselves from the white fem@@ ism , is still the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I pul@@ ling it off to release me full and completely from femin@@ ism that was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman , instead of working for a white @-@ femin@@ ist para@@ dig@@ m , which is so stu@@ b@@ born that Inter@@ fac@@ tional is celebrated as a new phenomenon .
now it &apos;s more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and set ourselves into the spheres of spheres , which are created by us for us .
Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book A@@ FRI@@ C@@ ANA wom@@ an@@ ism : rec@@ la@@ im@@ ing . ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : how we can defend ourselves , in which they are totally secure and in which the cultural , spiritual , se@@ el@@ ic , bodi@@ ly , and even the spiritual elements can be re@@ vered all the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ fac@@ tional fem@@ ini@@ sts are immediately called separ@@ atism and exclusion after they have read these lines , please get to inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of femin@@ ist movement from which the black woman is concerned .
in a wom@@ an@@ ist environment , I can up@@ lift black women and women of other cultures , for in this para@@ dig@@ m exist .
I will be recognized for my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman as part of this para@@ dig@@ m .
I , a black woman , can blo@@ om in an environment where my life is neither betra@@ yed , nor ignored , nor ignored .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was a kid , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists from all over the country fear@@ ed that the decades of war , the construction of reser@@ d@@ ges , the pollution and the un@@ controlled development , lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Iraq - an subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance - committed and working to protect rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summar@@ izes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a matter : &quot; if we had no water more , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was produced for En@@ sia by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , one in Er@@ bil , in Iraq , in Iraq , and multi@@ medi@@ al journalist , produced , fil@@ med and published .

Paraguay &apos;s Women and her difficult fight against violence
a group women poses &quot; The cr@@ ying women &quot; in order to express their pain on the women &apos;s murder in the country and in the region and to show their rejection .

the following article is the short@@ ened and processed version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; by Kur@@ tur@@ al . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ jer ( # wei@@ ght@@ fully ) that reported on the tissues against women in Paraguay .
most names were changed for the protection of the affected persons .
a police officer said Ada B@@ á@@ ez , that they had nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , their partner who has been working towards violent .
since the end of their relationship has passed some time and the police said , her statement would be put to the acts , but more could not do .
as another woman Bal@@ bu@@ ena because of abuse , also the accumul@@ ated display of Ada B@@ á@@ ez nothing .
some days later the second woman moved their display .
to break the women &apos;s fel@@ lowship of violence against women is difficult .
if women stay at all once , they generally do not receive support from the state .
in many cases the women are also dependent on the men who are mis@@ understand@@ ings . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who ad@@ mit to be victims of violence to report to the prosec@@ ution authorities at all .
content 1 Schl@@ ä@@ ge and Statisti@@ cal 2 Inv@@ isible Mis@@ sions and a legal system , which is nothing under@@ imm@@ ed@@ 3 Paragu@@ ays La@@ ws : good approach , defici@@ ent conversion and statistics
it is hard to determine how many women truly mis@@ led , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , resear@@ cher on the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ studios , a social scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various information and reports , which however do not even educate the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
however , the numbers available are al@@ ar@@ ming .
in 2015 the District Apostle Meeting of 9@@ 600 ads went on for domestic violence . at 70 % of them it was about violence against women .
86 % of the ads in the police came from women .
there were more than 5000 advertis@@ ements on domestic violence at the food courts . there were also 86 % of the ads of women .
in the ads they said 40 % of women that they were physically walking , 55 % of women were talking about psych@@ ic abuse .
but these statistics show not the true scale of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the par@@ agu@@ an Women &apos;s Minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only a few of these criminal off@@ ences are actually shown . &quot; on every woman who re@@ im@@ bur@@ sed in Paraguay because of psych@@ ic abuse , 9 women who do not do this .
on every woman who re@@ im@@ bur@@ sed because of physical Mis@@ sions , two women , who do not do this , &quot; explained it at the end of 2014 .
since women &apos;s su@@ icide in Paraguay has no own off@@ ence existed , the prosec@@ ution authorities may not adequ@@ ately documented how many women are mur@@ dered by their current or former partners each year .
in August 2016 , journalists told at least 12 cases of women &apos;s murder in the country alone until August 2016 .
the coordin@@ ator of human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were mur@@ dered by their current or former partners .
after their estimates he dies in Paraguay every ten days a woman due to violence through men .

invisible mis@@ understand@@ ings and a legal system , which is nothing to undertake
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z has been the firm girlfriend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that they told him the names of all their former friends .
at the beginning it did not want to actually , but gave them to . this should be for ever ber@@ eu@@ en .
today Mari@@ ana 28 years old and no longer coinci@@ ded with Carlos . but two years , she bore the psychological violence in turn - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time recogni@@ z@@ able the most severe recogni@@ z@@ able :
I never thought that I would have been victims of abuse .
if I have read earlier than that , I always thought that only women are going to be ob@@ s@@ worthy , because they decei@@ ve themselves from violent men .
I was convinced that I would never happen .
Mari@@ ana uses social media to report about the abuse through Carlos Vera .
without name , she wrote posts on Facebook where she described its ins@@ ults and various attacks during their two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated it .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked r@@ het@@ or@@ ic whether he ever asked the hand against them and to stand up that his behaviour also was a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana , why she had fallen in so long from Carlos and had not left him before .
it seemed almost as wanted to say that victims of abuse at least a certain co @-@ blame .
Victoria San@@ tos that did not origin@@ ate from Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner she sl@@ apped her .
Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te cre@@ o ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) that consist of women who are all in some way victims of abuse .
in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
you do so many others do not : you take the information of women seriously .
in Victori@@ as Fall everything began with psych@@ ic distr@@ action .
her we@@ al@@ thy partner finally managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he started to strike it .
Victori@@ as ads with the authorities continued without a result and also of their relatives , she received no support .
she introduced a process against her former partners who developed into an unbe@@ atable legal struggle between Paraguay and their home country in which it was mainly about money , power and influence of their former partner .
Paraguay &apos;s laws : good approach , defici@@ ent implementation
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good but not to be applied .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ad of abuse is a path full of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ciary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN @-@ Organization for Women in Paraguay , looks also great problems in applying the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a bill was discussed in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Parliament under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ El@@ las ( # Für@@ sten@@ ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ im@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # non @-@ Less ) are part of a campaign on Twitter , which is supported by Am@@ nest@@ y International .
the original acc@@ us@@ ation of the law fores@@ ees , Fem@@ ici@@ d has to be able to explain and tough@@ er on his own off@@ ence and harder to pun@@ ish as it is already in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia .
thus the legisl@@ ator has changed in some points to also win members of the law they fear@@ ed that this is the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions , which are currently prohibited in Paraguay and can be pun@@ ished with up to five years in prison .
the original bill was envis@@ aged by the bulk of the ( bureaucr@@ atic and economical ) of process that have to bear the victims of violence at present themselves , if they just have to refund a secure place to er@@ ect the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the law@@ makers do not provide sufficient funds for it :
in Paraguay , abuse is seen as part of inter@@ personal relations .
here a change must take place so violence is no longer considered a norm@@ ality .
wh@@ o@@ ever conf@@ lic@@ ated in view of these facts makes himself no@@ cent and contributes to the perpet@@ rat@@ ors of the perpet@@ rat@@ ors .
we have to refund such a long display until abuse is no longer considered normal .
on 10 November 2016 , the Act in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Senate . previously , parts of the law had been altered though , among other things , a passage under@@ lined that the partners in cases of domestic violence called for reconciliation .
the opinions about the changes are to be taken apart .
the section on reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity for the ag@@ g@@ ress@@ or to attack his sacrifice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the statement of words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gender &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of parts of the law shall apply however as a great return . &quot; &quot; &quot;

independent media in O@@ man continues to ban a year after the ban of a newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this site was blocked because of a decision of the ministry of information , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is locked on the homepage of the Forbidden newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than one year ago the om@@ an@@ ic authorities have closed the independent Arab @-@ speaking newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of their reporting on corruption in sult@@ an .
You@@ sef Al @-@ ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues in prison , where he can ban@@ ded a one @-@ year sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and made in court , but later came again .
O@@ man is ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ b@@ n S@@ aid , who came to power after having his father , S@@ aid i@@ b@@ n T@@ aim@@ ur , holding a state of state .
since then he disgu@@ ised , in addition to his role as the only Sultan , the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Minister of Finance , Minister of Finance , Minister of Foreign Minister , Minister of Foreign Minister , Minister of Foreign Minister , President of the Supreme Council for planning and President of the Central Bank .
the reign of Sult@@ ans is characterized by the prec@@ arious efforts of the security forces , in particular the domestic Intelligence , including press freedom , restrict and protect human rights defence , independent journalists , blo@@ gg@@ ers and other activi@@ sts , to in@@ timi@@ date and de@@ tained other activi@@ sts .
the authorities limit peaceful and legi@@ timate activities in the field of human rights systematically and hin@@ der citizens , also activi@@ sts , to express their views on public affairs of the country such as corruption in authorities and institutions , both online and offline .
the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure , and the de@@ tention of three of their editors in the last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper , which has been reported on corruption in O@@ man ( an absolute mon@@ archy ) until it was prohibited by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , which was published in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 , after the title &quot; high @-@ ranking parties &quot; was published in the judi@@ ciary . it was about corruption in the judi@@ ciary and the intervention of high @-@ level officials in judicial choices .
in the report , government officials acc@@ used to raise the judge of the Supreme Court of O@@ man under pressure to raise a judgment in a inheritance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n of 26 July 2016 with a report on the title page with the heading : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ level parties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hands of the judi@@ ciary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on 3 August 2016 , he has been invited Al @-@ Abr@@ i , member of the Board of Directors , invited by the ISS before the special department and was arrested in his arrival by the security forces .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS awarded the dep@@ uty @-@ in @-@ chief You@@ sef Al @-@ ha@@ j , who had appeared in Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is commemor@@ ating as editor @-@ in @-@ chief .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the paper was closed at un@@ certain times , after the information given the statement given that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper in any way , including online , from 9 August 2016 forbidden . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the first trial in Mas@@ kat was held in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i .
the Court condem@@ ned the three journalists to pr@@ isons and ass@@ ump@@ ed the final closure of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ ha@@ j were both condem@@ ned among other things because of a distur@@ b@@ ance of the public order , &quot; mis@@ use of the internet &quot; and &quot; subordin@@ ation of the pres@@ tige of the state . &quot;
al @-@ ha@@ j was furthermore inv@@ ented the violation of an audience and the s@@ lan@@ der for guilty .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ ha@@ j were sentenced to three @-@ year adhesi@@ on and money stra@@ igh@@ s in the amount of 3000 om@@ ani ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . moreover , a one @-@ year occupational ban against the two journalists was imposed .
al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to one year in prison and a fine death penalty in the amount of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 2600 US dollars ) after using &quot; an information network for spreading material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
for Al @-@ Abr@@ i a refundable bond was arrested in the amount of 5000 om@@ ic Ri@@ al ( 13 000 US dollars ) and was released on 22 August 2016 before the judgment .
the Court of Ap@@ pe@@ al spoke Al @-@ Abr@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , condem@@ ned al @-@ ha@@ j to a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari to six months of prison .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after the sentence of his six @-@ month imprisonment sentence in Mas@@ kat . al @-@ ha@@ j continues to be in prison , where he hi@@ des his old prison .
the Court of Ap@@ pe@@ als also lifted up the decision of the ministry of information to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
despite the decision of judgment , Az@@ am@@ n , the newspaper still sees itself ahead of attack by the government of attack .
on January 8 , the information call was given a statement with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the information given by &apos; Az@@ am@@ n &apos; was personally extended to a further statement in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and has led the minister again to equi@@ p the paper .
the continual closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which the freedom of the press was viol@@ ated .
for further injury , for example , the closing of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first autonom@@ ous online newspaper of the country , its operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the permanent closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the de@@ tention of journalists Al @-@ ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ an@@ ic authorities are still not ready to set up an end to the extensive violation of the freedom of the press . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Gulf of Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the om@@ an@@ ic authorities :
1 . You@@ sef Al @-@ ha@@ j will release immediate and un@@ condi@@ tionally ;
2 . secure a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n so that their journalists can follow their work .
3 . protect the freedom of the press in the country and
4 . in all circumstances ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in O@@ man can imp@@ ose their un@@ law@@ ful sense of human rights and without fear of destruction , including the judicial sh@@ ines , can ex@@ ert .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ ors 2016 in Zambia , picture takes place with his consent
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media or not mentioned at all . this is an increasing area that addresses the most pressing needs of the continent .
for the need to be performed on @-@ site medical research there are two reasons : for a lack of global health , many medicines and vaccines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis and mal@@ aria are far more widespread in the poorest countries in Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investments for exploring these diseases through pharmac@@ euticals are a major problem .
second , research that is carried out by African scientists who develop their own research capacity in Africa . a greater role for science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ ors ist Director of the centr@@ ist at the Center for the research of inf@@ ectious diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR@@ Z ) .
he grew in Lus@@ aka in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , especially when the AIDS epide@@ mic effect showed first serious impact on national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , first at Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indiana .
as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he sear@@ ched for himself on HIV virus , before he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ bian health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. Warri@@ ors discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understanding of the media on these research .
( disclaimer : Dr. Warri@@ or speaks as an individual ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ or RW : at the moment the focus of my work on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ bian national program for Anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
furthermore , I just died a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ ogen@@ s .
GV : what are your opinion of the important current trends in your country and generally in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research . we only implement solutions that have been developed differently .
this must change , otherwise we will always remain recei@@ vers instead of being creators .
the solutions we get , are often not suitable in our surroundings , and sometimes it is impossible to use it here .
GV : where does the finance and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are very well funded .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or want to come here because finance and development opportunities are better in other countries .
GV : how is the research infrastructure ?
which obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not had ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it cost much money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries .
GV : how is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there are already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
GV : how large is your opinion the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they concentrate on and how can we support development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students from all ages .
there is need of special scientific training , starting at any age .
the social sciences , computer sciences , big data , research of the Cos@@ mon@@ ty , the Health Service ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and cont@@ agi@@ ous diseases ) and efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly .
GV : can you describe the pro@@ s and cons of Life as a scientist in Africa towards Western countries , based on your experience ?
RW : often , there are the limited speed , things to do , and the scar@@ ce access to scientific expertise , which represent challenges here .
the system that journals will make available articles only against payment ( the so called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limited the amount of availability and speed of research .
from the US to India : how to change &quot; Open Source &quot; seed producers into global food production
this contribution from Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky originally appeared on the site En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports on solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mort@@ on bre@@ ds already in the USA for the 1980s .
its company offers 114 sorts , such as Out@@ red@@ ge@@ ous , the first plant that is cultivated and consumed by NA@@ SA @-@ A@@ stron@@ aut in space .
for almost 20 years Mort@@ on work was only determined by its own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question how many sal@@ aries could get .
but the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he noted that increasingly more sal@@ ads were pat@@ ented and that he could not use it on the bre@@ eder .
the patents go not only for individual varieties , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green or curved leaves .
in recent years , more and more such patents have been filed on more and more plants like grain or card places . because of these trends , plant bree@@ ders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts provide food security for food security for the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia ancient tradition , Mort@@ on is still salad , however , it does not need any longer , since its work is increasing more and more constraints than ever .
&quot; it is , than would lie in a river a rock , to which I have to p@@ ump@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have to do this now , but it is a fraction of the breeding @-@ tradition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says he . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that these patents go on sal@@ ads . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if they stick to judgment , no one can breed any more of a new sal@@ ary , because all the characteristics are already pat@@ ented . &quot; he is doing so well as possible and tried to cur@@ ate the characteristics he wants .
however , he is very careful and stri@@ ving to use no material which is protected as being intellectual property .
he is also connected to a movement that is becoming ever greater in the US and all over the world : Open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; bre@@ eder ) .
ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts of the International ISS station ISS awarded red red@@ mers@@ al@@ at of the Sor@@ te Out@@ red@@ ge@@ ous in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station bre@@ d and eaten , there will be tested whether plants can be grown in space .

it is no coinci@@ dence that this name sounds rather like it would be the movement from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; Open @-@ Source &quot; -@@ Saat@@ gut ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; Open Source &quot; software that provides alternatives to copyright @-@ protected software .
it was called into being to ensure that some plant species and -@@ gens are not protected as intellectual property and are permanently usable for plant bree@@ ders .
as part of the initiative , named Os@@ si , shortly Os@@ si , he can commit to the bre@@ eder that others may be able to use them freely .
this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and they can sell them . &quot; Open Source &quot; bre@@ eder do not allow others to breed their seed , and it will not immediately exp@@ ose themselves - two aspects that are prohibited by many plant pat@@ ente respectively .
do@@ zens of bre@@ eder and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014 .
s@@ caff@@ old views
Professor of the University of Wis@@ cons@@ in Ma@@ dison and Os@@ si @-@ Management Board Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are monitoring over the seeds and the ability to grow new plants , both important for food security and environmental protection .
seeds also plays a role in larger contex@@ ts such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control over the dietary system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bree@@ ders would try to use the latter or only little by employ@@ ing seeds with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphasises that the &quot; Open @-@ Source &quot; movement did not work with gene@@ tically modified plants .
all kinds of plants could be pat@@ ented whether vegetables , grain , gene@@ tically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; who wants to purchase our goal of ecological sustainability , such as for example on farm markets , should also know that the way for example is bre@@ d on farm markets , should also know that the way this vegetable is bre@@ d is threatened .
nutri@@ tive sovereignty without seeds of seeds is not possible . &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to providing others to the seed they will continue to provide you with action in contrast , to patent seeds and plant @-@ characteristics .

Os@@ si @-@ supporters argu@@ ed that the future of food supplies is at risk , since the available gen@@ oci@@ de due to always numerous acqu@@ itted intellectual property rights on plant material , which is thus always limited to un@@ shr@@ ink@@ able .
Claire Lu@@ by , Executive of the Os@@ si , has been engaged in her PhD with genetic vari@@ ation with car@@ r@@ ots and their availability . it found out that about one third of all Kart@@ ot@@ ten@@ ess is protected as being intellectual property , making it not only usable for plant bre@@ eder .
for other plants there are not such estimates yet , but experts like Lu@@ by susp@@ ect that mass @-@ juice cultivated plants like wheat in even a large style are pat@@ ented as salad or car@@ r@@ ots .
a question of view
plants are so bre@@ d that they are target@@ ing targeted characteristics - from such , through which their tastes or their color can be improved until such , due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments , and threats such as ver@@ min or sick@@ ness or diseases .
opponents of pat@@ ches on plant characteristics point out that the available plant material for bre@@ eder thanks to more and more patents . genetic diversity are currently un@@ necessary than ever since the changing conditions are worse predic@@ table due to climate change .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ Spe@@ cher@@ in Car@@ ly Sc@@ adu@@ to indicate that genetic diversity is generally important and also decisive for Mon@@ san@@ tos activities . with a total of four Gen@@ ths and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture , the Company for the conservation of genetic diversity .
you contradi@@ cts the opinion that intellectual property promote other bree@@ ders , since &quot; patents and the protection of plant vari@@ ability to promote innovation . &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow , once the patent is expi@@ red .
often these instructions help others to get to the same result with another method .
thus , such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovations , but promotes them by making the public more material and know @-@ how . &quot;
Mort@@ on sees the differently : 20 years to wait for a patent expi@@ red , which certainly does not produce innovation .
and if you have been waiting for such a long way to cultiv@@ ate plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , the fight could have lost already .
the main argument to Mort@@ on is , however , that genetic resources have always been a general good and it should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant bree@@ ders have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ ary incentives are not attractive for us .
we want farmers to make their work easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us and it will be impossible if we continue to use the best and newest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; altogether , Mort@@ on is up@@ set on the concept of itself , plant @-@ characteristics : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we create the features not really . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plants form them out and as a bree@@ ders , at least we have no idea how the plants do this .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for Car@@ ol Dep@@ pe , plant breeding @-@ in in the US @-@ state Oregon and Os@@ si @-@ board member , there is still another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; who is bre@@ d a variety , bre@@ d also his own values into them .
wh@@ o@@ ever believes in industrial agriculture with large cour@@ ty@@ ards and mon@@ oc@@ ult@@ es , for their cultivation we need Her@@ bi@@ zi@@ de , bre@@ d in his varieties of this concept of agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is exactly &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that move to international markets but smaller than for example Mon@@ san@@ to are patents , create it the most smaller seed companies , even without patents to survive - either reject it , or keep it for too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both is the case .

Mort@@ on is also the view that bre@@ eder by the A@@ void of plant pat@@ ent@@ ators are innovative : &quot; it looks like I am with my efforts to produce new , stronger than companies , the patent .
I constantly need new material for my catalogue , since I know that my competi@@ tor will sell my sorts in a couple of years , &quot; says he . &quot; with a patent you are protected from competition for 20 years ago , with which you think it is quite simple to make . &quot; worldwide reson@@ ance
although the US seem to be a leader in the &quot; Open Source &quot; c@@ atter@@ ing , the concept is now broad@@ cast@@ ed rapidly all over the world .
in India the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) that works itself as a professional organization in the area of resources , an &quot; Open @-@ Source &quot; seed programme . for the preservation of the seed plant and helps them to grow new varieties that meet specific requirements .
it also supports them to come to &quot; Open Source &quot; seed and to sell their own .
the German organisation Agre@@ co@@ l works on an &quot; Open @-@ Source &quot; license which ultimately requires a formal and legally binding form of the Os@@ si obligation for bre@@ eder in the European Union .
( regulations for the bre@@ eder differ from country to country where the Os@@ si obligation cannot simply be taken into one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , explains that conventional plants should not be pat@@ ented . thus , it speaks against the current practice of the European patent law , which patents on a conventional crops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , a statement is not yet a law ; now it is in the governments of the Member States to achieve this new line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2016 , the Dutch organisation Hi@@ v@@ os organised a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed @-@ related associations and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all East Africa to learn something about the &quot; Open Source &quot; seed @-@ movements and the worldwide trend towards the sponsor@@ ing of seeds .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; programme for &quot; Open Source &quot; -@@ Saat@@ gut systems , that the organization is currently an international alliance for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems for the planned next year the official start show .
a merger of environmental protection and development groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non@@ profit development agency US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database to seeds and biodiversity worldwide to release the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed @-@ map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food - a Verb@@ und consisting of auxiliary organizations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - a report that farmers must have the opportunity to contribute to seeds and to contribute to seed policy so that a stable supply of foods can be assured with food .
in the report , the importance of a diverse , local supply of seeds were stressed with seeds for sustainable food security systems - a connection , from the Lu@@ by of Os@@ si hopes that soon more people will see .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has largely taken place where and how something grown , and seed systems have barely played a role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are trying to make the people clear that even more behind their foods are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organization and blog are the latest objectives of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in Egypt
still , the Egyptian authorities do not still lock the contents on the internet .
this time it hit the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ ni@@ sten .
on the weekend around the 05.@@ aug@@ ust , the Egyptian government has documented the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documented human rights ab@@ uses in Egypt and the Arab world and reported on that .
August published the network a position on fac@@ ebook , in which it has cri@@ tici@@ zed the Egyptian authorities for this step , and spoke to continue the work and efforts of human rights in the region .
the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remain bt@@ - despite this attack and the Constitution of the Egyptian Law and the Constitution . even though it has never been so difficult to pursue these goals , so it was never so important as it now . AN@@ HR@@ I have never been so important to overcome these objectives and not to med@@ itate on . we ins@@ ist to fulfill our task further .
AN@@ HR@@ I is regarded as the first cen@@ sored website of a human rights organization in Egypt , after the authorities &apos; linked more than two months 21 websites , such as e.g. the independent news of MA@@ DA Mas@@ r , arab@@ ic @-@ speaking edition of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , and that from Qatar stam@@ atic network of Al Jaz@@ e@@ era , because of the &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of the wave of web war@@ nings to the victims . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language htt@@ ps : / / t@@ .c@@ o / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , there is also no access to Egypt in the blog of the colum@@ ni@@ sten and Human Rights of Ah@@ med Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada .
Zi@@ ada used his blog for spreading C@@ olumn and articles that he does not offer accessible websites and media for in Egypt .
now the blog , which he con@@ stituted in order to avoid the c@@ ens@@ ur@@ isation of the Egyptian government , even goal of an attack .
blo@@ gger , the provider in the case of Zi@@ adas blog is native , but on the other hand is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in cap@@ tivity , after he was arrested by the Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he picked up a video as the police bodi@@ ly violence against two students .
his article mainly revol@@ ves around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment by the Zi@@ ada to the rejection by the government and reflected what this means :
the fact , blogs to block is very old , however , has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ ta@@ h al @-@ S@@ isi number ; and even if the rejection of the blog may not be significant for the world , so it is for two reasons :
1 ) It succeeded in convey to me the feeling of an ins@@ ult@@ ing state ; An imprisonment , a betra@@ y murder , a reference to the National Security Council , the rejection of blogs as well as any other web page , for which I worked .
2 ) You have proven that I was not in other words : my words have no influence , even if only on a small audience .
I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it to the post of articles to get the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship .
however , after they have blocked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the Mu@@ sty face the way up to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ink and Ex@@ pression ( AF@@ TE ) sp@@ err@@ ated Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06 August 133 websites . this took technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provider ( ISP ) , e.g. Orange , Vod@@ af@@ one and E@@ tis@@ al@@ at .
AF@@ TE also documented the rejection of vend@@ ors , through the conversion of boarding facilities and private surfing possible , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ PN@@ s )
AF@@ TE reported in her research :
on Monday , June 12 noted , how to offer the block@@ age of websites , the v@@ PN@@ s started .
such a practice indicates the intention of the government to continue to block and filter content that might have access to the Egyptian users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the situation will in addition be shi@@ fted that the c@@ ens@@ ur@@ als are made behind closed doors , causing the Egyptian population has no legal basis , with which it can proceed to trial against these actions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and whom will they attack the next attack ?
Rio de Janeiro are war ?

day by day we report newspapers in Brazil with different head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city of the country and home of numerous post@@ cards .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old , shot in school , &quot; The Second Day will be a police officers in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; thi@@ eves , pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , Marine and Lu@@ ba@@ af@@ ee to Rio . &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation the Gew@@ al@@ tw@@ elle 2017 reached the highest level since 10 years .
the Brazilian non @-@ government Global Justice calls even call the United Nations to interv@@ ene .
reports like these are all daily and this is unacceptable and # 8@@ 212 ; at least the manager of a local paper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so published for the detailed coverage of violence in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 16 August the editorial office &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is not normal &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which they announced a new section called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published there .
the motives for their decision explained the newspaper so :
extra will continue to report on crimes that may happen in any major city on the world like murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sex inter@@ ruption , etc . all , however , has happened in the category &quot; War in Rio &quot; ( ... ) this is our way to call : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not closing our eyes from cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four@@ fold video that was shared on Facebook , declared Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the editor of the newspaper , that this decision is no occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure to be :
extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war bri@@ tish in a country that does not recognize the war at all .
in the same video , a journalist of the newspaper , that there are indications of the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro . 8@@ 43 territories which are controlled by criminal organisations .
in the editorial article , writes the paper on :
we are aware that a war dis@@ course , if it is dist@@ orted , also used to be used , atro@@ cities of the police , which only sho@@ ots and then questions arise .
but we defend the war based on information and the struggle against corruption in the police whose objective is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the m@@ af@@ ia and its partners .
do the name &quot; War &quot; more than they benefit ?
in an article on the Message portal The Inter@@ cept Brasil we ar@@ gue the journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oliveira about the violence as a &quot; war . &quot; this is their opinion a justi@@ fication of the failed security policy through the media and could make it complain if the police force .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as it has shown in the analysis of military deploy@@ ments in Rio themselves - in combination with in@@ sufficient investment in personnel , education and a historical and self @-@ suffici@@ ency of public service .
to remember : the federal state Rio de Janeiro is more than just its capital .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Rio de Janeiro than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violent settlement in Brazil &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; according to Cec@@ í@@ lia is false : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 22 of the 30 violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the north and north @-@ east of the country . these are the latest data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
if we look at the Mor@@ dr@@ ade per federal state , Rio on site 16 , &quot; writes them .
extra belongs to the Glo@@ bo , the largest media company of South America , which stressed like Cec@@ í@@ lia , has been stressed the security policy of the state .
this safety @-@ policy measures also belonged to the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia Paci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the federal state of Rio in 2003 , whose aim is to con@@ quer a F@@ av@@ ela to con@@ quer and become a unit permanently there .
in the beginning this was actually led to a decrease of violent deaths . for some years , the U@@ PP organ@@ ises the U@@ PP but after several reports about ra@@ can@@ es and repres@@ sions against the poor communities that should protect the newly created police unit , increasingly being under attack .
on his Facebook page , the journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux from one of his articles from 2010 , in which he explains why the violence in Rio do not correspond to the &quot; Civil War &quot; criteria for the design@@ ation &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as war is also serious consequences for the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for this is ur@@ ging the state to act funds and paths that are typical of a war . this includes in@@ compar@@ ing into the territory of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enemy &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coll@@ ater@@ al damage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wo@@ unded balls &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

since the beginning of the Syrian Revolution in 2011 and in the following civil war many Syrian cities are suffering the brut@@ al exposure and block@@ ages , mainly by the Assad &apos;s regime towards loyal troops .
according to vic@@ tories , a joint initiative of the Peace organisation PA@@ X and the Forschungs@@ institut The Hague Institute , are located in Damascus and the United Kingdom , H@@ oms , D@@ ei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ lib currently around one million Syri@@ ans in a state of exposure .
especially strongly affected by the region of East Gh@@ out@@ a , where an attack on chemical weapons took on 21 August 2013 .
many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition assume it based on investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organizations that practi@@ sed the mass@@ ac@@ re of Assad &apos;s regime .
since 2013 , those of reb@@ els controls controlled areas outside of Damascus , which led to that citizens are dependent on local or through tun@@ nels and control points .
due to the long block@@ age traditional foods such as meat has become at@@ tainable for large parts of the population .
as a counter @-@ pro@@ claim a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and academ@@ ics , the inhabitants of the Gh@@ out@@ as , as they can plant their own mushrooms as &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ ent@@ da and run the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mush@@ room does not belong to traditional foods in Syria and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian kitchen . however , it makes them an attractive food source for many inhabitants of the besi@@ eged East Gh@@ out@@ a .
the content of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we decided for the cultivation of fung@@ i , because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr. Ah@@ med L@@ eil@@ a , one of the organiz@@ ers , reports Global Vo@@ ices , that has been fighting for three years , this project is well @-@ known and supp@@ ressed its relief from that it is now becoming more and more &quot; in famili@@ arity . &quot;
in order to collect money for the initiative , people in consultation with the NGO Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ am is the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do .
it is planned to provide 125 family knowledge to pl@@ anting by mush@@ room , so Dr. L@@ eil@@ a zu Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached more than 100 % of its expected target of approximately 12.@@ 700 € but will continue to collect donations from Monday , 04 September 2017 .
the initiative is reli@@ ant on generators , who keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
because of the fuel short@@ age , locally made greenhouse is used for plastic surgery to supply the generators with the necessary energy .
Dr. L@@ eil@@ a said Global Vo@@ ices , that they began with the &quot; Production of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prin@@ ci@@ li@@ ative &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; before they are aud@@ ited their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then they planted a small mush@@ room in a tub . as this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they designed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; faculty building for the region &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months they have made mushrooms all over the Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge .
Dr. L@@ eil@@ a stated that it is part of a larger motion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the mushrooms for various reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : break of exposure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
provision of a new food source on the market .
spread of a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency , by eating rest ( like paper , tea , coff@@ es@@ atz , cardboard , etc ) for the extraction of new foodstuffs .
create new jobs , especially for women working at home .
create new jobs for people with disabilities who are bound to their home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to spread this idea all over the world , so that our success as well as our fight against the hunger and the exposure is visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experiences to be inspired in crisis areas and we can help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese , we demand justice for the victims of 2017
several hundred people prot@@ ested on 21 October in many district buildings in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of fires that gr@@ ated in the north of Portugal .
two @-@ four people died , and about 70 were in@@ ju@@ red as a result of wild@@ fires from the 15th and 16th of October . this led to the fact that the government invited the last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days a state of state .
fires were also registered in the region of Galicia in Spain , where there were 4 dead @-@ ote .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire@@ out@@ breaks that spread out in the northern and central regions of the country and reached approximately 250 million acres of forest and numerous villages .
in June it occurred in Pedr@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande a similar tragedy , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 branches .
according to the European integration system , which monitors the forest areas via satellite recording , are burned alone in Portugal about 500@@ ,000 acres of forest , a surface area of the size of the district of Lisbon .

the lon@@ gl@@ able tragedy
the aim of the protests of the Saturday was the demand for better prevention and fire fighting measures by the state .
people asked why the civil guard was not able to counter the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ ão So@@ ver@@ al from the covenant of the farmers of Portugal explained the newspaper P@@ ú@@ bli@@ co :
after Pedr@@ ó@@ g@@ ão streets and villages for everything and nothing ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ated .
this Sunday they did so nowhere : there are approximate reports of open streets that were shut down by fire .
in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy could happen again as in June as the streets were closed very late . &quot;
additionally , building permit is ques@@ tioned in Ö@@ r@@ t@@ abilities with high Bran@@ dr@@ isi@@ ko .
a broad proposal to the Wal@@ dre@@ form , which had brought the government to serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was launched by the municipalities which saw new rules as an obstacle to investments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government led a lo@@ os@@ ening of the law , if the applic@@ ants had any means to self @-@ guard , that was an open back@@ door , so that everything could be built , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val is further developed in the same article of the newspaper P@@ ú@@ bli@@ co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the environment organization Qu@@ erc@@ us made aware that large areas with eu@@ cal@@ yp@@ tus , trees made of slightly burning wood , like in a Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ reis , according to the fires of this species .
to these problems occur that the website of the civil protection of Portugal on 15 and 16 October , when the local inhabitants were looking for or tried to contact , which was available offline .
it was a private initiative that uses the people with information : they used their own civili@@ z@@ ment data using the application fo@@ g@@ os@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real time across the location and spread of fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developer of Jo@@ ão P@@ ina , in order to simplify the work of fire bri@@ g@@ ade , and was ch@@ ained at this fat@@ eful weekend in October , that the server se@@ ams did not apply : the site mat@@ tered more than half a million requests .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the He@@ z@@ b Fo@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat was just mur@@ dered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara felt suddenly protecting .
the Taliban known for its hat@@ red on the Haz@@ o @-@ known Taliban is always closer .
many Haz@@ ara closing the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
some days after its escape as@@ cer@@ es found itself in Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a cohesion . the work was difficult and made him sick .
then he took what was left of his little reward , and went to Iran . once again he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and se@@ ed sacks with a mort@@ ar , the he@@ avier than he himself , to earn his living .
at that time as today life af@@ gh@@ an@@ ic refugees in Iran were dominated by mis@@ ery and exploitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was really tough , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remin@@ ded A@@ shar@@ k in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an abandoned building on the job@@ site , on which we also worked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no services and no heating there . we took nylon in front of the open windows , so that we do not sleep at night . &quot;
after four years , Ash@@ shar@@ k left his life without papers in Iran and ready for the journey to Europe .
during the dangerous over@@ ride on the sea he expi@@ red shipping and stran@@ ded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek Auth@@ orities had ref@@ used to have rejected the asylum from 2002 to Italy .
some time was A@@ ar@@ af hom@@ eless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church which distributed twice a day food for ne@@ edy people .
it is true that Italy is a kind of second chance for expi@@ red asylum seek@@ ers . it is true , however , that the conditions , the asylum seek@@ ers in the country found , cat@@ astrop@@ hic .
the civil liber@@ ties of the Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system &quot; suff@@ ers from a general lack of transparency .
the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers is housed in the more than 3000 &quot; special reception centres . &quot; this is impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot;
according to Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be assigned to a reception center if they officially asked a request on asylum - which can be pul@@ ling off after the registration of an asylum process .
until then , people who have no money for accommodation to rely on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the road .
so it was also as@@ cer@@ tained .
but his im@@ itable lif@@ ec@@ om@@ ile helped to liber@@ ate himself from these conditions .
after having made several years of working in the construction sector , A@@ shar@@ k tasted its entire savings into the establishment of a youth hostels in Venice .
this went so well that after a while he was still a second hostel and a sn@@ ake opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ k Bar@@ atis Succ@@ ess Story is now subject to the documentary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) of the director A@@ min Wah@@ i@@ di . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the film received the Venice City Award 2017 , which was already being awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just a few of the obstacles .
according to in@@ official estimates about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transi@@ tional solution on the way to other European countries .
in recent years some of Afgh@@ ans have emerged , including cut@@ ters , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afgh@@ an restaurants have even been pra@@ ised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ m@@ adi had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iter and the kitchen staff were mostly taken from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant is told by the various Afgh@@ an , Ira@@ qi , Turkish and Greek dishes , the history of their trip to Italy .
the Afgh@@ an entrepreneurs Ali Kh@@ an Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Padua the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a Sushi Restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
but A@@ shar@@ k goals are enough , however far beyond the Italian Gastronom@@ i@@ eg@@ e@@ wer@@ be and the retail@@ er and aim to leave the country that he had to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; where a risk is , are also possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ k with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan .
I never forget my country and I cannot live happy if I know that my people suff@@ ers .
I am planning a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country , especially for women .
they represent half of the society and have to get the same possibilities as everyone else . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af leads also plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul where people can learn from packaging and preser@@ vatives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can they sell their seri@@ ousness on the market and improve their financial situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the development of successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubts , but at the end stand stability and prosperity .
A@@ fal@@ af has made this journey itself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .

the Egyptian parliament checks a draft which fores@@ ees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration in a government agency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the user must be able to take advantage of the social networks within six months after the participation of the authority under specification of their full name and exp@@ ul@@ sion number . &quot; &quot; &quot;
wh@@ o@@ ever dre@@ amed this step , could be sentenced to six months of prison , or sentenced to a criminal off@@ ended .
the law , which was advertis@@ ed by six@@ ty female members , is currently under legislative and constitu@@ tion@@ ists of the Parliament and should be deb@@ ated there .
in May another member of the Member State shall be a draft which would be introduced to the tough@@ er pen@@ alties for the president or high officials .
under the Egyptian law , the ins@@ ult@@ ing of the president as well as state institutions are already pun@@ ish@@ able . under the proposal , such an act would be attacked with pr@@ isons and money orders , as well as ordin@@ ates of Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
should the law be adopted , this can be up to three years imprisonment for the condem@@ ned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , this would be a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly is already in danger for many years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photograph@@ ers Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ h ) which was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he demonstrated violence against demonstr@@ ators who had demonstrated against the military cou@@ p , who had led to the Am@@ amm@@ ite fac@@ tion of the elected President Moh@@ amm@@ ed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan wa@@ ited for as much more than 700 Protest@@ ants who were arrested at the same incident , four years in cu@@ sto@@ dy to a pen@@ ute .
recently , his trial opened on 20 May because the pr@@ isons of human rights groups had failed to bring the prison quarters of the prison in the court @-@ room .
Sha@@ w@@ kan thre@@ w the death penalty on the basis of such , so many human rights groups agree , head@@ stress of e.g. ar@@ ef@@ acts , illegal gathering , murder and betra@@ y@@ al murder .
in another case , a pen@@ al court in Gi@@ za the two journalists h@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary were free . they were charged for their reporting on the pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block on the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo .
the court also reduced the pen@@ alties of the journalists Ab@@ dul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly that were arrested in advance by the previously mentioned incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
Tun@@ isian activi@@ sts are sent to sent documents
may the Tun@@ isian authorities spent six hours with the trial of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , which is co @-@ founder of the independent media platform N@@ awa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices of Adv@@ oc@@ acy project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia was mainly employed by the president of the Republic , according to the Plan explicitly a contro@@ versi@@ al bill , supported by the business@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali the corruption acc@@ used officials ref@@ used to give them all un@@ law@@ ful funds .
the document on 21 April on the website of N@@ awa@@ ate published document , thro@@ ws a light on how the conc@@ entri@@ c plans look like to support the template .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia f@@ ake the disclosure of his sources under speci@@ ation of article 11 of the Tun@@ isian freedom of press , which journalists have the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless he joined the District Court in Tunis on 09 . may as a witness in the case .
does China want to force the users of social media to present their credit card ?
according to new regulations of the Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users may need social media in China to write or share messages in social media .
the rules will also indicate that the registration will be required to the full real name .
an@@ alysts assume that the elimination of anonymous comments in subj@@ ection within social networks shall be reached . it is still un@@ clear how the authorities apply these rules .
Chinese networks have proposed in social media to en@@ force these regulations only to protect citizens &apos; journ@@ alism and its independence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; do we see ourselves in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
not in Russia !
may , the State Z@@ ens@@ ur of Russia for@@ got the access to the latest Chinese Mess@@ aging app .
according to Ros@@ kom@@ nad@@ z@@ or fo@@ amed white chat , to register at the provincial government as the &quot; organizer of the information spread . &quot;
this term is part of a law dating from 2014 , thanks to the Russian government a list of online services , which will organise the &quot; publication of information . &quot; the law also allows the government to make certain services responsible for removing content and to force them on request for the suspension of user data .
these websites are currently sites such as V@@ Kontakte and od@@ no@@ klass@@ ni@@ ki ( Russian two most popular social networks ) , the image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service mail@@ .ru and any other services .
tur@@ quoise dish has pl@@ ur@@ ged Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
a Turkish dish had tri@@ pedi@@ gree wi@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia @-@ administr@@ ators to delete , two English @-@ speaking articles , the statements , Turkey support the ji@@ ha@@ dist@@ s in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Turkish Ministry for Transport , maritime affairs and communication has been blocked because they are led to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a source of information that works together with groups to send a political diff@@ usion campaign against Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first time Turkey blocked the site completely . it is therefore , in addition to China , one of the few countries worldwide , where access to Wikipedia is not possible .
