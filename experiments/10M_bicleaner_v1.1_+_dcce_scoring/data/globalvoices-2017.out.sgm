<seg id="1">Although I visited the US for at least once a year, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is exceptionally large.</seg>
<seg id="4">As many of my generation I grew up with American films, led to American music, American authors read and operated his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I became mainly because of an American film journalist.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Gotham in The Pelican letter, a fearless reporter with the help of Julia Roberts described as Jura Studentin der tigerderous conspiracy, the Supreme Federal Criminal Tribunal with strains that had his interest to occupy.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "free after method Man," "" "I was, as if that is the absolute truth, everything else is, it's what I want to make with my life." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the USA had only been reinforced.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "I said:" "" "America is the only country in which I ever lived, whose variety is as welcoming as you can always be that you are and it's easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had a very cold love letter written about his greatness.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">A lot has been written by xenophobia and racism this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me as he embraces with his bottling.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never holds behind the mountain behind the mountain as you say so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">He tells exactly what he thinks of what a former colleague is expressed, and explains publicly its contempt for Muslims, Latinos, AfroAmerican and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless the people have responded to his statements and voted for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes, which he won with the Republican elections, was the highest number ever achieved by the party of nominized candidat.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support these bigry person, asked me?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not get gump and did not get to know his voters with the people I met in Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">As for example my Professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program that record people from all over the world, a deep believer Man with whom I could talk about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also, separating mumps is not associated with the Peter Bhatia, the present editor of the "Cincinnati Inquer" in fact.</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhuta and I had hit us with our shared love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the "Phoenix Sun."</seg>
<seg id="25">Mumps intolerance is also in contrast to generosity that I lived at Sandy Bahr, who fought for life long, and her husband Dave, my host family who like their son.</seg>
<seg id="26">She also fits her to the dedication of Kristi Kappit, who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace to me and my colleagues helped to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew Mariey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wiser advice has helped me much at my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and those by embodied values deepened my love of America.</seg>
<seg id="29">As Trump its way to the nominized republican presidential, they sent me a grip and the counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">But it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016, over 50 million Americans, mostly pasture, the Presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps due to its contempt against non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The confrontation with the idea that people voted for ump because they either shared his racism and fanaticism, or because they were prepared to overlook these things, broke me almost the heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to describe the ump-voters as a crassists.</seg>
<seg id="34">The people to arrange, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and respectful and indicates an inability to understand those in a different way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows the people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, of which most know are, for dreump, because they would like to regain control of a country that she disapsed?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might want to say that in this America they are still important?</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick who commented the cruel decision to descend a man who look with contempt on those that look differently from it.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "whitelash" (Anm. d.).: as much as "disation of the whites against all other ethnic"; vocabulary from white in touch on the whites and whiplash, as the great Van Jones intrified, has made exactly what America has done so great.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American Ideal - no matter whether the myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - which faith or background you may have always like, America is every welcome.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this land chose as its president, twice the son of a Kenyan, whose story, as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the choice of Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge part of the white missionary of America this promise and says: to hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11, the white man is again at the ruin, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">In all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a manifestation for Hillary Clinton had Mr. Khan exchange-change with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would have my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd answered with a lautstrong "No!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"" "" "" "would Muslims have a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" brolled the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="52">"" "" "" "have Latinos a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" answering it.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they and their voices were louder." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"if anyone who is not like you, a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">"" "he received a vocative and loudly strong" "" "NEIN" "" "!" ""</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan concluded with the words: "God is thanks, Mr. Trump, is that not your America." 36 hours later he was informed.</seg>
<seg id="59">The land, for which his son was fallen, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">That is now Trumps country, told the message.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan, could not find a place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And this breaks me my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero community in the province of Oaxaca with the children of the paraguaean town Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">That the music that is played in both places not only the lives of children, but also a very close contact with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music which lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump, only 16 km south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city which is very popular among tourists -but worlds away from nearby prequbian ruins and its world-famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For some years now, the La Banda de música (Musikbande) in the municipality: one of the children and adults of the existing Symphony Orchestra, which has found an opportunity for overcoming poverty.</seg>
<seg id="74">A Musikschule with 100 students is for the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The community, which is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for their drugs abuse and the ties of ties.</seg>
<seg id="77">However, this changed after a random encounter with a French pilots who started a musical project and the youth offered so a rare hopelessness.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their obligations towards the music group extremely seriously, means the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">Once they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the narrow roads to meet their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They come always with shiny and with shiny eyes and play in the Trubel you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, Waldhorn, Pauke, Bongos and the Conga to play.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from Müll</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometers south of Vicente Guerrero, the children of Cateura - a village that is practically at the largest garbage dump of Asunción in Paraguay's capital - on instruments that are made of recycled waste materials:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with restored instruments, which consist of local firm waste materials, made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recycling under the direction of Favio Chávez started to turn parts of the crash into instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitate violins, viola, damar, guitars, flutes, saxophone, trumpets, trombones and percussion, all made out of the rubbish.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article in the Los Angeles Times Favio Chávez, a local sociologist and the musician instructor of the children of Cateura, to the beginning of the early days:</seg>
<seg id="87">First, it was very difficult since we had no place to rehearse and we had to teach at the same place, the kids had no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio was shown something that he had never seen before: one out of waste produced violin.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is a whole orchestra, which plays on instruments from repeated material and that is called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentation called "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) draws the musical performance on:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates around a billion tons of trash each year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and of him are the poorest countries like the people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here she turn him into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with his inspiring spectacle from Müll-To-Music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra has even played his music against Pope Francis:</seg>

<seg id="97">Photo © Fish-i Africa - a project that is fighting the wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reported on international, practiced solutions for environmental problems.</seg>

<seg id="100">In West Africa, at that time, the ship was already known in Lebanese waters illegal fishing, before it searched the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were accordingly more intentioned and little geneive to welcome a legislative breaker of this kind on their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the coms, Mozambique and the Seychelles mobilized themselves quickly against the ship. they refused to give him one of their harbours and sojourned to give him a fishing creational.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "suddenly the prime minister has been surrounded by countries that you just had to do everything," "" "recalls Benedict Kiilu, a leading employee of the Kenyan fisherman Authority. he is part of a team that discovered the ship at the time and followed." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013 the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: it was not able to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Ultimately, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, because of the pillage of the land.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which criminfies and protects resources, Fish-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NRO Stop illegal Fishing (Illegal fishery).</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are besides Somalia and Madagascar the six countries, who had driven the prime minister out of their waters at that time.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "" "" "we have eight countries that are equal and working together. they exchange information out and stand on each other in where it is to illegal fishing," "", "says Tony Long, Head of the Pew Charitable trust project. this project provides Fish-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is defined by definition: what is trapped, is hidden that because it is extremely difficult to escalate. thus, the illegal fishing is a prime minister of survival of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">By divisible misempt of existing laws, by which certain habitats and species are to be protected, can harm the illegal fishing of ecosystems that have been a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">However, while actions against illegal fishing was once formed by bureaucratic hurdles, and also through the beeckerempo, with the information between individual countries, so the promotions happen today in real time, with traceable on Fish-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, the individual countries can interact with each other for example lists of existing licences, news on verdant activities or details that have noticed or experienced during a longterm perspective.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very attentive when they move around the open sea using satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows the authorities to mark ships that fishes in verotene areas. also, as suspects the routes that a ship invites its finished fish on the way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such studies may show whether the participating ships have a fish license, where they were on the road and eventually, whether they have a criminal law.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing, can be found on the basis of this information then acceptance of such ships in their ports. and that means that the ships will not sell their charges. and that they can even be forced to enter penalties, as in the case of the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "then there is significant financial losses for the owner, which means the illegal fishing of fishing does not pay any more financially." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">And that's what we want to achieve, "says Per Erik Bergh, Senior Director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consultant company that advocates for the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and thereby supports Fish-i.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to attract valued 20 million USD to abandoned sales, the eight members of the network HISH-i each year lost due to illegal fishermen that penetrate into East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">Eastern Africa has one of the most productive tuna-fish species, present because of the region's commercial fishing from all over the world. among these also those illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="122">Among their practices inter alia, such as the sailing under false flag, counterfeit license papers, indication of fantasies, the fusioned species and the fish in nature reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "" "" "they are targeting the lack of international co-operation and make up the weaknesses of any organised control system" "", "said Long." "" "earlier, a ship was illegal and a country could then say" "" "You dared my port not to run" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "but another country could say" "" "Come to me" "". "and this is precisely this legal gorge, trying to close Fish-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="125">Until now the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, Fish-i has participated in more than 30 examinations.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has criminal networks exposed to split counterfeit licenses in Tanzania. there were ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has been persecuted and found jven ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to its cooperation with Interpol, the International Authority on the fight against crime, Fish-i may share information on illegal fishing over great distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "" "" "some of our investigations lead us pretty far into the networks organized crime," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>

<seg id="131">Photo with kind permission of Fish-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is always updated, also helps the illegal ships disagree with it.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "" "" "illegal fishing use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and position," "" "says Duncan Copeland, Chefanalyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, one NRO, which also deals with fisheries data and Fish-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships used for instance their automatic identification systems, with which they can no longer be processed by satellite.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland helps to build a system that connects different information levels. it aims to help fish-i to find criminal vessels with bigger precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But Fish-i's team can actually influence African nations to the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth can set up with Google and the marine protection organisation Oceana the platform Global Fishing Watch: a platform that offers satellite data, and by means of which the position of each tractable shipping can be displayed worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "" "" "together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who, what is doing - this is simply sense," "" "he says." "" "here's a chance for countries to unite and to bundle their resources for investigation." ""</seg>

<seg id="142">There are signs that Fish-i's activities do not only feel criminals, but also shoppers.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships used to confiscated earlier without any license and hardly have to reckon with consequences, now they know that they are observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries involved in Fish-i are now offering a 33% increase of fisheries worldwide since fishing boats buy more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After Fish-i Somalia had helped, Greko 1, the inspectors found there on board towing, whose use is prohibited.</seg>

"" "with safety is the target, even more such initiatives and structures also arise in other regions," "" "says Copeland." ""</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, Fish-i's youngest member of Somalia was on his first big triumph: in October there was Greko 1, a ship that was on the wrong flag. and not only was the ship used without a license, and were used as opposed networks used by now.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the ship was also penetrated in verotene waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "" "with the taking of measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they fight against illegal fishing," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>

<seg id="197">This is an adapted version of a interview of Alejo Gómez with Luis Quijano, which was received on 23 August 2016 on Día a Día, an Argentinian message page.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to join the atrocity in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentinean town of Córdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As meanwhile, Quijano told Quijano now as part of the great La Perla-Ribera process in the province of Cordoba, against his father.</seg>
<seg id="201">The trial concluded on 24 August 2016, crimes were examined, which were committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano has not chosen his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Starting at the Bürde, the same name as his father bear witness to the brutal militarism in the prison of La Perla, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough suffered.</seg>
<seg id="204">34 years of all, he kept the surrendered for himself.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation back then I believed that was fine.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a salent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child of 15 years you will not notice that you will be manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time I could not know that my father was a thief, Folterer and murderer.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was Gendimeriebeamter. during the Argentinean military dictatorship of 1974 to 1983, a time of state terrorism, was his father from 1976 to 1978 Deputy Kommandeur of the Secret Services Section 141 in the prison La Perla.</seg>
<seg id="210">Luis Alberto Quijano.</seg>
<seg id="211">Datesarming.</seg>
<seg id="212">But this is not the story of Luis Quijano, the oppressors who was indicted for kidnapping in 158 cases, torture, murder in nearly 100 cases and the abduction of a 10-year child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijanos son, a man who had experienced the extent of the atrocities that he had experienced as a boy, and who said before a Federal court against his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows what great power has a parent with his child and how this child chose a path of salvation.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">For translators, one needs two important skills: passive language skills to understand the initial text and to translate active language skills to get it into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter calls for active fideletion of target language - something that is case with mothertongue. in general, the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the starting language - native speakers should be.</seg>
<seg id="379">This should be a French native speakers for example from English into French - not from the French into English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr-User Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ workers with English as a native language, which might sound translations into English. this may be misunderstood as a lack of understanding of the translator, the reasons, or the relatively small number of English speakers that learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies that even do not have foreign employees, make translations yet firmed. then the Japanese employee will be judged as the best one to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language knowledge really are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr-User Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translations are also widespread - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The worrted and puzzling propositions which arise through mechanical translations, show that this technique does not yet replace a human translator. this applies to some languages very special.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strange English phrases in Japan, including even the puzzling bags, often used t-shirts or handhelds, are only used for stylish reasons - not to be read or even understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo of Flickr-users Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be either acceptable or at least harmless. but by large companies or by the government who have the means to ensure higher standards, you can expect careful translations.</seg>

<seg id="461">At the same time, they had to share the time so that you still remained time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">She stood at five o'clock in the morning and prepared the breakfast for their employer.</seg>
<seg id="463">For example, they purified the fridge, purified the living room, pin the furniture and desigfied the floor.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was at the end, she went back home and had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="465">The sooner they were finished with learning, the more free time had it.</seg>
<seg id="466">But even this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employer.</seg>
<seg id="467">Alvarenga, she had to never hunger, but I also didn't get unrestricted food. "I was allowed to pick up more books from the library of the housewife as food from the fridge."</seg>
<seg id="468">The library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord, a former military and sympathizers of the Partido Liberal, a liberal party that was in power from 1954 to 1989 on the opposition.</seg>
<seg id="469">At several evenings of the landlord Alvarenga, to stand alongside him and editorial notes from Oppositionszeitungen, like "Sendero" or "El Pueblo."</seg>
<seg id="470">He tried to convince them to give no faith in the reports of the official media on the regime of dictator.</seg>
<seg id="471">He kept her to be intelligent, but did not pause with her. "the landlord had found someone who listened, while he spoke about politics," she says.</seg>
<seg id="472">"they allowed me not often to visit my family because they were the opinion that I would learn there" bad habit "." that they suppose that Alvarenga, which would speak for the indigenous group of Guaraní again, at home again her motherlanguage Guaraní would speak.</seg>
<seg id="473">Their Lord feared that she had the education they had enabled to lose again, explained them.</seg>
<seg id="474">But her was absolutely clear that she got paid for everything they had paid by them with their hard work.</seg>
<seg id="475">Also in school, Alvarenga has been discriminated. "one thing that is almost never talked about, bullying and the rakanes that Criaditas are exposed when they go to school.</seg>
<seg id="476">Because the other children parents have parents, they recognize immediately that someone who has no parents who has no parents, a criadita is.</seg>
<seg id="477">I could not invite anyone to go home. I had no friends in school or in the neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="478">In my youth, in the time where friendships arise, I felt especially clear that I was not owned by any group.</seg>
<seg id="479">The isolation was the worst of all, "explains Alvarenga.</seg>

<seg id="527">Why is this specific type of leopards so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">As Raza shows in the video, "the Persian leopard is the only surviving revenge in the Kurdish ecosystem," and the health and the ability of the ecosystem also depends on that a large radeaf is present.</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian leopards in fact is low and goes against zero. when the team in the video therefore presents that they have a recording of a big cat in Cameroafall, Raza immersed in pure joy.</seg>

<seg id="544">In the beginning of March 2017 documented, which were awarded for the Northeast of Japan, the progress made in the last six years to rebuild the lives of those who were affected by the "Trinity disaster" of March 2011. a vast earthquake, a tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima had triggered a catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in the prefecture of Miyagi. the prefecture of Miyagi was a great prefecture in Japan in the north-east, both of them had to experience the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighboring leaders of Fukushima and Iwate have been mutuated, because the tsunami had all the coastal cities to disappear from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">Yet the prefecture of Fukushima lived an atomic accident, already alone it had to leave 160 000 inhabitants their houses.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows from local view which progress achieved six years later to rebuild the life of local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper contains both statistics of Japanese rebuilding and survey results of the people affected itself.</seg>
<seg id="550">The housing in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reported that until December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement houses (or of them take), saigai kouei juutaku) in the prefectures of Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="552">The biggest success among the three prefectures could draw Miyagi, here 80 per cent of the planned replacement houses were finished.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has finished 75 percent of such houses, where Fukushima is formed with 70 percent the final light.</seg>
<seg id="554">However, they still strive for six years after the disaster, evacuated of Behaviors (Signed each of them, Kazetsu juutaku) in final replacement parts.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the three-fold catastrophe, nearly 80 000 people saw forced to live in shelters.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016 there still lived 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate in such containers.</seg>
<seg id="557">Nearly 40 percent of the Fukushima still live in emergency accommodation, whereas even more than 75 percent of the evacuates who grew up after the disaster in sheltered shelters, were killed in final homes.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate the number is here at 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three affected cities</seg>
<seg id="560">As the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper could identify, 1074 of 1100 schools, who were affected by the unhappiness, their Pforks were back to December 2016, which makes almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, the industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is much more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While nearly 100 percent of fisheries harbors in Iwate and Miyagi are now back into operation, have resumed their operation in Fukushima only 30 percent of the fishing ports.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the atomic accident, have drawn in the three prefectures of agricultural land-large-scale in co-passions.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas, with only 66 percent of the agricultural land in Iwate, and less than 50 percent of the Ackerland in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is only a consequence of nuclear unfailures, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares destroyed feuds of Fukushima, are located in the "nuclear wave zone."</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures the tourism has stepped up again, but also here Fukushima remains far away.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are up to 90 percent at the same level as in front of the unhappiness. Fukushima on the other hand can only 75 per cent have.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reported that since the disaster almost half of the coast-inhabitants, it's harder to earn their livelihoods.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to determine a total picture, the newspaper introduced numerous surveys among the native population and among the evacuates. she asked them about the state of rebuilding and also how to feel her sensation in front of the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction of the article explains the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku shimpo led a survey by providing more about the tsunami awareness among the native population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey complied that 83.1 percent of the local residents, measures have taken to be prepared for the future earthquake and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of the respondents that was still not done enough in catastrophes prevention.</seg>
<seg id="575">How it comes to those who had to evacuated from the prefecture of Fukushima</seg>
<seg id="576">In her output to the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has also enhanced its attention on the situation of the Evacuates of Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima not only had to experience the huge earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, the prefecture of Fukushima was also witness of the worst, disastrous, atomic, disastrous, disastrous in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="578">From 160 000 evacuation from Fukushima nearly 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016, somewhat more than 23 000 people have been resumed back to Fukushima, in long lasting spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="580">After the booth of 2017 there is still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside their home-prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the Katastrophenareas, most of the evacuation issues are still older than 50 years old. you have to withdraw from right couplings, because the efforts for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima must compete with massive construction projects. this is the construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games, the 2020 will be held in Tokyo.</seg>

<seg id="583">When people meet from other countries that speak a different language, the differences seem to be greater than the similarities.</seg>
<seg id="584">After a while, you often recognize that one more connects than it seems at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global connections are important as they challenge our prejudices to extend our perspectives and remind us that the world ultimately is very small.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this episode of Into the Deep, the Global Voices podcast, we look at exactly these global connections. in our Into the Deep Podcast, we treat topics covered in reporting often less attention as they deserve.</seg>
<seg id="587">We speak with five Global Voices members who remember a moment where they have felt very strong with someone over language and national borders.</seg>
<seg id="588">Veroniki Krikoni talks about the similarities of Greek and Turkish; Tori Egherini explains how the love of music has consolidated its affection for Iranian culture; Adriana Macias talks about the time when she worked with people from all over the world; and Joey Ayoub looks back on his experiences that he collected in a small village in Madagascar.</seg>

<seg id="596">Mateus Ferreira da Silva, the social sciences at the University of Goiás, has studied a skull-pastas and several fractures.</seg>
<seg id="597">Physicians operied him this Saturday and have put it into a artificial koma.</seg>
<seg id="598">Its condition is regarded as critical.</seg>
<seg id="599">The local sculpture Luiz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mateus which quickly spread over a few days rapidly in Brazil.</seg>
<seg id="600">On the pictures also the face of the police record was identified, the one with a stroke. the man was identified as Augusto Sampaio.</seg>
<seg id="601">After the incident, the military police in the Brazilian State of Goiás was known that Sampaio, until the conclusion of the investigation of the incident of the active service is suspended.</seg>
<seg id="602">The pictures show the police officers, as he suggests in Goiânia with his drummer on the face of the student Mateus Ferreira (Photos: Luiz da Luz).</seg>
<seg id="603">If a police knocked out of a protesters and land on the Intensive station, his face would see six months long on TV and the entire oppression would be justified.</seg>
<seg id="604">The Facebook-Page "Desneuralizador," a press channel of media activists from Goiânia, shared by Luiz da Luz there recorded video on the net, in which one sees how Mateus from the police officers is attacked and several sanitary shortly afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="605">Another video with the same scenes, but from another perspective also filmed it has appeared in the social networks.</seg>
<seg id="606">In the table shown below you can see the attack on Mateus from the 50th second.</seg>
<seg id="607">For the family of Mateus, who lives in another federal state, in the meantime, we have donated 10,000 Brazilian cais (approximately 2,700 Euro) to cover a portion of the cost of medical treatment and to keep his family in Goiânia, while he is in the hospital.</seg>

<seg id="612">On Facebook, Professor Pablo Ortellado calls for further violence against activists in Goiás to the memory:</seg>
<seg id="613">Goiás experienced a wave of political force: here the activator was killed by his father, and here was the Military Police of a WhatsApp group, and now we have been attacked the Occupy movement of Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who has been attacked on the Intensive station, after being attacked by a policeman, who has beaten him with a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="614">Police transfer</seg>
<seg id="615">Goiás was not the only state in Brazil in which it came to brutal police officers against demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="616">Police officers continued in protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro, where demonstrators had built a stage for Redner, Gummigeschosse and Tränengas.</seg>
<seg id="617">The MP Flavio Serafini, Social and Peace Party (PSOL), asked the police on loudspeaker through violence against demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="618">This also includes a report in folha de S. Paulo, one of the oldest newspapers around the country.</seg>
<seg id="619">Once again the Brazilian media roadworks have delayed by putting the focus on another, unexpected protagonists: a window-plate.</seg>
<seg id="620">The folha de S. Paulo and Estado de S. Paulo reported targeted on a distress glass pane to render their titles illustrative with a photo.</seg>
<seg id="621">On the other hand the O Globo fake a front story with a fire laid on by a fire.</seg>
<seg id="622">There is no plausible journalistic base, more on a broken window-screen than about the protests of thousands of people who serve the defense of a special thing.</seg>
<seg id="623">This also has to recognise you if you are strictly against any form of damage.</seg>
<seg id="624">Here is also the term "Vandalism" a absurdity, disproportionate meaning, and the typical violence of the military police are deceived by headlines with the title "demonstrators on confrontational path with the police.</seg>

<seg id="627">The folk community Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is generally known as a el Central - to Spanish Zuckermühle - regardless of what there is no nutable sugar-sugar on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years ago when the activities in the sugar factories are lapped.</seg>
<seg id="629">After the fall, the sugar cane industry was silent in the region and the factory lost gradually and after its facilities, until only the rumors of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to be found again.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some are rarely the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Other resigned and commuting every day to the factories that still die.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a soldier's veteran, which stands up every day at 4: 00 in the morning, the crisis in the sugars industry do not smoke its sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that it is in the east of the region sugar factories that have been in operation after a long inactive time because they have been received.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he was not expecting.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene reminds us exactly that in Mañalich would receive the sugar cane factory, but the promise was not held.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugars industry already resisted the plagues, the case of socialism, the low market prices, the inefficiency, the poor management decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, the production was 1.6 million tons of sugar, less than 1910 produced consumed.</seg>
<seg id="639">The message would have been a motif for a scared scared for the country, but the bad harvests are already no more fancy.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why has the Cuban Zuckerrohrindustry was turned off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway drive of the church looked even better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 Zuckerrohrfabriken were technically outdated, and hardly competitive, they were inviable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to focus the production on the most efficient factories, the annual production objective was 4 million tons.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left the factories which can produce sugar for maximum 4 Centavos (0.03 euros).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives, which resulted in such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the crisis rise on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nonetheless, the sugar rate got back about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025 the price of unrefined sugar is to stay between 15 and 16 Centavos per pounds, according to the report issued in the report of the Council of Economics' from the OECD and FAO, the agricultural and nutritional organization of the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tons), the raw sugar export of around 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>

<seg id="652">"" "" "" "today's day will come down with certainty in the history, that were the first words of the Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lavandero." ""</seg>
<seg id="653">From that there began the process of restructuring in the sugar industry.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years, the stagnation of a total of 98 sugar units, more than 65 million people got their full salaries for further training.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the Zuckerrohrfabrik Gregorio Arlée Mañalich on 14 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto Pérez has worked for 1967 in the factory.</seg>
<seg id="657">"" "if Nene, as he is known as a soldier, talk about the closing of the factory, the word he is most repeated," "" "fraud" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="658">Nearly all respondents are the same opinion, not one of them has been informed that the factory would be silent.</seg>
<seg id="659">So that the place will get, they formed a full time - working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">In front of the first year of the first year, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was officially dismissed documents that would only be removed in relation to the parts that would be removed, the address and date of the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the Minister could host any withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From that point the responsibility of the days and the letters have always been more frequent.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the breasted factory for two years and he was one who received British letters. "the country had no money for which sugar farms.</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years, waiting for the retirement in another facility, the Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>

<seg id="692">Young people of the First Nations communities in the whole Canada are dealing with issues that are important to them. do they do with Hip Hop, thanks to a number of hiking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan-Tour for 2014 Workshopleiter mobile Tonstudios directly to schools and youth centers to teach youth groups Songwriting, recording, audio- and video-production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by the educator David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and in North Quebec with ten Cree-communities and then worked with the Cree Hip-Hop group The NorthStar.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop thus climbs that young participants in talks like "cultural identity, language, engagement, love, self acceptance," or whatever it comes in mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos where young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in the U.S. state of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' yoo in the area of the tribe of the Kitah First nation in British Columbia, for example the history of the highway 16, also called "highway of the tears," on which almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered.</seg>

<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motive of a video capture in order to convey the importance of maintaining traditional customs and customs, despite the influences of globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in Indigenous languages, although the young people do not always master the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the whapmagoostui Cree First Nation has taken, the chorus is sung by the Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people received a little help from Gary Jolly from the Northstars Hip-Hop group, who gives them a strophe in the dialect Eastern James Bay Cree-h.</seg>
<seg id="704">At the Facebooksite of N'we Jinan is the strophe available in conversion, as well as a translation into English, which is translated here into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel as if no one would ever be interested in me.</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to go on the earth for my days.</seg>
<seg id="707">That is the day when you are screened our cry</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports and foreign media on the harsh "struggle against the drug trading" in Mexico looks at regular intervals. however, they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy, which brings this battle with itself.</seg>
<seg id="750">The coverage of Drug Policy such as El Chapo Guzmán, the boss of the Sinaloa-Kartell, urred the stories of the victims of the conflict completely in the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">On the day after a violent prefall hardly anyone looks upon the grape or upon the communities who have learned to live with pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Behind each pastries, behind every bone of the hundreds, the stories of numerous parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds might never be able to heal.</seg>
<seg id="753">Therefore the Mexican news portal Animal Político, the digital project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "with the drug trading live), these victims should give a voice and stories of men who testified in the struggle between the prosecution authorities and cartels.</seg>

<seg id="773">The editors of "apra vivir con el narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">We do not only have to show the faces of those who face the fear. we must show the international community the conflicts, the fragility and state leadership.</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high risk-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reader of Animal Político, wrote this contribution from Taxco, the Federal State of Guerrero in Centralexiko.</seg>
<seg id="778">Your contribution reminds us that you should never look at violence as normal, no matter what form it appears:</seg>
<seg id="779">I have been familiar with disease and sensors journalism for several years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I'm passing each day at times of time tiques and see the front pages with pictures, which can actually only come from a textbook for criminal attorneys or from specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I have the feeling, as if I am the only one that is adverse or sad. it works as a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be synonymous with it or consider it as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">It writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks that he is Narco (German: drug dealers) will be if he is great. and it's not normal that people hear songs on the "heroism" of the offences when going through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is that they would diel those who have lost someone and those who have fear that they too have something like that.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness if stories are mere figures in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "the indigomnia of the people is unbelievable for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village are justified that they were" "" "offended." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they are trying to speak of such a tragedies, if they are not stirred and silent.</seg>
<seg id="790">"" "Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution" "" "four months exploring the capital city" "". "it describes how a family ended with threats now." "" "it describes how armed criminals reaches money from their business until they have not only destroyed the business but also their family apart." ""</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how many people can change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain about it never goes, the trauma remains, the fear comes again high, if you're alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, telephone numbers also.</seg>
<seg id="794">We just contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The further we are removed, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">It looked in its report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested, because you do not know when they will kidnap or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">I asked myself in this terrible days, if wines would solve my deepened feelings, but the answer is no, because I have forgotten how you wept. I must learn to live with pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">The journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega released the article "The forgotten children of Ciudad Juárez: a mature generation of violence."</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions on how: who cares about the child of a missing wife and a man who has been killed by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age whose parents take care of her.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a commodity and he tells that he had to teach himself how to make a egg coop, tortillas, and "Chichi" for the Babies who live with him. this is his name for preparing the vial of water, sugar and milk pulvers.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are unsignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a baby for all life of violence and he had to learn to live so.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, you told him that his mother was gone.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood has been past two years ago, than a few blocks away from his home, the bloody lyche of his father saw that was shot by armed men from a foregoing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez was born:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 as violence by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010 Juárez was the most vulnerable city in the world due to the number of statutes according to the indications of the Federal Council for Public Safety and the Government of the Government of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone the prosecutor 3103 Morde presented. this corresponds to the cut 8.5 murder per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are only a few of hundreds of thousands who organised crime in Mexico and penetrate the country's soul.</seg>
<seg id="814">Few stories always live in view of new headlines. however, this project reminds us of those that we must not forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco," Animal Político 2015, its objective is to present the complex information behind the failed fight against the drug-trade, which has hired the country in the last four decades, in a comprehensible way.</seg>

<seg id="950">Most of these lists cover Japanese, German, French, Portuguese, or Finnish words, while the author and linguist of "translation" Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">In the blog you can find for example words from the excl. language of Vanuatu, as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"" "" "" "vakasteglok" "" "- Look up your parents in recognition of how to strive for you in younger years." ""</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunswick language that are spoken in parts of Brazil as:</seg>

<seg id="1136">Can there be a possibility here and now despite a language barrier to contact someone?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the initiative Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS) is the incomes of stories in their original language a possible response to it.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices told about a different initiative by Steven Bird, the Unisonable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here however, the focus of TLS is not written on the written words, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language variety of big cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in Oakland in the United States, where TLS has already performed events since 2015, the risk that small and not quite so small languages are not passed on to the children there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">The following applies to the creators of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that have diversity, safe spaces where residents do not have to forget who they are to belong to them.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "during" "" "listen often associated with it," "" "purposes these events instead" "" "listening to estimate, to feel tie," "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format the storyteller presents their history first in their own language and then translate them into English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not a professional history of history, their devotion and their representation is that the audiences will be granted.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call laughter and emotions that the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video presents for example a traditional story of Burkina Faso, which is told in the language Dafing. during this round the histories narrator Rassidatou will also take the opportunity to explain for their country typical customs of brass.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event John Nyamusara tells the Fabel from the bunnies and the Pavian in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">"" "after having declared the meaning of his Fabel, John Nyamusara is in demand," "" "how is that to speak to an audience that does not understand your language?" "" "with a big smile, he shares his feeling of inclusiveness:" ""</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened!</seg>
<seg id="1151">You were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities and the organizers hope to expand it. all who are inspired by the project can be in contact with TLS to organise their own histories.</seg>

<seg id="1155">With the aim of a revisioning of public debt of Puerto Rico, which participated in 72 million US dollars, took place on the 3rd of April 2017 diverse religious and civil organizations in a mass demonstration; the march was started by the puertic Capitol, the government building of the capital, and ran to the Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Juan.</seg>

<seg id="1157">The intercessors of the debts of the debt have also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their call:</seg>
<seg id="1159">The people of Puerto Ricos demands that politicians, banks and government agencies responsible for debts are accountable for their corrupt.</seg>
<seg id="1160">We call for a financial inspection and a draft committee without personal interests in public debt, with a fixed, our working conditions corresponding to us, which in favor of the economy acts.</seg>
<seg id="1161">We become presentless and suppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">The people Puerto Ricos refuses to pay a debt that is not their own.</seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>
<seg id="1164">Our pensioners will not find themselves with declining retirement.</seg>
<seg id="1165">We demand immediate action.</seg>
<seg id="1166">The island - not in the State of State of the United States - suffered from a severe financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="1167">Thus, the so-called "Centre for New Economy," a ruling-independent non-profit organization without party affiliation focused on the socio-economic development, a law on citizenship, as an alternative to existing public supervision.</seg>
<seg id="1168">These are their reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1169">The economic and financial crisis Puerto Rico requires a wide restructuring of state infrastructure.</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syro-Palestinian Webdeveloper Bassel Khartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi, is missing for over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after having been arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and relatives were continuing to continue the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he has made for an open network.</seg>

<seg id="1186">Mélanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist in France resident CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara Rühling, businessleader at Book sprints, a publisher of the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective leverage (The cost of freedom: a collective reresearch).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book, which was published last year and is available here license-free, contains a number of papers that deal with free culture in face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction is it:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book would like to discuss how movements are constructed for free knowledge and what the real costs are, with whom this is connected.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designer, developers, researchers and authors, who are involved in the movements of freedom of knowledge, have been able to assist you on the fog that surrounds our Newsfeeds and to create some sense of our various experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to rid Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrating internet volunteers, who has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was painted from the folder of Adra prison, in which he sat on October 3, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then, we have no information about his current state or residence.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title Collective Memory gives his friends and family a voice that push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom.</seg>
<seg id="1196">To see how Bassel pays a high price for their participation in a free culture, many of us begin to think about their own destinates, deeds and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What have we decided?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of timeless extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital activist has been in the harbour of Syrian government authorities since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015 Bassel was born from the Adra prison, a non-military organization to an unknown place.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and Ombudsperson Noura Ghazi, told that the "Military Police Bassel had taken on the basis of a" strict secret "command from his cell in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported it was contacted on 12 November 2015 by persons who asked yourself as the insider's-Assad and took note of an inned death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">To be a common place and condition remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in finding access to the Internet and knowledge to the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a Designer, Technologist and at the moment's access to the manager of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Basler's cultural prototypes present was the work that he began with a group of Archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to construct the ancient ruins Palmyras virtual.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archeological sites of the world, was the roadmap of numerous civilizations and here merges Greek-Roman architectural types with hiesions traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Bassa couldn't know that ten years after having started working with this work the IS would have to put all this architecture that embodied not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This strip in the digital archaeology and conservation has created a time-capsule, which will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel this project could not yet close.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my whole life with it, of freedom to dream and bassel instructed me to embrace it.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call on his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel brought me English for me, even when he was already in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read English well, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with each one who has asked. he has taught other incarcertained, English, to write and speak.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassa opened the gate to the technology. he taught me both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He has also brought other incarnations as they use computers, at least theoretically without that they actually held a place in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (waiting), a block, which she wrote in the years 2012 until 2015, when he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura have worked for a year together on the book.</seg>
<seg id="1223">They scrupulled the lyrics to him, when they visited him and he translated them out of the Arabic in English.</seg>
<seg id="1224">The book is free-free.</seg>
<seg id="1225">Booking of Youssef Abdalki.</seg>
<seg id="1226">The book is devoted to public domain.</seg>
<seg id="1227">Here is an excerpt from the book of Nora with the title "It happens."</seg>
<seg id="1228">It is done every time you visit,</seg>
<seg id="1229">That I fail in the world of your enchanting eyes,</seg>
<seg id="1230">That I lose the creature at the moment in which we embrace,</seg>
<seg id="1231">That each of the dangers no matter</seg>
<seg id="1232">Each of the fences, bondage and watchman</seg>
<seg id="1233">I forget the throng of prison</seg>
<seg id="1234">And I dringe upon every detail of your voice and words</seg>
<seg id="1235">Which I trage with passion for me</seg>
<seg id="1236">When your eyes say,</seg>
<seg id="1237">And I will let another piece of my soul with you...</seg>
<seg id="1238">I honestly back to my loneliness,</seg>
<seg id="1239">To regain all the moments,</seg>
<seg id="1240">And to cry over your absence and smile.</seg>
<seg id="1241">I exaggerate myself that I will return soon...</seg>
<seg id="1242">At the first anniversary of the detention of Bassel wrote Ghazi:</seg>
<seg id="1243">A year passes, my soul</seg>
<seg id="1244">During and during</seg>
<seg id="1245">I am in your cage,</seg>
<seg id="1246">And you still are in the cage of monsters</seg>
<seg id="1247">History is not unique in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Since the beginning of the protests of 2011 against the regime of Bashar al-Assad, according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights (Syrian Network on Human Rights) has gone more than 65,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="1249">Those who were arrested or defiled under violence by the regime, were tortured or even executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">From 2011 to 2016, according to the international human rights organisation Amnesty International at least 17.723 Syrer in Haft died.</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many other people are unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1252">The Global Voices community for 2012 has been calling for the release of Bassel.</seg>
<seg id="1253">We repeat our demand in the hope that we have to do so for the last time.</seg>
<seg id="1254">Mosambique: because of corruption cranked director to prison quarters, return to previous post</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mosambicans reacted with anger over a corrupt, in which a government member returned after half of his sentence in the workplace that the corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This was Diodino Cambaza, arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment in 2010 with four other defendants (around 800 000 Euro) to 22 years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money tribted from public funds of the airports of Mozambique, the Council of Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 because of good guidance and immediately requested his re-setting in the company, which happened on April 19, then.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with an opinion of the prosecutor prosecution of the Republic, who would have the request, there would be no obstacles ground for Cambaza to return to its old post as the company removed to his prison.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many citizens do not wish the action good.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Center for Public integrity (Centro de Integridade pública, shortly CIP), a local institution committed to public transparency, condemned into an interview with Deutsche Welle the decision of the company to remark the director:</seg>
<seg id="1262">The absence of transparency in the fight against corruption and clarifies the lack of transparency and is even a backstage with regard to the efforts of our legal system, so the CIP.</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we need to take note is that the company should have applied as an exproprietary proceedings against the resellers.</seg>
<seg id="1264">However, the company apparently suggests and prompted no proper legal steps to apply the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">"" "Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the mosambitious social media, borrowed this behaviour as well as regards the case as" "" "resistance" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1266">When Cambaza would be a competent type, he would be adviser after having been sentenced to a sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could keep paid lectures and motivating speeches, he might give advice and his image polishing.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since it is incompetent, he has been honoured into being reintegrated into the company that he helped to cause damage.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore, it is obvious: Cambaza will be happy to pay for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Resistance!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mosambicans and Student der Political Science in Brazil says, the director gives no moral:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza was rewarded by the state because he revived him, I cannot believe that someone was rewarded with such a way that has already validated the state as massive.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza is missing the morality and serve the state, * he had already a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead it has only served by the state itself.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as a hand it became an inexhaustible money source and the state itself, this man has become weary, the pre-loaded and finally condemned to a long adhesion.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly speaking, I don't know why this man was rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey Zeúte preferred it, the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel to remember that a thief belongs to the prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Dioxins belong to the prison Samora Machel, the Mozambians will not only be remembered as the first independent president, but also as a sharp, catchy, and - next to said - prophetic speakers.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous oral portrayals was, when he was energetic, that "a ambitious man is capable of being able to sell the fatherland for its ambitions, his own individual interest, to sell."</seg>
<seg id="1279">Samora also said, "I don't know if an ambitious man changes, my experience shows that the tactics but it does not alter its ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="1280">An ambitious human being is at the same time criminally. "</seg>
<seg id="1281">In Twitter the reactions were also disappointing:</seg>
<seg id="1282">Cambaza was sentenced to 22 years in prison, he sat on 10 years and was free.</seg>
<seg id="1283">And today he puts him in charge of the company with which he funds untreaded, resume under contract. # AssimVaiOMeuPais - яца.htm (@ azmal _ Rafik) 12 May 2017</seg>
<seg id="1284">Emildo Sambo from the magazine @ Verdade (to dt.: @ Truth) establishes that crime in Mozambique is paying:</seg>

<seg id="1286">Facebook blocks the racist word "Kalar" in Myanmar and censored many users to injustice</seg>
<seg id="1287">The burmesan word "Kalar PAE" means casted or antiquity.</seg>
<seg id="1288">Photo of Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unnamed</seg>
<seg id="1289">According to the information from Facebook-users in Myanmar, the known Social Network took their Posts from the net, because she did the word "Kalar."</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although the origin of the word is still being discussed, it is normally used to refer to people from the indian origin or in general as adjective "Indically."</seg>
<seg id="1291">Facebook zensiert the word "Kalar" or take hold of it (in Burmeric script) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of the assassination in Burma during the social network.</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely decrease.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word which mostly used by Ultra-nationalists as an obstacle to Muslims, which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to fight, assassination in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of sensual content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'may normally be associated with racism, but the word itself does not automatically calls hate speech.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that even Posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubts concerning his use of usage, censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Moreover, there are several warmesan words with the different meanings that have the same character as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, chair is written on Burmese also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words as' Kalar PAE '(Spartage),' Kalar oat '(camel) or'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The FacebooknUser Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was deleted today because he enthused the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However he was wondered his friends on our spiritual kind, whether she watches it, how he could relieve his back pain by having a vocabulary.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The proposition ku la - "healing" (ku) + the rodent (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression very, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win heck is the opinion that they will reduce Hasslanguage radically nationalists, but also pointed out that Facebook analytical his feet, before it disseminate all the indemons occurring in suspicion, racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook löetes the word "Kalar" not manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filtering the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automaticallmatism is not understood what you can write on facets.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What to do it instead is to analyse the post office carefully and control it by checking the adjacent words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar PAE" (alternating).</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good is that these three-story nationalists will spread a rather good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to crop their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to everyone to disseminate the language, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experience of social networks in China like Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that the censorship of keywords often will start a cat and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks are simply going to use a new word or an alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook started to delete his Posts when he wanted to tell his friends just that the word 'Kalar' has banned from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I was aware of this new directive of Facebook, I made a post to share my Facebook friends that is locked in word.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post office has been removed from Facebook and I was prohibited the light, post and sharing of content for 24 hours, because the post office "said the Facebook community standards."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of Posts from people who have no negative intentions or simply try to show their opinions against the Hassing radikaler nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, which has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without Hassspeech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author told his opinion on why extremism nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have more to do before the beginning of the initiative, for example the Burmese internet community for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook likes a benevolent purpose to reduce racism in Burma through their platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Such words to be censored will only bring more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">In addition, it seems as if they have started without a local context or technical support, and as words as "chair" or "inherited curry."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they have made mistakes, they tried to correct the falsely resolved Posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they would have only slightly more respect for the 15 million benefit they had a great deal of turnover, that would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Illustrated automatic toensorship has taken care of a lot of spam under users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users now take on Facebook funny and write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of salvation language to see if their Posts are taken from the net.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook-Posts which were not uncovered, but nevertheless removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmese text reads, "I want to sit on a chair and watch an Indian film and watch an Indian film.</seg>
<seg id="1332">Only to try out if Facebook lies the mail that contains the word Kalar. "</seg>
<seg id="1333">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1334">"" "the post surveying" "" "If you are a doctor, do you heal people?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In the past five years extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists have used social networking to extend their votes and their influence.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, envelope in social networks shall in addition to their communities in Myanmar with in addition, specially in the area Rakhine where disputes between Muslims and Buddhists have been forced to escape.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook has been criticized for his failure to convened the benefitative hassing on his burmesan sites under control, criticized.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But instead of simply the word "Kalar" to censively, it would have better ongoing, rather on context rather than on code focused initiatives and learned of them.</seg>

<seg id="1345">Prior to this change of spouse, some members held Hinduous and Muslim religious communities, and in May 2016, brother Harrypersad Maharaj, the leader of interreligious organization (IRO), a group, representatives of the various religious groups of the country gathered for the state to not intermingle the maturity.

<seg id="1346">"" "" "" "this happened regardless of the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contractual partner of the UN" "" "Child Care Convention," "", "the minors as well, every person under the age of 18" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1347">Statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the proportion of children that were married at 15 already in Trinidad and Tobago 2.8 percent, and with 18 were 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011 the statistical central office of the country confirmed that between 1997-2007 more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys were married in 19.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online-petitions and social-media movements that endeavors to create legislation on children's toe, followed at the foot and do great support. without doubt they helped to bring this outcome.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nevertheless no everything went smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">A Hindu leader, Z. B. had no concerns to say the critics of the children's toe, they should look after their own affairs. "</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition usually issued for tensions in this actually uncomplicated thing, and sometime soon came to whether the opposition would ever agree to the legislative procedure.</seg>
<seg id="1353">Yet at the beginning of 2017 the draft law was decided against the children's toe - despite 4 senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent, that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority share it for the law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the President of the country has to agree with the law.</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the senators of the country gave us a Status update, which has posted Leslie-Ann Boiselle on Instagram:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the draft law against the children's toe was decided in the House of Representatives with 35 votes for it and not only decided on it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">After having done before in the Senate, the draft can now become the law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of the Social-Media-User had been enthralled because the laws of childbirth were finally changed.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook-member Lovell Francis, who held a ministerial ministry in the Ministry of Education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It has too much time and unnecessary swellings used to quit the core of the thing, but do you know what? the children's e is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago now illegal, and this is nearly worth every price.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel Jackson the opinion was, it was definitely long enough to finish the practice, Lara Quentrall-Thomas exaggerated that the day was finally arrived:</seg>
<seg id="1362">Public Status update on Facebook of Lara Quentrall- Thomas, which beses:,, Herzoraging news!</seg>

<seg id="1365">Folding Mutota, who belong to the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil society group that said quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was, noted:</seg>
<seg id="1366">The local age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of the religious group of 18 years.</seg>
<seg id="1367">The draft to modification of the current network was adopted today, on 9 June 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1368">In the House of Representatives, there are 41 members and of which were present in the voting rights.</seg>

<seg id="1375">But a possible hook comes in the shape of sat Maharaja, therefore, the Secretary-General of the Sanèdharma Maha Sabha, the most famous Hindu organization of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1376">Months ago Maharaja has proclaimed his intention to undertake the court-oriented steps, the law should be passed and he seems to have his promises.</seg>
<seg id="1377">During the general contractor Paris Al rawi, a disagreement of the law, said, it was entirely lawful, if Maharaja against the law would move, the most social media users would go differently from the issue.</seg>

<seg id="1380">Or do you think it is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">However, whether it comes to a judicial approach against the law or not, these legislation is an important step - however, there are still places in the world where children's toe are legal or continue to the norm although there are laws that they tell.</seg>

<seg id="1390">Through the spies of web pages, Turkish users can view Wikipedia-contents</seg>
<seg id="1391">The English-language Wikipedia page was presented on 18 January 2012, opposing the SOPA (stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright laws in the US, internationally updated.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Written by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For over a month now Turkey has released the popular and crowdsourcing principle-based enzyclopedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day by day becomes evident, how important the platform for users is to find helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students as well as reporters and fans of TV-series crank against the rejection.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many technologized internet users are used to use polling tools for blocking websites (an up-to-date article from the New York Times reported that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence of the world), the most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has posted articles from Wikipedia since 2008, as recently published in a published report by Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, find regular blockages on the Internet since 2007, after the Internet Act (No. 5651) was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">To China, Turkey is the most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform continues to be locked, there are now several mirrorsides (pages, which reflect the contents of Wikipedia and frequently updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform leads all Turkish Wikipedia pages on the decentralized peer-to-peer network (so machine computers) which does not base itself on the system of domain names and thus making a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is available in spite of lawful prohibition.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post, IPFS tells about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">Once we have heard the news (about the blockage of Wikipedia) we put everything in mind, snapshots of Wikipedia on the IPFS platform. thus, the possibility to read the content on decentralized and distributed in ways.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to get at least all Wikipedia content even if you cannot achieve the website www.wikipedia.org.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS was also given that this step was done independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is merely a screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the web page.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to handle the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansiklopedi.org, a Mirrorpage of Wikipedia, as well as Wikimirrors, an open source project that everyone can use to host similar characteristics, if in the respective country Wikipedia is blocked.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices member and staff at Mozilla in Panigrahi's Open Speaks to Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy server, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">One accesses on a different URL that is not the original one is. that what can be seen then is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Essentially the server directs the request to the right Wikipedia page, so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia even if they are blocked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">For this is executed by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was with the photos, which he looked around, never satisfied. they were blurry with poorly position motifs and mature colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">The motivate him to bear a camera with yourself and try to commit the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar, Neptune strives to bring Neptune to the international scene at the age of 28.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his homeland right next to the Chitwan National Park, offering him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that guide the attention to Nepali animal world.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how he helps him with his first-class position in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could it be better for a passionate wildlife photographers!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested at home when I suddenly Navarre (the manager of Chitwan Gaida Lodge). he had received a call from my Father, that on the banks of the Rapti river would be a leopard.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is just a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately, I got on with my camera and was in a few minutes there.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father had watched him and showed me the place on the other river side, where the leopard was up and I immediately began to crush pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar seeks co-operation with the authorities to achieve global recognition for Neptune and wants to deepen the understanding of how wild animals are not so terrible, as they may look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know, for he was tigers already face to face to face:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger can not interfere with the opinion of the sheep in sleeping!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also I was standing by the darkness on the way home, when suddenly the king of the Buharks appeared. he immediately sat down, we see ourselves and he died through the Sal-trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar the logo "I click for Conservation" (lit.: I clicked on environmental protection) on his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">However, his passion for the encouragement of Nepali nature and wild animals is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days long, and mostly lived in a tent to make up the Bardia National Park recording of Ottern. up to 12 days it lasted until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds who live near the tourist tax.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This entry was composed by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and was originally published on Video Volunteers, an award-winning media organization from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was published here as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India there are women with great care to address the name of their wives, or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">"" "instead, they use a pronoun or say" "" "father of my child." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh give women to respect her husband's social pressure, as well as fear of the consequences they should be misinformed this practice on life.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year Malati Mahatoto was condemned out of the Indian State Odisha by a hypozcourt and chased by her family and the village community, after having addressed a halted relative with name.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of her spouse also does not call upon their names, is also common among men. however, they have much less to fear, if at all, they should not escape this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, appeared nine women, including health care as well as homework, a unique club and were therefore quickly the main topic of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place for them alone where they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states, he is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, which is operated by the Community Video Volunteers and campaigning for the dismantling of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Pahas been working with the help of its videocamera for seven years with the aid of practices, such as children's marriage until the exile of HIV- and AIDS-infected parties, and guides these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">She reports about how this club have created a safe place for these women and at the same time they have made the ambassador of the change at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video, the Rohini showed in its discussions, acted by women who did not name their wives.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She decided on this issue because she wanted to open the conversation about Patriarchate with a problem that women can easily identify with.</seg>
<seg id="1483">In fact, the name of her husband did not speak out loud is a broker that they maintain all the fee-guilty and never asked questions.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini believes:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman is respected her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who did not keep it, is treated as a sly, as a woman without morals.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband before the name, at home, how it works.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion with her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband was tempted for a long time after the video was at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said, I was asking him from now on by his name.</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in the luggage, she started their first discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "Patriarchate" has never heard before. some believed that it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the videoprojection the women examined the discussion with a exercise in motion.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked each participant in the name of her husband with various emotions - happy, annoyed, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then she asked them all, "If we cannot tell the name of our husband, but they can call us how they want it means that they do not respect us?</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it be not equal? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when she brought the name of her husband over the lips," says Rohini Pawas out of the village of Walhe in Maharashtra over the break of a centuries-old tradition, in which married women could never intervened the name of her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so timid that she decided during the whole exercise just before themselves; one another decided to go out the whole tremulated frustration against him and his family by cursed him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ekstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Still in adrenalin rush along with an ancient bricks to have broken down the women that they would actually try to name her husband to name their name.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they held their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days, Rohini received a multitude of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas they put in the head: his wife could not cease to tell his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it during the dinner prior to the entire family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law she died, she was afraid and said that there was an error.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Another woman said, "Rohini said, I was doing it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understandably and the situation nodete in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Raw materials reported as women have tried to stop other practices, such as the wearing of the zinnoberred dots on the forehead, which indicates the spouse:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband that I would bear the zinnoberRed Point even if he also acts.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I heard to bear it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not completely listened to them, but they think they are now in a better position, even to vote in some days not to bear.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange views and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "we make a trip on each discussion club." ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go beyond the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">I don't want to worry that women could make sure what could hear, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1522">In recent months she celebrates her own birthdays with cakes; they danced and sangen and spoke about things that they had never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I also have some things, for example as our identities to our wife, never so honest spoken.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to say certain things out loud, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion, we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have had only Saris since their Saviour.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most is the okay, but some wanted a salty-cta, a wide shirt over a pants that they have not dressed.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After a lot of dispute and discussion of the advantages of their own clothes-selection, morality is connected to the Saris and much more, shmute Rohini her own couple of Kurta (Oberhemden) in a discussion section so that the women could wear them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they now decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can carry jeans and raw materials is certain that they will manage it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question of whether in the five months since their first discussion club has already been altered, the Rohini confirms that things are slowly coming into roles:</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have only done small steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women probiased it a few times but heard then again on the name of her husband to say.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, make it yet, but only if they are alone and no other family members are there.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husband; only one or two women bear now at any time in Zinnoberred on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the fender to lie more freedom of movement or in their own closets - at the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">As they give each other self-confidence, they will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How the Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am also it.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each one of us confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that there is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction if every woman is going home in the club and other people about what we are talking about and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We are all sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1544">The correspondents of the video Volunteers community are coming from marginalized groups in India and make videos about stories about which will not be reported.</seg>

<seg id="1630">In 2009 Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for "Subversion" (state endangering), after being involved in the draft of the charter 08, a manifesto that contributed the democratic reforms in China.</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid since Singapore is recognized as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister-Minister K. Shangre, Singapore should be considered as a town.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has triggered a debate in the blogosphere debate.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting, during the meeting of the meeting of the International Zweigs of the Association New York, the Minister that many people argue the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because it is compared with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supported that Singapore should be seen as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... nobody asked if New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "the Blog Cavalierio described the Minister of Justice," "" "twisting the logic" "" "to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, according to all our efforts and sacrifices to create this valuable land, we can say that we ultimately be no country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded as vulgar, it had the semblance of a flight before the responsibilities.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, Whose land is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons listed by Shangre were not very noble: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal lands, in view of its, he appeared to inevitably undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In contrast, he defends the idea that Singapore with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York should be compared to equally cities that are permanently removed from a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Once you reach the core point of the topic, the good old lyre has been reached from authoritarian rulers, leaving the twisted logic, as they adapt better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end of the year, the answers to his American guests were given to his American guests with respect to our press, our Judikative, our political system really no response.</seg>
<seg id="1703">Appropriate questions tarnte he with non-responses will be rationale.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng has prompted Shangre to see his opinion, because they did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to read.</seg>
<seg id="1706">When Singapore is not a country, but a city is, thus to which country belongs to our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">Short, I understand nothing.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our werter K Shangre would take on the effort to clarify this point unless he was paid very much to be part of the Government of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By clicking on the blog, he pointed out about the reviews that one should begin to read the entire review of the conference so that you can better understand the context of the statements of Shangre to better understand, according to which Singapore is a city and no country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said, Singapore is rather a" "" "city" "" "as a country" "", "stated why the elections in Singapore were so unequal, even if we are looking forward free and fair elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He played Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party to win a party?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said, Singapore" "" "is not a country" "", "he obviously does not have it in this sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shangrgam, which makes a leader of a growing generation, such a polemical statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am over what the Minister of Justice in Singapore said, very embarrassed...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard, which expects me - may I disagree with them or not, but this is another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shangrgam, a member of the new generation of political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure whether he really believes that he is truly aware of what he defends.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The Temasek Review submitted the weak points of Shangrgams argumenters:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"" "has Mr Shangrgam" "" "gooder a mistake" "" "or was it a freudscher speakers?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, we will only be regarded as independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, to which country go back the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">As he plays an important role within the government of the interior, the statements of Mr. Shangre are of serious importance.</seg>

<seg id="1740">Your answers are published here as part of a continuing series, with the rumors of certain parts of the world, and another facet should be shown.</seg>
<seg id="1741">The latest part of this series originates from Nevis Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1742">The question which is posed to me in Japan is: "are you American?"</seg>

<seg id="1746">For someone who does not know, there is little that the Canadians differs from Americans.</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians get a Canadian banner only visible at its backpack whenever they travel.</seg>
<seg id="1748">All love Kanadier.</seg>
<seg id="1749">Americans on the other hand....</seg>
<seg id="1750">So it was even when I began 20 years ago to travel through the world - before Donald Trump, before the march in Iraq and September 11th.</seg>
<seg id="1751">Canadians have always worn small Ahornets at their luggage to differ from their american neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="1752">We have a free health care!</seg>
<seg id="1753">For us there is no weapons!</seg>
<seg id="1754">Gender equality in Canada have already been legal since 2005!</seg>

<seg id="1759">We are not like these types south of the border.</seg>
<seg id="1760">We Kanadier are nice.</seg>
<seg id="1761">I hate this.</seg>
<seg id="1762">First, I have many American friends I admired.</seg>
<seg id="1763">There would be nothing if you would like to confuse me for example with Johnny from Dallas.</seg>
<seg id="1764">With Marc from Austin.</seg>
<seg id="1765">With Adam from San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Or with Michael from Honolulu.</seg>
<seg id="1767">But there are also some problems with the stamps "nice."</seg>
<seg id="1768">First, referred to as "nice," said, basically, like the google, gentle, but tragically, unimportant figure of Flanders from "The Simpson" (who has a own Canadian Doppelgänger).</seg>
<seg id="1769">If Canada would really be a nation full of people like NED Flanders, this would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem is that "nice" no personality has.</seg>
<seg id="1770">There are no corners and edges, nothing where you can encounter.</seg>
<seg id="1771">Harmless to be inconspicuous and ininteresting and not to earn attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">This can be something good if you want to remain unnoticed in the background, far away from the things that pass around one.</seg>
<seg id="1773">I would even go far as far as to say that the desire to be free and alone, a main building of the Canadian.</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to take care of our own affairs only.</seg>
<seg id="1775">What outsiders as "nice," is perhaps just cool politeness.</seg>
<seg id="1776">Canadians are not often talking about the fence.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Us lacks the warm, open friendliness that I have now binding with my American friends.</seg>
<seg id="1778">Luckily for us (and for the rest of the world) then Justin Trudeau entered the stage to show that Canadians are more than just "nice." our prime minister has made Canada almost sexy.</seg>

<seg id="1780">One in Thailand famous Pop-Band has released a music video which was parodized the Junta and restoring the civil government in spite of its promises, the country continues to rule the country.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phadet Girl) the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells them which rules make him his girlfriend.</seg>
<seg id="1782">Although not specifically political, the music video refers directly to the lasting military rule of the Junta.</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and others for their courage to describe the situation of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video of the song was a great success.</seg>
<seg id="1785">In the first three days alone, it was shared on Facebook uploaded video 1.254 and received 8.800 lkes.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Last month it was even blocked the Charlie-Chaplin video "The dictator" in Thailand after a group of activists stripped to watch this video.</seg>
<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to the Thai policy as it behaves with the situation of the country under the Junta rule.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Look at once again these shots of the videos that are related to some of the political issues that Thailand have been prosecuted in the past three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">The "44 rules of girls" refers to the drained part 44 of the provisional constitution, which grants the Oberbeech, absolute decision-making authority over important national issues.</seg>
<seg id="1790">The 11 rule: "changed your attitude" refers to the degenerated program for "insertion change" by journalists, students, scientists, activists, politicians and other individuals who are viewed by the junta as critics.</seg>
<seg id="1791">The image above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime, whose vage and unclear rules are often used by the authorities in order to disregard activists and other critics of the state.</seg>
<seg id="1792">For this purpose a new unit set up in the army has also been supervised by the online content and those who discarded, the monarchy is persecuted, criminal prosecuted.</seg>

<seg id="1796">One of the problems that the Junta continues to follow, their decision is expensive submarine boats, although security sexes they warned that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1797">In the video even shown how people are thrown into a black storing device before going into an Internifier, another problem.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Some journalists are in prison, because they allegedly caused "confusion" in society and will cause internet ususers long arrests, they should occupy the monarchy.</seg>

<seg id="1902">It is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. however, they know a lot under the name of Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitian that are on the passage.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordina Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talk about the rights of LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and opposition</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was recorded by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib forgets the majority of his time drindoors; sometimes he sourced to his canvas, sometimes to his computer, and again to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what can be abandoned, is a cigarette between its fingers or its plotene hidden lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the top floor of his family house, which had been in front of them since 1967; the year, in which Israel completed his occupation of the Westbank, and Hdaibs family forced to flee from their village in Palestine in which she had lived as felahyeen (about: Farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years Hdaib is a passionate activist who stands on the conservative majority and questioned its old opinions about gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and Rapmusic.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, often faced with topics like orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, but also calls for the core of the whole Arab world. all these topics do not only find in his native city of Amman Relevance but also in cities that suffice from Damascus in Syria to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With its 25 years Hdaib sees itself as someone who is not restricted in his mind by limits and he can feel according to their own statement with the people who have suffered among the devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he does not open it openly, he defeated a special diversion against American foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib regards his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe his compassion for those who try to survive in war-areas, something that is to do with his identity as "Palestinian refugees" - so he is born himself, even though he was born in Jordan, and has never been in Palestine until now.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"" "" "" "I don't think because of my own living conditions so" "" "stresses Hdaib." ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">Then it adds: "I think that because I am a man," while in water I am burnt down to two cups. it is the Holy month of Ramadan; at that time it is intended for Muslims, from sunrise to sunset.</seg>
<seg id="2105">The jordal law also declares that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee on a sensed hot Junitag has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Generally speaking the messenger of hot coffee and the facades of the cent cigarette in the nose is first and foremost by freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky, especially when you have a look into the neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">It therefore makes it easy to do basic things - as to drink basic things - as to drink in public during Ramadan water - to land not in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Republic of Jordan has had a performance of the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some of the parliament, supporting the Islamic action of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of homosexual frontsant Hamed Sinno, reflect the cultural and traditional norms of the country and be the main reason for the concert tabs.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The members and former press spokesperson of the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that had said the concert "just" because of the sexual orientation of the Sangers.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many pretations that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world may be dangerous activism that constitutes the old legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the entire region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">"" "in a public statement, Mashrou's Mashrou'Leila is the" "" "progressive supporters of human rights" "", "which continue to use itself" "" "for intellectual and cultural pluralism." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement is likely to be simply not simply the rhetoric rhetoric but actually reflects an increasingly clear reality in Jordan that occurs in Hdaibs work clearly.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In the year 2016 Hdaib traditional sex-like to Leibe, having formed his vision of the fate of Arab women who have vorehelichen to have sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of a apparently endangered-known woman whose arms and legs are standing up to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red sea; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who actually should trust them.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In the past years, the number of "Honorary Sede" has increased in Jordan - the inofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Human Rights Watch according to the amount of Honorary Citizens in 2016 got their culmination; however, the Jordan had missing the institutional infrastructure to support women who have been victims of murder or domestic violence to support proper way.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law on breaking control from 1954, women who are exposed to danger in prison, "to uncertain time in prison," and for its release is often a long-bureaucratic burden as well as the guarantee by the family is needed that the woman is nothing to happen.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaibs music has enjoyed great popularity and is known for it, also not before heading to scruffy, which is in his country long as tabu gold.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib argued that his work is political, however, that he is his music, who is full of exponotes on sexuality, freedom and expression is not able to separate from politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I komm from the Near, man.</seg>
<seg id="2125">I became a policy of politics, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="2126">"" "in a song called" "" "Edward Sa'ed" "" "the question of the Palestinian identity in attack." ""</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lavla al 3aib" and in "Ghareeb" the focus is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs which are political, can be recorded in the core.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib published a song with the title "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated many times:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and any other one is also."</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market on which one can get in his words, "that can be" - be it faith or non-faith, Hetero- or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that barely any one speaks in Jordan on the rights of gay and lesbians and that comments on equality of LGBTQ + individuals were largely censored in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">2014 Hdaib led an interview for the popular jordanic online program Roya, in order to remember that his comments were indemolished from the context, and his opinion were censored.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"" "" "" "on Youtube, it has been uploaded without cuts, but only one edited version" "", "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today Hdaib is open to the Arab LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance towards homosexuals do not speak to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, who has remained in memory today thanks to its homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks itself: if Abu Nuanything that should work later on behalf of the potassium, in the eighth century I could write openly about homosexuality, why can Jordan do this?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">"" "" "" "in the Haschary Kingdom there is nothing new that the government attacks attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are brought about silence." ""</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian message service picked up several former government members and members of the teacher, with the rationale, they had expressed themselves on comments in social media critical about the problems caused by deep in the country-rooting corruption.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of what is the concert of Hdaibs, according to that, only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jordan river.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan has denied Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - so sieht es Hdaib - consists of slow, oppressor and inner changes. it is certain that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the ordinary society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Lastly, Hdaib, though, as millions of other Arabs, also, of an Arab world without interventions in foreign countries.</seg>
<seg id="2145">"" "he not only dreamy his work as to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to experience" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region is through music, art and literature of genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, Streumunitions and on artificial kinds of lawful democracies. at least he hopes that.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until that time, Hdaib will continue to pass, and therefore shall also provide resistance.</seg>

<seg id="2150">These large, extravagant war lips are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Nebuta festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">One suspected that it is a variant of Tanabata festival, which is usually practiced in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory came over that the festivities and dancing over more than one thousand years have been delivered in the northeast to force the Indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emishi, to force the knee.</seg>

<seg id="2170">At the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, the appearance, appearance and thus also the fancy hairstyles of famous sportsmen like Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led to getting more of normality in the experienced hands of hairdressers that can reproduce these consuming hairstyles.</seg>

<seg id="2181">The following article is the edited version of the article's "Loving Shoes" that released the international online-Magazin Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write only love letters to people who we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not yet much more important, people who feel prepared to accommodate affection?</seg>
<seg id="2185">Exactly this question went to the two young Colombian activists by the Stiftung BogotArt and Cristian Palacios from the Young-Youth-Stiftung no longer out of the head and inspired it to the campaign Cartas por la Reconciliación (letters to reconciliation), who write young people to write guerrilla letters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently, its country's location of an historical event and they wanted to contribute their part. after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had concluded a peace agreement with the GuerillaMovement FARC (German: revolutionary forces of Colombia), which forms the final point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">International was considered to sign the sign of peace, so important that the Colombian President José Manuel Santos was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.</seg>
<seg id="2188">"" "" "" "however, in front of the Colombianco, it is still a long way to talk about real reconciliation and peace." ""</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla fighters that lived for many years in illegal bearings, were exposed to a military rhetoric, and all around the clock have carried out their weapons in their lives, they have to be incorporated into the life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society in turn, who has accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases a deep hatred against Guerillakerern, it must now take in their ranks and assist them in building a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombian people had to join and help in integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And this is exactly what they did: up to now, thousands of young people wrote letters of letters - love-message to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back in the company.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign are 6900 letters - one for each former Guerrilla fighters - who will then be handed over to personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the letters to reconciliation was created on the world summit of the Nobel Peace Prize which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there were Leonardo and Cristian the possibility to speak briefly with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.</seg>
<seg id="2196">"" "" "" "this explained that we love the people who we love, at Valentine's thousands of love letters, but those forget that they need much more need." ""</seg>
<seg id="2197">He tarpaulin, he continued to share his love with people this year that needed most pressing.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Thus the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of FARC, who will now find their place in society and to build up a new life. "the letters will show that the Colombian company is ready to make the discourse of a war history to a common history of peace."</seg>
<seg id="2199">So far in the framework of the campaign were collected more than 2000 letters.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i had never imagined that someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were passed on 19 March in one of the UN camp in the Caldono region.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students of the University Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city administration of Cali and Leonardo from the Foundation BogotArt bursts in the camp to transfer the letters personally.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC presented themselves how they had done it earlier to take the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they received no orders, but letters full of underuse of people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for all involved. "it's incredible how many different feelings can walk in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that lies between," told the politicians of Manuela Jiménez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a assistant of the governors of the province of Valle del Cauca described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After we had handed over the letters, a former fighter led me through the camp of Guerilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">"" "when I saw in one of the" Cambuches "" "" (a kind of hut, in which the Guerillakshocks live), I saw a Guerrilla fighters that wrote something. "" "</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go down, because next to him on the bed was a MGL shell Lace, a deadly weapon in the Dornbirthing sheep.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "and said," "" "Hello, what do they do?" "" "I replied," "" "I responded to a letter that someone has written me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Never my life has never written me something so beautiful, that is why I suddenly responded to it. "I suddenly delivered the tears over the cheeks.</seg>
<seg id="2214">I embraced him completely and set me next to the Granatcher.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was tired too, was sorry to be all the years of faithful companions of this fighter and wanted to help him to write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never had anything else from life than war. he who had to join the FARC, was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers before the famine. "I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society there waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now I learned only how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"" "but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">To the prelude, students and some leaders of the FARC came together to a discussion section.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war and conquered the FARC already in the secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">Therefore, the leaders of the FARC, the history of the organization, its ideals and gave insight into their views about the peace process: "many years have experienced, how we have the possibility to develop ourselves to a political party, we can help to create society in this land.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "for a target of this size, it is worth to overcome all obstacles," "" "said one of them." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed with:</seg>
<seg id="2226">These people have never heard heard so far and had no choice, and to realize that people who often saw as monster and even hate even people with beautiful feelings are turned by their livelings and their environment was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives, does me sore.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforted me that all men - also those who killed and so much damage to us can bring us something and give a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo González, the Commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, he wrote for example Darío de Jesús, the Archbishop of the City of Cali, the following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombianchi was argued that after the drains of peace would rule.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as there are inequality, hunger and lack of education, health and employment possibilities, there will always be people who are ready to access weapons and protesting their rights. and that is entirely justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We of the FARC now rely on peace, to a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">Therefore, we call all defenders of peace - regardless of which race, religion or ideology they belong to confession - to rise above all of the states that are dreamed from a country in the war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and bring victims, because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. those among us who defend the life as the basis of existence will impose many difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2265">I knew the person not.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I just know that there was a young man, no 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost the consciousness and the wounded final end in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently, some women had everything to get and started scream.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man had fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital I learned, that I had two stitches in my right lungs.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in what ambulance has been laid - in the men or the women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are outdated, there is still my male name drauf; but the doctor rose and put me to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very grateful for this.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time at his brush, I got it to do with the fear; it was a Muslim, a cold name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good man.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him that he is respectful of me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than one month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I got threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote me - Related, strangers, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">This was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The required to return to Chechnya to prove that all that was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They asked absurd demands: some told me, I am proof of it by going up without the streets of the city, others that I did not change in the official TV in Grosny and tell that I was not having sex, that everything was only bad, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have any body size C - what should I say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this print?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it is still hard for her.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older people spoke to me my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">They said to her, "You have brought a monster to the world that not only has your family, but the entire Republic of hurt.</seg>
<seg id="2290">We cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you will have to disappear from here. "</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother was too much and she placed a strick around the neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbors and delivered them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved into an apartment and a few hours later under the window a car with broken window plates and a numeric sign with a 95 dron.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Once it happened for the third time, it was clear to me that there was something lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My violations of human rights verified the numbers of numbers - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you fled?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons I do not want to give their names, but I will say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With her help I left the country, but then something was something unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought it without registration, without a reference, without everything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and cast it into the rubbish.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checkup in the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">In the moment I wanted to call my mother per WhatsApp, I got a message: "you don't think about, you're in security, just because you have left the country?</seg>

<seg id="2312">This was actually my cell number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in touch with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"" "" "" "however, we are not talking about the genital equalisation, but this is a tabby theme." ""</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditionally kaucasic elements are still in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">So much I wish it, this seelic barrier can I not overcome.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I am always saying that, as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to hurt them.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera, I am indeed trying to watch the person how the person recalls from her past - thus in my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What are your friends, those who have stayed here?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I have received a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For the term I needed up to date information on the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I spoke to someone who has received a half months in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that during Ramadan no people were arrested and tortured but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not lock a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"" "" "" "as I mean, they probably invite relatives to take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end the so-called" "" "honor" "" "experienced through blood." ""</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are now being arrested even more vasted men in this secrecy?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a well known picture of mine says, there would be just not so many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, then especially those who have no abundant relatives or were left by their relatives to make Kadyrows Court.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are held there so that they can present them later as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">"" "say," "" "should they be redone, you will show their body on TV and claim they could have attacked either a village or a military base." ""</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply gone, but specifically submerged to radial themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this now only a mutation or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just got someone who had a half months in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in the prison after their beard grew.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new since them.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They just have taken them away.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was himself taken when these people were taken.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now, they were not presented as bandits, so far there were no reports. we suppose that such actions are quite possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else could you not have this man to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and deductions of people, which belong to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation, already in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always had my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think, before 2003 I was already familiar to Grosny when I lived there - and I never had problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In the Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when the Scharia was considered, I had never had problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, at that time it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">Russia originally intended to bring us back to the "civilisation" but ultimately brought us back to the brioneage.</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were conflicted; I had filtered eyelashes, contributed Röhrjeans and short Tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The security ministry of the sharia has never violated me only a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In front of the Russian theatre in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially at weekends, a whole group of people met like me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small square where several benches were standing, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why people met young people, there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a reverence: Kharda ma Kharda. that means: "Spotte is not about the unhappiness of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">You often say it to children when those who make themselves funny.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they simply have their eyes locked in front of you because they believed, you are sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never offended me, never hunted and never smitten.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long was this Gnome time?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long to Kadyrow on the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Minister of Prime Minister, he began to speak on TV on morality.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He did not speak about us per se, but primarily on the behavior of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - one could feel like the people in the city started to change.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Whoever had scaffold and laughed, see you at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In the period I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home, I could feel how the situation in the Republic has ever been wasted.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you proceed now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't compose much - 700 to 800 dollar per month are not much in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that I am still working as an activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of Psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organize teacreffs, assemble, I assist you to hospital and help them to get Essences.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I have no penny for this.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself than I dispose of fluent.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslims and I want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you enter a Hiddenab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: this is albern.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So nature is pure; it has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Chechnya, who want to do with bowls in front of the mouth, that there is no coils with them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestans have who, the cabardiner, who have the Russians also; on the entire planet there are - but not in Chechnya. "</seg>
<seg id="2386">I am from there, so it is annoying to hear sowas.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet here so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go into the mosque and during the Ramadan - live with men together.</seg>
<seg id="2389">Know, many think of transition to men who love men and they believe that you're thinking to make more intimate experiences. but that's a trust.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different types of sensation to be accurate, different ways of life.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important to feel me in my own skin and not ashamed for my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not, if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry that I will be so personally here, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not sad for this - I just know that I am now myself.</seg>

<seg id="2435">The following article is an updated version of the opinion written by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on the website Afroféminas. the article was the subject of several discussions where many different positions have expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments under the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">If I say that I am not feminist, many women - especially white females, who call themselves as an interctional feminists - with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">You wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even thought well, scientific and societal arguments before me, why I should be feminist and why we should be all feminist * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, women today still earn less money despite the same formation as men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under stringent observation, when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their body.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social standards still ensure that women sooner or later meet in different areas of life on a glass ceiling, and that discrimination based on the sex is still moving across the many different countries and faiths.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is aware and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced of it and I leigh double and triple.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet, when I come to speak on skin colour, on black women in LGBT people, on black women in LGBT church or on black women from the Diaspora; when I speak, on which way we are challenged, both in and outside of feminist movement, to mention many white feminists and white intermeager feminists.</seg>
<seg id="2448">But nevertheless all women are saying that women - all women - to come together to "their voices, and 'Kumbaya, my master' to sing 'to achieve equality (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they do not want to talk about that, in addition to sexualised violence provoked a institutionalized form of racial violence, that we are exposed to black women on two-fold species.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or about that black women and women of other ethnic and origin of origin less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girl and girls were referred to as a migration background of the school as a white girl, due to apparent integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black spheres of women and women are exposed to a higher risk to suffer the domestic violence and violence in partnership, as white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want all the women, all the men and all humans have no skin colour in all the same rights; on the other hand, I can not observe myself as a black woman, in whose center the white woman is to consider, injustice into their mind that relate to the gender as well as to the skin-color of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I'm exhausted and will no longer fight for my belonging in a white-feminist cofist, which still rejected me and countless other black women and always rejected.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sojourner were complained in 1851 in her speech: "I am not a woman?" and also I refuse to uphold an ideology, in which the black woman in historic respects is a human and marginalised being.</seg>

<seg id="2459">I pulling it off to release me full and completely from feminism that was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman, instead of working for a white-feminist paradigm, which is so stubborn that Interfactional is celebrated as a new phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it's more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and set ourselves into the spheres of spheres, which are created by us for us.</seg>

<seg id="2462">Although some white and interfactional feminists are immediately called separatism and exclusion after they have read these lines, please get to inform yourself about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement from which the black woman is concerned.</seg>

<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 advertisements on domestic violence at the food courts. there were also 86% of the ads of women.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the ads they said 40% of women that they were physically walking, 55% of women were talking about psychic abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">But these statistics show not the true scale of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the paraguan Women's Minister Ana Baiardi, only a few of these criminal offences are actually shown. "on every woman who reimbursed in Paraguay because of psychic abuse, 9 women who do not do this.</seg>
<seg id="2498">On every woman who reimbursed because of physical Missions, two women, who do not do this, "explained it at the end of 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since women's suicide in Paraguay has no own offence existed, the prosecution authorities may not adequately documented how many women are murdered by their current or former partners each year.</seg>
<seg id="2500">In August 2016, journalists told at least 12 cases of women's murder in the country alone until August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator of human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>

<seg id="2505">Before Mariana Brítez has been the firm girlfriend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that they told him the names of all their former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">At the beginning it did not want to actually, but gave them to. this should be for ever bereuen.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today Mariana 28 years old and no longer coincided with Carlos. but two years, she bore the psychological violence in turn - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time recognizable the most severe recognizable:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought that I would have been victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">If I have read earlier than that, I always thought that only women are going to be obsworthy, because they deceive themselves from violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that I would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana uses social media to report about the abuse through Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without name, she wrote posts on Facebook where she described its insults and various attacks during their two-year relationship and told how he had isolated it.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetoric whether he ever asked the hand against them and to stand up that his behaviour also was a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana, why she had fallen in so long from Carlos and had not left him before.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as wanted to say that victims of abuse at least a certain co-blame.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos that did not originate from Paraguay, fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner she slapped her.</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the network Yo te creo ("I believe you") that consist of women who are all in some way victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">You do so many others do not: you take the information of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias Fall everything began with psychic distraction.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her wealthy partner finally managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he started to strike it.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victorias ads with the authorities continued without a result and also of their relatives, she received no support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">She introduced a process against her former partners who developed into an unbeatable legal struggle between Paraguay and their home country in which it was mainly about money, power and influence of their former partner.</seg>
<seg id="2525">Paraguay's laws: good approach, deficient implementation</seg>
<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good but not to be applied.</seg>

<seg id="2528">Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN-Organization for Women in Paraguay, looks also great problems in applying the laws in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016, a bill was discussed in the paraguayan Parliament under the hashtag # PorEllas (# Fürsten).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the movement # NiimaMenos (# non-Less) are part of a campaign on Twitter, which is supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original accusation of the law foresees, Femicid has to be able to explain and tougher on his own offence and harder to punish as it is already in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Thus the legislator has changed in some points to also win members of the law they feared that this is the way for decriminalisation of abortions, which are currently prohibited in Paraguay and can be punished with up to five years in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original bill was envisaged by the bulk of the (bureaucratic and economical) of process that have to bear the victims of violence at present themselves, if they just have to refund a secure place to erect the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argues that the law is not effective if the lawmakers do not provide sufficient funds for it:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, abuse is seen as part of interpersonal relations.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Here a change must take place so violence is no longer considered a normality.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Whoever conflicated in view of these facts makes himself nocent and contributes to the perpetrators of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2538">We have to refund such a long display until abuse is no longer considered normal.</seg>
<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the Act in the paraguayan Senate. previously, parts of the law had been altered though, among other things, a passage underlined that the partners in cases of domestic violence called for reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The opinions about the changes are to be taken apart.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warriors 2016 in Zambia, picture takes place with his consent</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media or not mentioned at all. this is an increasing area that addresses the most pressing needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">For the need to be performed on-site medical research there are two reasons: for a lack of global health, many medicines and vaccines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria are far more widespread in the poorest countries in Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investments for exploring these diseases through pharmaceuticals are a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Second, research that is carried out by African scientists who develop their own research capacity in Africa. a greater role for science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warriors ist Director of the centrist at the Center for the research of infectious diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew in Lusaka in Lusaka, Zambia, especially when the AIDS epidemic effect showed first serious impact on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, first at Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he searched for himself on HIV virus, before he decided to go back home to support the sambian health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warriors discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstanding of the media on these research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(disclaimer: Dr. Warrior speaks as an individual).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrior RW: at the moment the focus of my work on the application of research results. I support the sambian national program for Antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Furthermore, I just died a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">GV: what are your opinion of the important current trends in your country and generally in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research. we only implement solutions that have been developed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This must change, otherwise we will always remain receivers instead of being creators.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions we get, are often not suitable in our surroundings, and sometimes it is impossible to use it here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">GV: where does the finance and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are very well funded.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to come back or want to come here because finance and development opportunities are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">GV: how is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">Which obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not had?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries. it cost much money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GV: how is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there are already interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GV: how large is your opinion the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should they concentrate on and how can we support development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students from all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is need of special scientific training, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The social sciences, computer sciences, big data, research of the Cosmonty, the Health Service (non-transferable and contagious diseases) and efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GV: can you describe the pros and cons of Life as a scientist in Africa towards Western countries, based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often, there are the limited speed, things to do, and the scarce access to scientific expertise, which represent challenges here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system that journals will make available articles only against payment (the so called "Paywall"), also limited the amount of availability and speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the US to India: how to change "Open Source" seed producers into global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This contribution from Rachel Cernansky originally appeared on the site Ensia.com, a magazine that reports on solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton breds already in the USA for the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 sorts, such as Outredgeous, the first plant that is cultivated and consumed by NASA-Astronaut in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years Morton work was only determined by its own ingenuity and the question how many salaries could get.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But the beginning of the 2000s, he noted that increasingly more salads were patented and that he could not use it on the breeder.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents go not only for individual varieties, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green or curved leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">In recent years, more and more such patents have been filed on more and more plants like grain or card places. because of these trends, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts provide food security for food security for the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia ancient tradition, Morton is still salad, however, it does not need any longer, since its work is increasing more and more constraints than ever.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"it is, than would lie in a river a rock, to which I have to pumped.</seg>
<seg id="2637">"" "so we have to do this now, but it is a fraction of the breeding-tradition," "" "says he." "" "I think that these patents go on salads." ""</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stick to judgment, no one can breed any more of a new salary, because all the characteristics are already patented. "he is doing so well as possible and tried to curate the characteristics he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, he is very careful and striving to use no material which is protected as being intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He is also connected to a movement that is becoming ever greater in the US and all over the world: Open Source Breeding ("Open Source" breeder).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International ISS station ISS awarded red redmersalat of the Sorte Outredgeous in the "greenhouse" of the station bred and eaten, there will be tested whether plants can be grown in space.</seg>

<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like it would be the movement from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for "Open-Source" -Saatgut) can be inspired by the movement for free "Open Source" software that provides alternatives to copyright-protected software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was called into being to ensure that some plant species and -gens are not protected as intellectual property and are permanently usable for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, named Ossi, shortly Ossi, he can commit to the breeder that others may be able to use them freely.</seg>
<seg id="2647">This does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and they can sell them. "Open Source" breeder do not allow others to breed their seed, and it will not immediately expose themselves - two aspects that are prohibited by many plant patente respectively.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeder and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Scaffold views</seg>
<seg id="2650">Professor of the University of Wisconsin Madison and Ossi-Management Board Jack Kloppenburg are monitoring over the seeds and the ability to grow new plants, both important for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seeds also plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over the dietary system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter or only little by employing seeds with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg emphasises that the "Open-Source" movement did not work with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not. "who wants to purchase our goal of ecological sustainability, such as for example on farm markets, should also know that the way for example is bred on farm markets, should also know that the way this vegetable is bred is threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">Nutritive sovereignty without seeds of seeds is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to providing others to the seed they will continue to provide you with action in contrast, to patent seeds and plant-characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi-supporters argued that the future of food supplies is at risk, since the available genocide due to always numerous acquitted intellectual property rights on plant material, which is thus always limited to unshrinkable.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, Executive of the Ossi, has been engaged in her PhD with genetic variation with carrots and their availability. it found out that about one third of all Kartotteness is protected as being intellectual property, making it not only usable for plant breeder.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants there are not such estimates yet, but experts like Luby suspect that mass-juice cultivated plants like wheat in even a large style are patented as salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are so bred that they are targeting targeted characteristics - from such, through which their tastes or their color can be improved until such, due to which they thrive in certain environments, and threats such as vermin or sickness or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patches on plant characteristics point out that the available plant material for breeder thanks to more and more patents. genetic diversity are currently unnecessary than ever since the changing conditions are worse predictable due to climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto-Specherin Carly Scaduto indicate that genetic diversity is generally important and also decisive for Monsantos activities. with a total of four Genths and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture, the Company for the conservation of genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">You contradicts the opinion that intellectual property promote other breeders, since "patents and the protection of plant variability to promote innovation." a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow, once the patent is expired.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to get to the same result with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Thus, such protection does not inhibit innovations, but promotes them by making the public more material and know-how. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees the differently: 20 years to wait for a patent expired, which certainly does not produce innovation.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have been waiting for such a long way to cultivate plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, the fight could have lost already.</seg>
<seg id="2669">The main argument to Morton is, however, that genetic resources have always been a general good and it should continue to remain: "independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such formalities, and monary incentives are not attractive for us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "this is what drives us and it will be impossible if we continue to use the best and newest genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">"" "altogether, Morton is upset on the concept of itself, plant-characteristics:" "" "we create the features not really." ""</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form them out and as a breeders, at least we have no idea how the plants do this.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeding-in in the US-state Oregon and Ossi-board member, there is still another important aspect of plant breeding: "who is bred a variety, bred also his own values into them.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Whoever believes in industrial agriculture with large courtyards and monocultes, for their cultivation we need Herbizide, bred in his varieties of this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "my concept is exactly" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (such that move to international markets but smaller than for example Monsanto are patents, create it the most smaller seed companies, even without patents to survive - either reject it, or keep it for too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton looks for in his Zuchtgarten Salads.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton is also the view that breeder by the Avoid of plant patentators are innovative: "it looks like I am with my efforts to produce new, stronger than companies, the patent.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I constantly need new material for my catalogue, since I know that my competitor will sell my sorts in a couple of years, "says he." with a patent you are protected from competition for 20 years ago, with which you think it is quite simple to make. "worldwide resonance</seg>
<seg id="2683">Although the US seem to be a leader in the "Open Source" cattering, the concept is now broadcasted rapidly all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Agriculture") that works itself as a professional organization in the area of resources, an "Open-Source" seed programme. for the preservation of the seed plant and helps them to grow new varieties that meet specific requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them to come to "Open Source" seed and to sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">The German organisation Agrecol works on an "Open-Source" license which ultimately requires a formal and legally binding form of the Ossi obligation for breeder in the European Union.</seg>

<seg id="2721">Still, the Egyptian authorities do not still lock the contents on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it hit the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a columnisten.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend around the 05.august, the Egyptian government has documented the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documented human rights abuses in Egypt and the Arab world and reported on that.</seg>
<seg id="2724">August published the network a position on facebook, in which it has criticized the Egyptian authorities for this step, and spoke to continue the work and efforts of human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remain bt- despite this attack and the Constitution of the Egyptian Law and the Constitution. even though it has never been so difficult to pursue these goals, so it was never so important as it now. ANHRI have never been so important to overcome these objectives and not to meditate on. we insist to fulfill our task further.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is regarded as the first censored website of a human rights organization in Egypt, after the authorities' linked more than two months 21 websites, such as e.g. the independent news of MADA Masr, arabic-speaking edition of Huffington Post, and that from Qatar stamatic network of Al Jazeera, because of the "support of terrorism."</seg>

<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photo journalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity, after he was arrested by the Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while he picked up a video as the police bodily violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His article mainly revolves around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment by the Ziada to the rejection by the government and reflected what this means:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The fact, blogs to block is very old, however, has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi number; and even if the rejection of the blog may not be significant for the world, so it is for two reasons:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It succeeded in convey to me the feeling of an insulting state; An imprisonment, a betray murder, a reference to the National Security Council, the rejection of blogs as well as any other web page, for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proven that I was not in other words: my words have no influence, even if only on a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First I used it to the post of articles to get the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">However, after they have blocked him and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
