this is James R@@ isen .
they know him perhaps because he won as a New York Times Rep@@ or@@ ter the Pul@@ itzer Prize .
long before any one had heard of Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen a book , in which he was spectacular , that the NS@@ A are illegal teleph@@ ones from Americans .
but it is a different chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence service , which passed the CIA to Iran , literally to an atomic bom@@ b .
if the crazy sounds , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who the chapters do not know ?
the U.S. government .
for almost 10 years the government has been established against cr@@ acks and asked him to call its inn@@ ed sources .
in this turn , he became a symbol for the pattern of the government , wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower to condemn and poss@@ essed journalists .
according to the first constitutional data , the media has the right to release the secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right , when media cannot receive this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the cour@@ ageous , which they do .
so as the government at mi@@ ce anchor , he did something that many cour@@ ageous re@@ por@@ ters have already done before him : he ref@@ used , and said that he would rather go into prison .
so from 2007 to 2015 , along with the risk to go to the prison .
but then , only days before the process , was something exceptional .
suddenly , even though they have been given for years that it would be essential to their case , the demands of the government were falling down .
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring the re@@ por@@ ter and springs can always hide less .
instead of fail@@ ing and taking into account , this could also take its digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators have been concerned , without his permission , his telephone was secret ,
just as his email data , financial and banking information , its credit card , and even travel agate with the list of its flights .
in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Ster@@ ling , a CIA wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower and ris@@ ens source .
unfortunately , this is only one of many cases .
President Obama spoke with his approach to protect wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lowers . but instead , the judi@@ ciary has condem@@ ned more than all US governments before him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem especially because the government has too much from their work as a secret .
since September 11 , almost every article about national security was the result of a wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower to a journalist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we therefore set the press work on the game , which should be protected by the first constitutional data , because the government has ever more options to pi@@ ping all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but just as technology of the government allowed to handle the rights of re@@ por@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources .
and indeed , they can take this from the moment in which they contact , rather than in retro@@ sp@@ ect , being in the witness .
today there are communication software , which had not yet been written than rec@@ essed his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or telephone calls .
such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open @-@ source super@@ vis@@ ing system for wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lowers , which was originally developed by the Internet @-@ famous which has been developed by us against Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , and is today developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation , where I have been developing , further developed .
instead of sending a e @-@ mail , go to an news page , such as the Washington Post .
there you can upload documents or send information such as using any ordinary contact form .
this will then be encrypted and stored on a server to which only the individual message agency has access .
so , the government cannot proc@@ ure any more information secre@@ tly , and many of the information they would call for would not be available from advance .
Sec@@ ure@@ drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century .
unfortunately governments all over the world are developing new sp@@ y technologies that je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed to all of us .
it is in us to ensure that not only technology vis@@ as like Edward Snow@@ den have a possibility to express mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lowers .
the over mis@@ use in the care of soldiers want to en@@ vy and report by overwhel@@ med hospitals . or the next environmental workers , the alarm is defe@@ ated by F@@ lin@@ t . or a Wall@@ street in@@ sider which war@@ ns us before the next financial crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , these technologies were not only committed to those who want to exp@@ ose crimes but to protect our &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; constitutional &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 , the largest Dat@@ l@@ ery of the story published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; had hidden that empi@@ res and mighty &#93; &#91; we &#93; have hidden Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness around a statement . &#93; this week we have received from messages about a l@@ ery of 11 million documents of the law firm Mos@@ o Fon@@ sec@@ a .
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax hav@@ ens .
we get an impression of how customers , banks and Lawyers to companies such as Mos@@ o Fon@@ sec@@ a go and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you create it ? &quot;
we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages as the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to the first very direct consequences .
Iceland Prime Minister has returned .
also , there are reports that a prohi@@ bit of the brut@@ al Syrian dict@@ ators B@@ asch@@ ar al @-@ Assad has off@@ spring in tax hav@@ ens .
it is said that a trace of 2 billion US dollars has led to Russian President Vladimir Putin , over a narrow friend of children &apos;s days , one of the most famous C@@ elli@@ sts .
now there will be a lot of rich people and others who are nervous about the next release , and the next enth@@ used documents .
now this sounds like the p@@ lot of an agent or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham @-@ Romans .
it seems we@@ pt away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should we approach what ?
but the truth is : if the rich and mighty are able to hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens and not all pay their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and that affects all of us .
for my organisation , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenomen@@ al .
all over the world discuss media and leading politicians , such as the secret tax hav@@ ens are used by some few to hide and wear , -- something that we have been discussing and coll@@ ar for ten years .
I think many people this whole world seems very conf@@ using , and it is difficult to understand how these tax hav@@ ens work .
I imagine it always like a mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so one has a company in another company , in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible , truly to understand who is behind these enco@@ dings .
it can be very difficult for prosec@@ ution and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what matters is .
I find it also interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA .
pres@@ um@@ ably because there were so far no prominent Americans recorded in these revel@@ ations , that sc@@ andal .
now it &apos;s not so that there are no abundant Americans who hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens .
but by the principle after which these tax hav@@ ens work , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers .
could we have a dat@@ l@@ ery from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would have much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA .
in fact , it is so that in some U.S. states less information needs less information to found less information to found a company than a library of a library .
this kind of in@@ difference in the US has allowed the employee of school circul@@ ating to hide school children .
it has been contrac@@ tor allowed to des@@ per@@ ish , particularly an@@ due fe@@ eder .
it is this kind of behavior that affects all of us .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice .
how does that actually work ?
thus , we sent a co@@ vert investig@@ ators in the offices of 13 firms in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ators gave himself as African Minister , who wanted to bring money into the USA to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
we really sho@@ cked that everyone had suggestions to an Adv@@ oc@@ ate our investig@@ ator suggestions how he could transfer his money .
these were all pre@@ disposition . none of these law@@ yers took us as clients , and of course nobody was handed over to the money . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important to consider this not as an individual case .
it is not about an individual attorney , who has been sending proposals backed by our own investig@@ ators .
it is not about a single top pole , implic@@ ated in a sc@@ andal .
it is about how the system works , through the corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability .
and to cope with this , we must change the rules of the game .
we must change the rules to make this kind of behavior .
this may sound quite comfor@@ ting as if we could do nothing about it ; as if nothing could have changed , as if there is always the rich and mighty .
but as a new@@ born optim@@ ist I really see that some things began to change .
over the past few years we have seen violations of more transparency , which concerns the owners of companies .
the subject found political attention from British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
since then , the EU is captured in central regi@@ sters at the national level , who really is behind companies in Europe , and who controls them .
one of the unpleasant facts is that the United States lag@@ ging behind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; representatives of both parties have brought a draft law in both parliament@@ arians , but this does not make the progress we would like to see . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we would really like to see how these Panama revel@@ ations , this huge insight into the world of tax hav@@ ens , used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind proj@@ ected their true identity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need executives in the economy , which stand up and say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ transparent is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we need leading politicians who realize the problem and use it to quit these kind of transparency .
together we can finally stop the In@@ transparent , which now ends this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing , finally end .
this is the story , as I was almost kid@@ n@@ apped and in the trunk of a red beast that would be yellow .
one day after I finished my design studies , I made a back@@ yard .
a guy in the red ma@@ zet remained and looked like my stuff .
he bought one of my works .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip through whole country . afterwards he would go to the peac@@ cor@@ ps .
I invited him on a beer . he told me about how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where do you find it ton@@ ight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he made the whole thing worse , &quot; I do not know it yet . &quot;
and I thought , &quot; Oh , man !
what m@@ ach I now ? &quot;
who does the situation not know ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just got to know him just before ! he says he would go to the peace of peace , but I don &apos;t know if he is really planning . I will not kid@@ n@@ apped in the trunk of a Maz@@ ow@@ land !
this is a small trunk !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard that saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have a bu@@ ff . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; how to ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at night I was in bed , I star@@ red on the ceiling and thought , &quot; Oh Mann ! what have I buried there ?
a wild@@ ran@@ s@@ sleeps in my living room .
what if he is crazy ? &quot;
I got such a fear that I got out of bed , on to@@ e tips to the door , and my dormitory @-@ door closed .
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in contact .
the artwork that he had bought from me still depends in his class@@ room . he is now teachers .
this was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my perspective .
maybe people who were sold to me in childhood as stran@@ gers , actually friends who are only waiting to be discovered ?
to face people on my air mat@@ rat@@ ze was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco I took the bu@@ mat@@ rat@@ ze .
take a stroll , two years later ...
I am un@@ employed , almost pl@@ ast@@ ness , my ro@@ omm@@ ate moves out and the rent is increased .
I attended that at the time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can create it , fear in fun .
I wrote my best friend and new co @-@ omm@@ ate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I talked about how to make something about it . our apartment will accommodate a designer Bed and Breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk , including a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a site and set up so &quot; air rat@@ ors and breakfast &quot; &#91; AIR@@ Bed a@@ N@@ d Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three lucky guests were allowed to sleep up for 20 dollars on the air conditioning on wood flooring .
they found it super , and we too .
I am sure our cheese @-@ ham @-@ O@@ mel@@ et nar@@ row@@ ed completely different because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them through the whole city . when we passed our last guest and passed the door into the castle , star@@ red Brian and I sat down .
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rental rental ?
the things came in roles .
my former ro@@ omm@@ ate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czyk , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if you could make a business concept .
thus , we presented to the investors : &quot; we want to create a site , on the people publicly pictures of their private rooms post , their bedrooms , their b@@ aker -- the kind of rooms , whose doors are closing when you visit us .
through the Internet , they can then invite those foreign people to stay with them .
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we wa@@ ited that the ro@@ cket would ign@@ ite .
indeed , they do not .
nobody who still is at con@@ sol@@ ation would invest in a business that allows stran@@ gers to sleep in homes of other people .
why ?
because we as children all lear@@ nt that stran@@ gers are dangerous .
when you have a problem , one spoke to the things that can be good . we could dis@@ agree .
at the Kunst@@ akademie , we had learned that design is much more than just appearance and tou@@ ching -- it is the overall experience .
we had learned how to design objects but now we wanted to create trust in design immense trust , between people who had never met .
can design make such a thing ?
is it possible to create with design confidence ?
I would like to give you a sample of what degree we trust .
it is a 30 @-@ seconds experiment . it will force you out of your comfort .
thum@@ bs up , when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I would like to susp@@ end your mobile phone .
enter your left cell phone in your left seats .
this silent tou@@ ching of panic , which you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they opening the door first .
for the only one that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to hold the cell@@ ular phone of a stran@@ ger in his hands ?
most are the responsibility .
so most of the guests feel when they spend elsewhere .
that is why our company can exist .
only time so , who now has Al Go@@ res mobile ?
could you pro@@ claim on Twitter that he en@@ coding for the office of the President ?
you can now return the mobile phones now .
you now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I want to tell you of some disco@@ veries .
what if we have changed a little detail in this experiment ?
what if your neigh@@ bor could have imag@@ ined once with his name ; if he would have told where his dog or his children ?
imagine you would have 150 maps that all say : &quot; he can really cap@@ tiv@@ ated mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel then if you would have to leave your mobile phone ?
because a well @-@ conceived feedback system strength@@ ens the confidence decisive .
at the beginning we did some things wrong .
it was hard for the people to leave negative credit cards .
in the end we decided to wait until both host and guest had given their assess@@ ments before we set it online .
last week we have discovered something new .
we have carried out a study with Stan@@ ford , as most probably it is that people trust each other , depending on how similar they are regarding age and place of residence .
little surprisingly , we trust the people most that are most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less confidence we rely .
this is a natural social default .
cap@@ tiv@@ ating it will be if you add the call of a person -- in our case by Be@@ ur@@ departments .
if you have less than three assess@@ ments , nothing will change .
but it has more than ten , changes all .
a good reputation sti@@ ff@@ ness out .
so the right design can thus help us overcome some of our deep ro@@ oted preference .
furthermore , we learned that confidence depends on how much you get there .
here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you tell too little about how to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you will not get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tell me how , for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request is also rather not accepted .
so there is an optimal degree of openness , e.g. &quot; tol@@ le artwork in your apartment ! I do with my family vacation . &quot;
how can we create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics you should write something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our whole company builds on hope that the right design can help us to overcome our pre@@ judi@@ ces against stran@@ gers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we did not reck@@ on was the great amount of men who were more than willing to put these pre@@ judi@@ ces .
here you can see how many people take advantage of our offer .
you can see three things .
firstly : incredibly good luck .
second , the ti@@ reless work of our team .
thir@@ dly , a need , which had not been covered before .
for us the business is just very good .
of course there are times when not everything is smoothly running .
there were guests who have un@@ allowed part@@ ys celebrated or apartments sl@@ ated .
hosts have guests in the rain stand .
at the beginning of the project I worked with the customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the front front , when trust was broken .
there is nothing worse than this calls . it does hurt , if I just think about it .
the disappointment that one hear in the voice of the inv@@ a@@ ers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve ourselves .
fortunately , from 123 million sold nights only a fraction of the fraction had ever encountered a problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for people trusted other people rightly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when trust works , can thereby create miracle .
one of our guests took vacation in Uruguay . there he learned a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even ended blood for the necessary operation !
here is his evaluation :
&quot; perfect house for travelers who are due to se@@ ated actions to heart attack .
the area is beautiful and equipped with plenty of hospitals .
Javier and Al@@ ej@@ andra are real Guardian Angel , who can save the life , even though they do not know one at all .
you drive one in their own car to the hospital , when you die , and wait , while you get a b@@ yp@@ ass .
because they don &apos;t want to feel lon@@ ely , they bring books over .
you can even stay longer without having the extra @-@ nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
of course , of course , does not run every stay .
but these relations behind the pure money action are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
when I first asked about this concept I asked myself :
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions together ?
it is here an economic trade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is now just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the thing is not justified . &quot; &quot; &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people lay a part of itself open and that changes everything .
if you travel today is that with fast food compared . it is efficient and reliable , but it is less authentic .
what if traveling would be a rich buffet from local impressions ?
what if at each place we visited , a group there would be waiting to fill out a thoroughly complete and to show one to a pub tour in the neighborhood of which one has never heard before ;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star cook ?
nowadays apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would like to shape apartments from the ground up to sitting ?
how would that look like ?
what if cities would accept the thoughts from the common part ?
I imagine cities which enable us to help society and relations instead of lon@@ eliness and dow@@ ning .
in the Korean capital Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking places that the government belonged to
were now offered acc@@ ents . students who were looking for a ben@@ ds ,
were sent to people whose children were educated . there were In@@ cu@@ b@@ ator@@ program started ,
to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . through our platform alone , night 7@@ 85 000 people will be guests in 191 countries as a guest in a foreign or even host .
the idea seems to be not as crazy as it was brought to us .
we did not re@@ inv@@ ented the wheel .
hospitality was also previously mentioned .
there have been a similar site before us .
why so why did our work ?
apart from happiness and timing we think you can find the right design with the components of confidence .
design can help us overcome deep @-@ minded pre@@ judi@@ ces .
I find this aston@@ ishing ,
almost to be overwhelming .
I have to think about every time when a red ma@@ est@@ ead goes past me .
we know of course that design cannot solve any problem .
but if it could help us if it had such a major influence , I wonder why we can use this design soon .
thanks .
what do you think when looking at me ?
a belie@@ ver ? an Expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed , a bra@@ ins under@@ wear , a terrorist ?
or simply a delay in the safety slope at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I do not give you blame for your negative impressions .
so the media people represent that look like me .
one study began that 80 % of the coverage about Islam and Muslims is neg@@ atively .
studies show : the Americans mean , most would not know Muslims .
probably the people do not speak with their drivers .
for those who have never met a Muslim : it &apos;s great to meet you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee party -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a Mö@@ ven@@ eg@@ ern @-@ Fitness @-@ Fan@@ ati@@ ker@@ in ,
and I am an practic@@ ing , spiritual Muslims min .
but not like Lady G@@ aga sing@@ ings , because , Baby , I was not born so .
I decided to do this .
when I was 17 years old , I met the decision to ou@@ ting me .
no , not as hom@@ os@@ ex@@ ual people , like some of my friends , but as Muslim min . I decided to wear the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head@@ rest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my femin@@ ist friends were hor@@ ri@@ fied : &quot; why are you oppressed you yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Lus@@ tige was that at that time it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , and on the pressure I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old , to deal with a perfect and Un@@ touch@@ able beauty ideal .
I have not only accepted the faith in my parents .
I have it to the Kor@@ an .
I read him , thought , asked , asked in question , des@@ per@@ ate and credi@@ ble ultimately .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was confidence and slow dedication , which deep@@ ened themselves with every reading of the Quran .
the beauty of rhythm brings me sometimes to tears .
I know myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
did you ever feel that someone you percei@@ ves you fully understands it , and yet somehow I love ?
this is how it feels like .
later I married and began , like all the good Egyptians , my career as a engineering .
I had later , after my marriage , a child , and living basically the &quot; Egyptian American dream . &quot;
then the hor@@ ri@@ ble morning came in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
I sat in my kitchen , had served at the end , looked on the screen and saw the word &quot; ether . &quot;
there was smoke and air@@ planes flo@@ cks in buildings , people sp@@ out of buildings .
what was it ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock turned into being quickly in rebel@@ lion .
why should you do something like that ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I changed the television channels and heard : &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terrorists &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bom@@ b Mek@@ ka ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oh , my God .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not only attacked my country but in the N@@ u turned me the actions of others from a civil society into a susp@@ ects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the same day we had to travel through the Middle East of the United States in order to move into a new city and start studying the construction activity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I remember the way I drove me -- so deeply there went to my seat , and I was afraid to be known as Muslim min .
we moved this night into our apartment , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then heard , saw and read the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organisations that said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be vig@@ il@@ ant &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bal@@ ances in well illumin@@ ated areas , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; temp@@ ts not &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed inside the whole week .
then it was Friday in that week -- the day that Muslims gather for prayer .
and again the war@@ nings : &quot; does not go on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot;
I saw an extensive coverage .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ fil@@ tered and I also heard from attacks on Muslims or by people who held for Muslims , in the midst , and cutting himself .
there were really mar@@ gins at mos@@ ques .
I thought , we should stay at home .
but something felt not right .
because the people who had attacked this land , our country had attacked .
I have shi@@ fted the anger of the people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to make sure to explain .
I have nothing to questions , I love questions .
these are the acc@@ us@@ ations that are hard .
nowadays we can actually say people : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims .
when will we go on ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like from a tum@@ or in the body of the USA .
it is only the question : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tum@@ or can be seen as a whole and a ben@@ ign tum@@ or , only under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is wrong .
Muslims are like all other Americans , no tum@@ or in the body of the US but a vital organ .
thanks !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , r@@ hel@@ pers and Olympi@@ oni@@ ken .
will the closure of mos@@ ques of America will make safe ?
it may be free to release a few parking but not the terror .
the regular visit of a mosque leads people to regard other faith toler@@ ant , and to show greater citi@@ zenship .
and as the lad@@ der of the police in the region of Washington , DC recently told , people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques .
they are radic@@ alised in their cellar or in bed before a computer .
when the radic@@ alisation process has found that it begins online . as a first , the person of their community is cut off , even from their families , that the person believes that the person believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and anyone who isol@@ ate their behavior and their ideology is a tra@@ itor or of faith .
if we want to avoid radic@@ alization , we must adh@@ ere to people to go on the mosque .
some are still claim@@ ing that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group as the IS has established its brut@@ ality with the cor@@ an .
as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human being , I think we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add ourselves into their imagination if you acknowledge them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thanks !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ K@@ lux @-@ Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology on their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if you have a look at them , she does not drive what she does in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Bible &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality which they can read these things into the scrip@@ ture .
an outstanding I@@ mam told me recently an aston@@ ishing story :
a girl came to him because she counts the IS to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said , the problem was exactly the opposite . every cl@@ ergy had spoken unto them , she brought her to silence and told her that her wrath , her sense for the in@@ justice in the world , it would bring only into trouble .
there was nothing inspired by nothing and something that has given sense to its anger , it was a target for the instrum@@ ent@@ alisation through extre@@ mi@@ sts , which you talked a solution .
this ham@@ mam introduced the link to God and their church .
instead of embarrass@@ ing them for their rage , he showed their constructive ways for a real change in the world .
what they learned in the mosque , did it to join it to join the IS .
this was an insight , as the Islam@@ opho@@ bia me and my family concerns .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect every other ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour use of fear affects our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ?
a study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : when we fear , at least three things happen .
we are more likely to accept an authorized form of government , conformity and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
a study shows : if one cri@@ bes messages in which negative about Muslims has been reported , they agreed rather military attack on Muslim countries and the circum@@ c@@ ision of American Muslims .
this is not just an acc@@ u@@ aded problem .
if you are looking for when the mood against Muslims moved upwards -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the fore@@ ground of Iraq war and during two options periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Mos@@ lem terror as I expected it .
it can actually be a tool for mani@@ p@@ ulation of the public to s@@ lugg@@ ish the foundation of a free society , which has reasonable and well @-@ informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning .
we may feel it perhaps first , but the tox@@ ic air of fear sh@@ aded us all .
in the assignment of collective blame it is not just about to explain themselves .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple that lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school .
De@@ ah was a ath@@ l@@ ete .
he was talented at the dental Faculty , talented , much promise ...
his sister would say to me that he was the sweet@@ est , blessed man , whom she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was bl@@ az@@ ed and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when is of my bro@@ therhood of such a ver@@ sive young man ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just a few weeks after the visit of Suz@@ anne , her brother and his wife , her neighbour , Cra@@ ig Stephen H@@ icks , she was ass@@ ass@@ inated , just as the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an that was in the afternoon to visit . he did it in their apartment as when he posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page .
he slept eight times on De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism can not only be am@@ oral but also fat@@ al .
thus back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
are we gone on the mosque or did we remain safe at home ?
we occupy it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about that America we want to leave our children : one that would control us through fear , or one that we can freely pursue our religion .
we chose the mosque .
with our son in the child &apos;s seat we drove back , with high pressure on the mosque .
I took him out , my shoes went out , went into the prayer of prayer , and what I saw , let me stop .
the hall was rest@@ less filled .
then the I@@ mam made an announcement , it than@@ ked and called our guests , for half of the gathered were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , A@@ thei@@ rs , and non @-@ credit@@ ors who came to join us , but to join us .
at that moment I am broken .
these people were there because they had courage and compassion panic and pre@@ judi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose for the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism ?
will you be sure to proceed ?
or become one of those who mean : we are better than those .
many thanks .
thanks beautiful !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : thus D@@ alia , you seem to have taken an nerve .
but I wonder what you say that you might say that you are a TE@@ D@@ talk , a mind@@ set with depths are work , so an exception and not rule are .
what would you say to those people ?
DA@@ LIA Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , f@@ ool you not . I am totally normal .
I am not an exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual , as it is allowed .
when you look at Muslims around the world , and I did this with the biggest ever conducted study to Muslims around the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I am in no way an exception .
if people seem like an exception to rule , then the rule is usually broken ; and they are not the exception to the rule .
HW : many thanks . DA@@ LIA Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for handicraft , stands shortly before , a milli@@ ard business .
monitoring , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial drug . it is made possible in research institutions worldwide .
before air wr@@ apping into our social consciousness , a autonom@@ ous fleet of aircraft in France has built a six meter high tower in France for a six meter high tower from 1 500 goat . a couple of years ago she began to fly with rop@@ es .
through inter@@ locking aircraft high speed and acceler@@ ation at narrow spaces .
they can also build self @-@ constantly accessible structures .
they have learned to wear loads to deal with tur@@ mo@@ il and to react in general to nature laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of the potential in the autonom@@ ous fly .
so that a system is autonom@@ ous , it must know coll@@ ectively , where in the room the mobile objects are located .
in our laboratory at ETH Zurich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic Tas@@ ks .
for the present demo@@ s we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a deri@@ ving of our laboratories .
there are no external cameras .
each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in space to determine calculations on board , what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands are there at the highest ec@@ ie e . e.g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; land &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear starter ,
a leaf@@ let that tries , two comp@@ lies with a fla@@ p to beat .
like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in advance , much more efficient than hel@@ ic@@ opter in all its variations .
in contrast to most of the star@@ ters it can fluctu@@ ate , and thus has great advantages in start and landing , and is very versatile .
however there is always a reci@@ proc@@ al side .
a restriction on bl@@ ec@@ ters is that they react sensitive to turbul@@ ence such as Wind@@ ar@@ cs .
we develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the air unit no matter in which position the optimum position can be recovered and the performance by exercise can be improved .
okay .
during our research we often introduce fundamental abstract questions about the core of the matter .
such a question would be for example : what is the petty @-@ possible number of movable parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons to know the answer to such a question .
hel@@ ic@@ opter are known about as machines with a thousand movable parts , which gather together to hurt you .
several decades ago , they were able to fly remote @-@ controlled aircraft , which only had two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a tail@@ gate .
un@@ long we discovered that F@@ are with just one works .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechanical and easiest away air . it was inv@@ ented in front of the no@@ d .
it has only one movable part , a prop@@ eller ,
no law@@ ns , hinges and Quer@@ ru@@ der , no further actu@@ ators or insp@@ ectors , only a prop@@ eller .
although it is mechan@@ ically simple , happens in the interior very much so that it can fly stable and move in space .
nevertheless it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear @-@ mounted . to bring it to the f@@ ist , I have to put it right correctly .
the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood , it is accurate , if all of me look , is low , therefore I show you a video that was fil@@ med yesterday evening .
when the Mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in pleas@@ ant@@ age , this machine is here , the om@@ cou@@ ter with its eight prop@@ eller , a exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
you see that he is only symmet@@ ri@@ cally symmet@@ ri@@ cally .
that is why it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
thereby he receives the general capability ,
move in the room into all directions , no matter which direction it is fil@@ med or even as he was rotating .
naturally it is complex , mainly in the area of inter@@ active rivers of the eight prop@@ ell@@ ants .
some is imagin@@ able in models , the rest is learned right at the case .
let &apos;s look at this .
when flying machines should be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine is composed of two separate two @-@ prop@@ eller form@@ ers .
this turns into clo@@ ck@@ wise
and the other against the clo@@ ck@@ wise .
when you build them , they act like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
however , there is something wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller drop out , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can continue to fly further , even restricted .
we will now demonstrate that by doing a half airplane .
the last demonstration investigated synthetic res@@ ellers .
the large number of autonom@@ ous , coordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression .
we took commercial micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ter -- every single weighs less than one sli@@ ce of bread -- and equi@@ p them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit .
hopefully motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly secure machine as dr@@ practic@@ ing would like to be on Broadway a flying l@@ amp@@ shade .
of course , it is difficult to pre@@ di@@ ct the influence of this technology .
for types such as us is the reward in development and creation .
it serves as re@@ membran@@ ce as wonderful and magical our universe is , and that it permits creative , smart creatures , to form them in a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such solid commercial and economic potential , the icing on the cake .
many thanks .
1.3 billion years ago created in a very far distant galax@@ y two black holes each other always faster , you conver@@ ts so the mass of thir@@ sty Son@@ nen in a tenth of a tenth of a pure energy .
this short moment in@@ timi@@ d they h@@ eller than all the stars together in all galax@@ ies of the whole universe .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they do not put your energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the whole energy was placed in the space @-@ time plug @-@ in itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we first arrange the events at first time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
1.3 billion years ago was originated on Earth at the same time .
since then , the earth has seen a lot : coral , fish , plants , Sau@@ rian , people and -- God stand up with -- even the internet .
about 25 years ago a group of especially cour@@ ageous -- R@@ ai Weiss decided by MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronal@@ d Dre@@ ver of Cal@@ tech -- to look for a huge laser det@@ ector to look for gra@@ vit@@ ational cu@@ bes that arise about by col@@ li@@ ding black holes .
most they thought they were crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy gen@@ ies , so that the US National Science Foundation contributed their idea financially .
in decades of decades , construction , conception and extremely hard work built it the det@@ ector LI@@ GO : the laser inter@@ fer@@ omet@@ ric gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ observ@@ atory @-@ observ@@ atory .
during the following time , the precision of LI@@ GO could be increased considerably , as the recognition capacity considerably enhanced .
therefore it is called Advanced LI@@ GO .
at the beginning of September 2015 LI@@ GO was launched for a last test run around some smaller , stu@@ b@@ born problems .
on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the start @-@ up of the det@@ ector , the Gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two col@@ lide black holes are through the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the det@@ ector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life was emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the far@@ ewell of my to@@ d@@ ran@@ s@@ ill father .
that is why they were the fruits of my life .
all this , for what I have worked is no longer Science F@@ ic@@ tion ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ c@@ ist in black holes and their by observ@@ atories like LI@@ GO meas@@ urable signals . what are the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a cr@@ us@@ ation in the house of space and time .
at temporary the wave will stretch the space and its entire content into a direction , and into the other le@@ an@@ ings .
to illustr@@ ate , l@@ ect@@ ur@@ ers lead courses to re@@ perc@@ ep@@ tions often a properly al@@ ber@@ ty dance .
stretch and storage , stretching and storage . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves extremely weak , even ri@@ dic@@ ulous .
on 14th September , for example , each of us extends to the waves of the waves and gest@@ ation . the stretching of an average human was 10 high -@@ 21 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the LI@@ GO staff for crazy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with a five @-@ kilomet@@ re laser det@@ ector , and that is already absurd , this length would have to be exactly measured on less than a thousand miles of the radius of a nuclear nu@@ cle@@ us . this is gr@@ ot@@ es@@ k .
at the end of his classic text through engra@@ v@@ itation
Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder LI@@ GO@@ s , the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties in the construction of such det@@ ectors are enormous .
but physi@@ c@@ ist are fin@@ ically and with the support of the public , all obstacles are overcome . &quot;
Thor@@ ne released this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to LI@@ GO . Scott claims , LI@@ GO is more an ear than an eye .
I would like to explain what this means .
visible light has a wav@@ el@@ ength , which is much smaller than the things around us : facial extracts , the size of your cell@@ phones .
this is quite handy . because so you can customize a picture or a map of things by watching the light around you by several points .
for tones is that differently .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wav@@ el@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to make a picture of things that you mean a lot of things :
the face of your child approximately .
instead we listen to certain properties such as ton@@ ight and height , rhythm and volume , to close to the story behind it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now she speaks Alice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Bob dis@@ breaks it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sil@@ ly Bob &quot; .
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we cannot make easy images of objects in the universe with them .
but by considering changes in am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least available for LI@@ GO the measured frequencies in the audi@@ ble area .
so if we want to convert break@@ water into sch@@ all , we can literally speak the universe .
the gra@@ v@@ itation to lau@@ gh can give us about a lot about the coll@@ ision of two black holes , making my colleague Scott has been busy very long .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , p@@ pen simple : w@@ up@@ p !
turning the two bodies very quickly , you hear the same circ@@ us with an additional key change . this sounds like the W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u !
it is a kind of movement of motion , penet@@ rated into the wav@@ el@@ ength .
AA : on 14 September 2015 -- a date , which at least I will never forget -- heard LI@@ GO Fol@@ lowing : &#91; sur@@ ren@@ des noise &#93; J@@ em@@ and , who knows what he has to listen to he recognis@@ es this as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with each 30 @-@ fold sun mass , which is about as fast as the rods of your mix@@ er .
AA : let us know what this means .
two black holes , the dense body in space , one with a mass of 29 s@@ uns , the other with a mass of 36 s@@ uns , revol@@ ve each one hundred times per second before they col@@ lide .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know about it because we have heard it .
therein lies the permanent importance of LI@@ GO .
LI@@ GO lays a completely new way to expl@@ oration of the universe , as it was never before .
on this way we can hear the space and hear the invisible .
much in space , we can see -- practically or basically -- not visible .
a Super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why mas@@ ks stars in Super@@ nov@@ ae explo@@ de .
they are very useful . we have learned a lot about the universe .
the exciting physical processes will happen in the nu@@ cle@@ us , which lies behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and si@@ lic@@ on hidden .
we will never see through , since this op@@ ak are .
gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penet@@ rate iron , as if it would be transparent glass . I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it because the urine is hidden through his own over@@ lights .
using gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and the most important thing : I am optim@@ istic that in all things we have never seen that we have never seen before and from whom we have no idea of what we can only discover by listening to it .
in fact LI@@ GO just found in the first attempt of things that we did not expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the LI@@ GO project , says to this topic : ME : the kind of stars , the black holes , like LI@@ GO them observed , are the din@@ os@@ aur@@ s of the universe .
they are enormous , ur@@ old body of pre@@ historic times . the black holes are so much the Sau@@ ri@@ erk@@ no@@ chen for our ar@@ che@@ ological work .
LI@@ GO allows us to completely different perspectives on the events in the universe , on the formation of the stars and ultimately also on how we went out of this chaos .
AA : the challenge now exists as cour@@ ageous as possible .
thanks to LI@@ GO , we know how to build great Det@@ ectors and listen to the ru@@ st@@ ling and p@@ pen of the cosmos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and All .
for what could be more beautiful than the urine ?
now is the time of great dreams .
do you dream with us .
thanks .
a while ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for one year I would say to all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was afraid of that I was afraid . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether it was nervous about me , made me in unpleasant situations , I zw@@ ang me to say &apos; yes .
did I want to speak in the public domain ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
did I want to start playing with the sw@@ ap ?
no , no , no , but yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : exactly that to do , w@@ ov@@ or I was afraid , rec@@ ated my fear .
my fear , speeches to keep , my social fear -- Pu@@ ff , weg .
the power of one word is impressive .
&quot; yes &quot; has changed my life .
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
but there was a certain Yes , that changed my life deeply , to an un@@ expected kind . it all started with a question of my youngest .
I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Em@@ erson . and Em@@ erson , the youngest , called for un@@ explained reasons all &apos; kittens , &quot;
as if they were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; kittens , I need milk for my be@@ ak . &quot;
she asked me if I could play with her when I was just on the go . and I said , &quot; yes . &quot;
this YES was the beginning
a new way of living in my family . from there I felt like to play with them as soon as you ask me . no matter what I am doing , or where I go , I say yes -- every single time .
fast . I am not perfect , but I would remember very much .
it has a magical effect on me , on my children , to our family .
but it also has a flo@@ wer@@ ing side effect : only recently , I really got that the &apos; yes &apos; -@@ S@@ ages to play with my children my career saved .
I have a real dream@@ job .
I am author . I think these things come up to life .
great job .
no .
I am a Titan .
great job .
I cre@@ ire television . I produced television .
I make TV , in great style .
in this TV season , I am responsible for making 70 hours of program in the world .
four TV programs , 70 hours television . three to four shows are simultaneously production .
every shipment has hundreds of jobs , which did not exist .
the budget for an episode of a television station can lie between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
a new episode all nine days times four shows , so all nine days 20 million dollar television , four TV programs , three episodes , at the same time : 24 episodes : Grey &apos;s , 21 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours television ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my television series run to each other on Thursday evening .
around the world , my series run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million people .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broad@@ casts that I have created themselves , and not just produced , so still ob@@ el@@ clean . I have to find time , really silent , creative time to gather my fans around camp@@ fire and to tell my stories .
four TV shows , 70 hours television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fire that burn around the world .
do you know who does that make ?
nobody , because of this I am a titanium .
great job .
I would not like to impress you with this .
I say it , because I know what you think , when the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
I say it to you , so that all of you who work so hard if you now speak a company , a country or a class@@ room to take me seriously , so that I say not only on the computer and imagin@@ ative , and it is true , when I say , I understand that it does not get dre@@ aming at a dream job .
it &apos;s all a job , everything work , everything reality , everything blood , all per@@ spiration -- no tears .
I work a lot , tough and I love it .
when I am ver@@ ted into the work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country of nowhere .
it is , when I set troops on canvas , I found on a canvas .
as dream@@ y you have a high tone , provided a marathon .
it feels like Be@@ y@@ onc@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
it is creative , mechanical , ti@@ ring and in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ating , funny and mat@@ ern@@ al , cru@@ el and rational , cru@@ el and rational , and the best thing is the sum@@ ming .
there is such a change in me when the work is well running .
a bu@@ zz begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz stops like a bust@@ ling street , I could go for ever on her .
many people take them when I declare the sw@@ amp that I talk to writing that writing my pleasure .
do not understand me wrong , doing it .
but the sums up -- when I began working with TV production when I began to work and to work , build and working together , I discovered this thing , this sums , this energy .
the sum@@ men is more than writing .
sum@@ men is action and activity . the tot@@ als is a drug .
the tot@@ als is music . the tot@@ als is light and air .
the sums of God is the voice of God in my ear .
and if you have such a bu@@ zz , then you can not strive other than to the size .
the feeling , no different to be able than to strive for size , no matter what price .
this is called the Sum@@ mon .
or perhaps it also means a work@@ ah@@ olic .
perhaps it is called geni@@ us .
perhaps it is called ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I do not know it .
I just know that I was not afraid to fail and I just know that I love the tot@@ als .
I just want to tell you , I am a Titan , and I know that I don &apos;t want it to question .
to make a clear one : the more successful I will , the more the more embr@@ aced boundaries , the more work there , the more of the same simultaneously , the more observe me the more I write history , the more expectations there are .
the more I work to succeed , the more I must work .
and what do I say about work ?
I love job , not true ?
the land , which I create , the marathon , which I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound , the sums , the sums , the sums .
I like this sum@@ mer@@ y . I love the tot@@ als .
I need the sw@@ amp . I am the w@@ rest@@ ing .
am I just this sum@@ ming ?
and then stops the tot@@ als .
revised , over@@ exposed , exagger@@ ated , burned .
the ear stops .
now , my three daughters have used to the truth that her m@@ om is a single working institute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my m@@ um will not be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Em@@ erson says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kittens , I want to go to Sh@@ onda @-@ Land . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the children of a Tit@@ ans .
you are baby @-@ Tit@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the Sum@@ men stopped .
the sum@@ ming of the engine was mu@@ te .
I did not love my job anymore . the engine was out .
the sum@@ men did not come back .
my mar@@ vel@@ ous was broken .
I made the same things as always : the same title @-@ work , 15 hours @-@ day , did not rep@@ ent@@ ance , no rep@@ ent@@ ance , nothing deleg@@ ating , a titanium sleeps , does not give up , with all my heart , clear eyes , whatever .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no mar@@ vel@@ ous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in me was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a show @-@ Titan ,
everything was gray , I just had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
all I did .
I was the sum@@ men and the w@@ rest@@ ing was me .
so what do you do , if what you do , the work you love , suddenly twi@@ sted ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know , some may think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pit@@ ched You from the author @-@ Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know , you do , you are doing what you are doing , a ban@@ ker to be a painter , a painter , Bill Gates , and knows how to feel the sw@@ amp , when you knew the sw@@ amp already , when the sums were stops , who is man then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a titanium ?
when the song of my heart h@@ ears , I can survive in silence ?
and then I puts my &quot; southern states wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; for a question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am on the way to the outside , late and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , mag@@ st you playing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I just want to say , when two things will be aware of :
first , I have to say yes to everything and secondly , they didn &apos;t feel &quot; kittens . &quot;
it calls anyone more &quot; kittens . &quot;
when is this happened ?
I miss it when I am Titan bin and my sw@@ amp , and here everything is changing from my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , how you play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I say , &quot; yes . &quot;
there is nothing special .
we play and her sisters also encounter , we lau@@ gh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing exceptional .
but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic , in the lon@@ eliness and lack of sw@@ elling , I can do nothing except to hang out .
I am foc@@ uss@@ ed .
I am quiet .
the country , which I create , the marathon , which I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they no longer exist .
everything that exists are glu@@ ri@@ ge finger and hum@@ id shots , delicate voices , w@@ ax@@ ing and the song , in which it is to release , or whatever the girl in &quot; The ic@@ king can be rele@@ asing .
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air at this place is so short that I can barely breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me solve .
a mental door goes into and an energy ub comes in .
and that is not immediately , but it happens .
I feel it .
the sum@@ men comes slowly back .
no full volume , hardly there , it is quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there .
not the sums , but a bu@@ zz .
and now I feel like I would know a magical secret .
but let us remain at the matter .
it is love . that is all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something that we have forgotten .
the sums , working environment , the working environment , which is only the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you , who I am when I am acc@@ used with broad@@ casts and TV hours and how to function my brain , then I have forgotten what the real sums .
the sum@@ men is not a force and it is not un@@ employed .
it depends on the pleasure .
the real sum@@ men is dependent on love .
the sums of the river is the river that comes from the life of life .
the true vine is self @-@ confidence and peace .
the real sums igno@@ res the pressure of history , which is illumin@@ ating tasks , expect@@ ation and printing .
the real sums is simple and original .
the real sums of God is the voice of my ear , but perhaps I bl@@ aze me the wrong words , because from which God said to me that I am a Titan ?
it is just love .
we all need a bit more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me I will say yes .
I do this for the firm rule , so that I can free myself as a work@@ ah@@ olic of any fault .
it is law , I have no choice . I have no choice if I want to hear the sw@@ amp again .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in games , I don &apos;t like it .
play is not always in front of me as they work .
the truth does hurt ,
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work , because I love it .
I prefer to be at work than home .
this admission is pain@@ ful , because what kind of person works rather than to be home ?
well , I .
sometimes honest@@ ly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed , none of them .
we go back in the garden , before and back , round and forth .
we make small dance @-@ parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we sh@@ es so@@ ap bu@@ b@@ bles .
I feel overwhel@@ m@@ ingly , ab@@ sent and confused .
I always ri@@ pe after my mobile phone .
yet it is un@@ o.@@ c .
my children show me how to live , and the bu@@ zz of the universe ful@@ fills me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever list@@ ened to the game ?
you can also say it ! always tell yes if your child wants to play with you .
maybe you hold me for nai@@ ve , for a day@@ dreams .
you probably have it right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? you are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play at most 15 minutes with me until they include that they want to make something different .
there are wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes re@@ places the Mari@@ enk@@ ä@@ fer or K@@ eks .
and speak my teenage girl whole 15 minutes long with me , I am mother of the year .
there are only 15 minutes , more needs it not .
each can bring 15 minutes by the piece , even on a bad @-@ La@@ une @-@ day !
15 minutes at the piece !
no mobile phone , no laundry , no distr@@ action .
the day is short : dinner , the children may be ready .
but 15 minutes are dr@@ in !
my children are my charity , my world . it does not have to be the children . it is to feel the tot@@ als to have a place for his soul .
it is not about playing with your children . it is about joy ,
about the &quot; Games &quot; in general .
treat yourself at the 15 minutes !
find out what you do well .
find out and keep it out .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I slept and I can see . friends meet , books to enjoy the day --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stands just for everything I have given up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in the training , when I wanted to make myself more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 Min@@ utes on the play , why not get in full 15 minutes ?
what can it be wrong ? nothing !
the sum@@ men came back in my spare time . the sum@@ men seems to come back when I do not work .
working not without playing .
it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , and I find myself in my office . I hear a conf@@ essed mel@@ ody , she fills me and my soul . she lost me his way . I n@@ ut@@ ze it to the full and love my work again .
I like the sum@@ men , but I do not love it .
I do not need it .
I am not the bu@@ zz , the sums it is not me ... no more .
so@@ ap bu@@ b@@ bles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends .
this is now my mar@@ vel@@ ous .
the sums of life .
the sums of love .
the sums of work is part of me , but just part . and for this I am so appreci@@ ative .
it is fl@@ ed@@ ged to me that I am a titanium . I have never seen a Titan , the trip to Jerusalem .
I said Yes to less work and to play more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still working . my camp@@ fire are still burning .
the more I play , the hap@@ pier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the more clear@@ er my head .
the more I play , the better working I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the sw@@ amp . the land , which I run , the marathon , the ri@@ bb@@ ons , the high sound , the sums , the other , the right sums , the sums of life .
the more I feel this sw@@ amp , the more this unusual , be@@ ating , naked and new feeling of living in me wide . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel exactly this sw@@ amp , the more I know who I am .
I am author . I think these things , I aw@@ aken you to life .
that belongs to the job , which means to live his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
because a dream@@ job should be a little dream@@ like .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too little work and for more games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; want to play ? &quot;
thanks beautiful .
I am neuro@@ logy .
as most of my colleagues I have to do with human trag@@ e@@ dies every day .
I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a severe stroke or after an automobile accident .
for us neuro@@ sur@@ ge@@ ons it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , a very low capacity for self @-@ healing .
after a severe violation of the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , heavy handic@@ ap .
this is probably the reason why I was functional neuro@@ logy .
what is a functional neuro@@ sur@@ geon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by means of various surgical measures .
surely they have heard of one of the most famous one of the &quot; low @-@ cent@@ ric stimulation . &quot; this impl@@ anted one electro@@ de deep in the brain to influence the cir@@ cuits of neur@@ ons so that the neuro@@ logical function improved .
it really is an amazing technology . she has improved the fate of patients with Park@@ inson , which suffered under fi@@ er@@ ce tre@@ m@@ bling and heavy pain .
however , Neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ cure .
the dream of functional neuro@@ ch@@ ir@@ ons is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close .
with some help the brain can help himself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was conduc@@ tive Ober@@ ärz@@ tin and worked day and night at the Res@@ um@@ ption .
often I wor@@ e patients with Schä@@ del @-@ Hir@@ n @-@ Trau@@ ma .
you have to imagine that in Schä@@ del @-@ Hir@@ n @-@ Trau@@ mata the brain an@@ sch@@ will@@ t and the skull @-@ pressure .
to save life , you have to dimin@@ ish the skull .
this sometimes one has to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain .
instead of creating the s@@ wollen brain @-@ mass , we decided to analyse with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist , the brain @-@ mass .
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to leave cells from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
the cells of a tissue @-@ piece can grow , comparable to very small children that are taken out of your family .
you have to find the proper diet , temperature , moisture and the environments to let them flour@@ ish .
this is precisely what we had to do with these cells .
after many trials , Jean @-@ François Hollande .
this he saw under his micro@@ scope .
this was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells , which are surrounded by small , un@@ mature cells .
maybe you know yet from the bi@@ olog@@ ology , that stem cells are ri@@ pe cells that can transform into any cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small N@@ ative of the brain .
it is surprising to maintain this type of stem cells from the surface texture of the brain mass .
we made a further fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die , they are immort@@ al .
but these cells stopped differently .
they split up slowly and after a couple of weeks left them even .
we therefore saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells , but otherwise held .
we needed long to understand , where they came .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells welcome Dou@@ bl@@ ec@@ or@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
you make 4 % of our grand@@ pa cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the bra@@ zing they provide for the folding of the brain .
but why do they stay with us ?
we do not know that .
we believe that they are taking part in the healing of the brain because we find it in higher concentr@@ ations close to brain inj@@ uries .
but that is not so safe .
however , one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells .
we stand in front of a potential cell source , the brain healing .
this had to prove .
so , we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to take a piece of brain @-@ mass from the non @-@ speaking area , and then the cells put exactly as cultiv@@ ate how it did Jean @-@ François
and they can then highlight them in the brain in order to follow them in the brain .
in the last step we re@@ impl@@ anted them at the entrance stop of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ ologist Tran@@ splan@@ tation -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ spl@@ ant .
one of our first questions was what happens when we plan these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we plan the same cells in s@@ wollen brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we were able to work with monkeys .
in the first scenario re@@ impl@@ anted the cells into a healthy brain , and we wat@@ ched that they had been removed completely after some weeks , they were taken back home . the space is already occupied , they are not taken there , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we added an injury to and re@@ impl@@ anted exactly the same cells and now the cells are preserved -- they washed their mature neur@@ ons .
here you can see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were re@@ impl@@ anted .
the proof that they show are these little points . these are the cells we color in vit@@ ro , in the culture of col@@ ouring .
here we could not stop .
are these cells also a monkeys to recover from a brain injury ?
so we f@@ ini@@ zed monkeys with a manual business purpose .
they had to take care of pell@@ ets from a tablet .
they made them very good .
when they reached a stable business level , we last in the motor@@ ic Cort@@ ex the hand@@ mot@@ ori@@ k area .
then , the monkeys were par@@ aly@@ sed , they could no longer be able to move .
just as it would happen with people , they recovered spont@@ ane@@ ously up to a certain extent , just as after a stroke .
patients are par@@ aly@@ sed and then try to rec@@ u@@ per@@ ate themselves with the help of plastic bra@@ in@@ ism . they are reco@@ vering to some extent , just like the monkey .
when we were sure that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery , we impl@@ anted its own cells .
on the left hand they see the monkeys , who turned out spont@@ ane@@ ously .
it can bring about 40 % to 50 % of its original output from violation .
it is not as precise and not so fast .
now see when we re@@ impl@@ anted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the maturity process .
I can tell you that we were also very exciting for us .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can free@@ ze them and use later .
we can use them in other neuro@@ path@@ ological models , for example at Park@@ inson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to im@@ itate them in humans .
I genuin@@ ely hope I can show you soon as the human brain gives the means to heal itself .
many thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ ely@@ ne that &apos;s wonderful , I am sure that just now , several do@@ zen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can need it . &quot;
I definitely .
of course , the question of which the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical studies on the human being .
J@@ oc@@ ely@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results you have to fill out about two kil@@ ogra@@ m papers and forms to pass this kind of studies .
BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and a fast professional team .
BG : look at the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start the clinical studies . if you continue to look forward to the future , how many years it will take until someone can come to hospital and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : this is difficult to say .
first , it depends on the approval of the clinical study .
will it give us the authority to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to choose patients to perform and evaluate the treatments , whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
then you have to apply it to a multi @-@ cent@@ ric study .
you really have to look at first that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ ely@@ ne , thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it .
BG : many thanks .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them as natural .
we do not see democracy as the br@@ ittle plant that is in reality but as invent@@ aris of our society .
we tend to consider it as an un@@ changing reality .
we believe capitalism is forced to kid@@ n@@ ish democracy .
this is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great descendants in Beijing have demonstrated no doubt that it is quite possible to flour@@ ish a blo@@ oming capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
in fact , democracy dis@@ appears with us , in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of the year , when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally made to me as the Minister of Finance in the Euro@@ group -- to influence the democratic process of our country -- &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; austerity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which were fully realized in Greece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at this moment , I thought it could not give a better justi@@ fication for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my sincere friends who would have repeated me to change democracy when they would change anything .
at this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for true democracy .
I ask you to believe in collaboration with me again that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group would believe in an error , we could save democracy but that we need a true and defence democracy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for without democracy our societies are compos@@ ites our future and our great , new technologies are wast@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the topic of waste I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction , which is currently threatened by our economies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tw@@ addle @-@ pl@@ ating parad@@ ox &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the debt , who thro@@ ws their long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the Schul@@ den@@ berg ,
but only a few recognize its Zw@@ illing .
a mountain of un@@ used cash that belongs to the se@@ ful spar@@ ing and corporations , which could be involved there , where it would be productive and income , with which one could produce productive and also all the things that humankind needed , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
in the past three months have been invested in the US , in England and in the euro area , 3.4 Bil@@ li@@ ons US dollars , in all the prosperity producing goods , such as industrial plants , machines , office building , schools , roads , g@@ le@@ ise , equipment , and so on and so forth .
3.4 Bil@@ li@@ ones US dollars sounds like a lot of money , until you compare it with the 5,@@ 1 Bil@@ li@@ ons US dollars , which at the same time were in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing did , except the stock exchange rates and the real estate rate high .
thus the debt and un@@ productive capital is the tw@@ ins of tw@@ ins that does not align themselves with the usual market@@ ability .
the result are stag@@ nat@@ ing wages , over a quarter of 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ old in the US , Japan and Europe work , and consequently , a low demand for economic demand , which could not invest in which they would not invest . just like Ö@@ di@@ pus dad , who would be out of fear , the prophecy of the O@@ rak@@ els could become true that his son would kill him if he grows .
un@@ weigh@@ ed the circumstances that lead to it that o@@ edi@@ pus k@@ ills him k@@ ills .
this is my had@@ ad with capitalism --
its extremely mer@@ ci@@ ous Art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives to develop human talents and to finance especially all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for saving the Earth .
is democracy the solution ?
I think . but before we continue , what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as a society form , in which the outside and the poor control the government as a majority .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy completed too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
however , it would be an error , the significance of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy due to these cl@@ ashes .
the decision in Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that they had the working poor involved , and not only gave them the right to freedom of speech , but more importantly , and more importantly , that they give them the right to political co @-@ determination with equal constitu@@ ency in questions of the prosec@@ ut@@ or .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy could not be held long --
as a cand@@ le , which illumin@@ ates very light , it is also quickly burned out .
however , our present liber@@ als have not their roots in the ancient Athens ,
but in the Mag@@ na C@@ arta , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American Constitution .
while the ath@@ etic democracy focused on free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Mag@@ na C@@ arta , which was ultimately a stat@@ ute for ruling class .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for liberal democracy only came into account as a full separation of politics and economy and the democratic process was executed on policy , so the economy -- therefore the world of corporations -- a democratic free zone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in our present democr@@ acies , since the time , on which the separation of politics and the economy began to take a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two by the economy gradually supp@@ ressed politics and it explo@@ it .
do you wonder why the politicians do not have more so than before ?
it is not at a de@@ generation of its DNA .
it is in mind that today it is possible to be in the government and yet it is not in power because the power of politics is ab@@ dic@@ ed into the economy and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my quar@@ rel with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is in about as a flo@@ ating of pre@@ dat@@ ors , the so sustainable the animals , by which they are nour@@ ished , dec@@ ayed that they are star@@ ving at the end .
similarly , it is with the economy which is not so far @-@ prov@@ oked by the self @-@ caused economic crisis . the power of corporations grows , inequality increases , the overall economic demand falls and the managing director of corporations are to be fri@@ gh@@ tened to invest the cash of their company .
the more successful of capitalism distri@@ butes the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; &#91; the people &#93; from democracy , the higher the tw@@ ins of human labor force , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the welfare of humanity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if this is true , it is obvious that we need to bring politics and business again and it would be better when the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demo@@ s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control re@@ tains as in the ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a new idea .
the Marxist left had this idea about 100 years ago and it wasn &apos;t really good .
the teaching from the deb@@ acle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only nour@@ ished through a miracle like in the ancient Athens without creating new species of brut@@ ality and wast@@ ing .
but there is a solution : the working poor !
capitalism does it by being replaced by Ni@@ ed@@ ri@@ glo@@ hn@@ employ@@ ing by automation and robots .
the issue here is , as long as economy and politics are separate areas , the automation can become tw@@ ins tw@@ ins , and the social conflicts lower , just as I believe -- in countries like China will come .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we need to re@@ unite the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and thereby respect the re@@ united area of democratic , otherwise we will show the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of a documentary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the question is not whether capitalism has the technical achievements which he has produced , will survive --
the most interesting question is whether capitalism is dis@@ solved by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the &quot; matrix &quot; or through something that the company is in &quot; Star Trek &quot; , in which machines are serving the people , or into a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ ener &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long talks with the meaning of life .
I think we can be optim@@ istic .
so what happens it , how could it look to have this &quot; Star Trek &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; matrix &quot; -@@ similar D@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in practical implementation I would like to give you , in all short , some examples name .
in the field of enterprises : please make an capital market before you earn money while working and in which your capital follows you from a company to the next , and the company -- no matter which one is currently working -- is the property of those who currently work in the company .
then we des@@ cen@@ ded all the in@@ comes from capital and from dis@@ solving and the concept of wage labor is completely out@@ dated .
no distinction between those who belong to the companies , but they do not work in it , and employees who work there , but does not draw more between capital and labour , no major gaps between investment and don@@ ate , and ultimately no em@@ por@@ rag@@ ing tw@@ ins .
in the field of global political economy , please take a short notice that our national currencies would have a free fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interest of all humanity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in units of &quot; cosmos &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and each government pays the sum which corresponds to the trade defic@@ it or the trading of the respective country into a common fund . &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine that these funds are investing in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world , in which investments are r@@ ar .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes was proposed in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that at that time one was not the technical means to implement it .
today we have them , especially against the background of a re@@ uni@@ fied policy and economy .
the world that I describe , is at the same time liberal , in which she privileged people prefer@@ ably , and Marxist , because it will buried the separation of capital and labour in the du@@ st@@ bin of history , and key@@ n@@ esi@@ ically , globally key@@ n@@ esi@@ ically .
but above all others it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy .
we will wake up in such a world
or will we t@@ ines into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide on a political basis .
it is in our hands and we do it better democratic .
thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you des@@ crip@@ ve you in your biography as liber@@ t@@ arian Mar@@ xi@@ sts .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if anything of what I have just said , then Marx is relevant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy ... do not do that , technological development will create a massive decline in the entire economic demand , which Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers is called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; long @-@ term st@@ agn@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by transferring this crisis from a part of the earth to the next , as we &apos;re up to date , it will not only dest@@ abil@@ ise our democr@@ acies but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when this analysis is correct , Marx is quite relevant ,
just like Hay@@ ek , that &apos;s why I am a liber@@ t@@ ary play , and how it is Key@@ nes , and that is why I am also fully wir@@ r .
BG : actually , and now we are well too .
Y@@ V : if one is not wir@@ ing , one does not think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosoph@@ ical statement -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein that said that . BG : in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you have very clear what you think of the West &apos;s perspective on China .
would you like to reiter@@ ate it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democr@@ acies we have the sem@@ bl@@ ance of democracy .
as I said in my presentation , we have limited democracy to politics during the area where the most part is playing -- the area of economy -- a completely democratic zone .
in a certain point of view , if I may say so pro@@ voc@@ ative , China today resem@@ bles China today in the UK of the 19th century .
because -- Please remember -- we tend to link liber@@ alism with democracy -- that &apos;s an error , historically .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ ale , like John Stu@@ art Mill --
he was especially sc@@ ep@@ tical , which concerns the democratic development .
what you can see now in China , similar to the evolution that we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
China has now to blame that which the West has done itself in the 19th century , sm@@ ells its hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I am sure that many list@@ en@@ ers are curious about your experiences as a Finance Minister for the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I fores@@ ee that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you see six months later on the first half @-@ year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ appoint@@ ing because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; namely to say goodbye to self @-@ suffici@@ ency , and the continuous den@@ ial that a massive acceler@@ ation line was passed through the eurozone and continues to pursue the development of the whole European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had the opportunity to say on the base of the Greek word -- by the way , the first proposal was that this den@@ ial was reve@@ aling -- &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , they have chosen the powers within the eurozone , within the European group , further den@@ ial the den@@ ial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what comes .
this is the experience from the Soviet Union --
if one tries to obtain an economic system that is not viable , through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ an@@ ism , it will perhaps be able to delay a while , but when the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rupt and destruc@@ tive .
BG : what change are you going ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure .
BG : have you made any mistakes in your time as a Finance Minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- seriously ...
if there is a Finance Minister , or any minister , who after 6 months in office , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , he claims , he did not make an error , then this is a dangerous person .
of course I have made mistakes .
the greatest mistake was to sign the application for extension of the debt program at the end of February .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believed that there was an honest interest on the sides of the don@@ ors to find a common solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that did not give it .
they merely wanted to bring our government because they didn &apos;t want to deal with the los@@ ers who delivered through the eurozone .
they did not want to stand up that for 5 years they were dis@@ astro@@ us a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is worse than during the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; none of the Troika of the len@@ ders who has imposed us this policy was a kol@@ oss@@ al mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive t@@ ons of talks , you seem to be quite a @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is facing , from someone who lives and loves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my greatest fear is that the eurozone is not survived .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for if it is not survi@@ ving , the shared over@@ head will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this will not be dis@@ astro@@ us for Europe alone , but for the entire world economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we ourselves up@@ lift ourselves the path of a post@@ modern 1930 that it appears to me , it will also be de@@ tri@@ mental to the future of Europeans as well as the non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope you are wrong with this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for TED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
by Roy Price , most of them never heard , although he probably is responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you .
this goes back to the decision which Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is conduc@@ t@@ ant at Amazon Studios ,
the TV @-@ production company of Amazon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has a ot @-@ term and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; films , TV , technology , tac@@ os . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for providing the shows and the content to it .
of course this is a very hard @-@ milit@@ ant industry .
there are already so many TV series that Roy cannot choose any one .
he must find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he must find shows that are on the right side of this bend .
this curve is the rating of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB &apos;s website . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this review obtained .
if your show is rated with nine and higher , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these are shows such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bre@@ aking Bad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- all the shows that sh@@ ad@@ dic@@ ed where you ask a season to ask your brain : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the left , here at this end , shows such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ aras &quot; -- &quot; that should tell you enough what is going on at the end of the curve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy Price does not get to get on the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to under@@ go &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ aras . &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the mean extinction , the average watch -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they don &apos;t delight .
so , he must ensure that he really is on the right side .
the pressure is there , and of course it is the first time Amazon as something makes Amazon , so Roy Price does not risk .
he wants to create successes .
he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a contest .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects an evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and presents them online where they can watch everyone for free .
and if Amazon else gives things out , you get to , properly ?
millions of vie@@ wers take a look at these episodes .
however , they don &apos;t know that they are observed when looking at these shows .
they are observed by Roy and his team who are running all .
you realize when you start the show , when one starts , which parts you re@@ j@@ umps and again .
they collect millions of data to use this data then which show it should produce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , they collect the data , process these and it results in the answer , and this is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com about four re@@ publi@@ can U.S. Sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but it seems that not many people remember this show , because it was not so good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is only a average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- since the average of this curve 7,@@ 4 is and Alpha house lan@@ det at 7,5 -- so something about the average , but not exactly what was advertis@@ ed on Roy and his team .
about at the same time with another company , another manager placed a top show through Data Analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always looking to find these a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it something different .
instead of holding a competition , he and his team looked at the existing data about the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the reviews they give the shows , whose course they like etc .
then use this data to find out these small details about the audience : what shows they like , which producers , which actors .
when they had together all the parts , they went a car and decided to do not have a Sit@@ com about four sen@@ ators but a drama series about a Sen@@ ator .
know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards &quot; . Net@@ fli@@ x has so hit a hit , at least for the first two rel@@ ays .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; house of Cards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gets a 9,@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course the question is : what happened ?
man has two very com@@ peti@@ tive , data ver@@ sion@@ ed companies .
they combine these many data with one another and it works great for one of them but not for the other company .
what lies that ?
because logic somehow con@@ ven@@ ed that that should work in everything .
when you collect millions of data for a decision you meet , then you should make a good decision .
one has 200 years to statistics as back @-@ up .
it is optimized using a very powerful computer .
the minus what you can expect is good television , or ?
when Data Analysis does not work , then this is something sc@@ ary because we live in a time when we live more and more statistics to make serious decisions far beyond TV .
does anyone know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
none . OK , that is even good .
multi @-@ health system is a software company and I hope no one in this room will ever come in touch with this software . come with this in touch , you are in prison .
if someone is in prison in the US and for dism@@ iss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge is done or not .
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of decide whether a show will be good or bad , it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate television , 22 minutes that can be real bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this Data Analysis , despite the many data ,
not always creates the best results . it is not that a company like multi @-@ health system does not know how to use data .
even the data is ver@@ sion@@ ed firms are sometimes wrong .
yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes .
2009 , Google announced that they can tell by Daten@@ analyse bur@@ sts of flu , the worst kind , predic@@ tions -- by analy@@ zing the Google research .
it worked beautifully and was a big news @-@ sensation . the success in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
it worked properly clear , year round year after year , until it suddenly no longer worked ,
and no one could say why .
it did not work , this was once again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the release in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data are ver@@ sion@@ ed companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
despite all these errors , data flows in decisions of life - at work , in case of enforcement , in medicine .
so , we should rather make sure that data are helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ based gene@@ tics as an area where some very clever people can use un@@ imagin@@ able many data to make serious decisions as choosing a cancer therapy .
or the development of a drug . over the years I have recognized some patterns over the difference between successful decisions using data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be distributed .
must you ever have a complex problem , do mainly two things :
as in@@ it dis@@ assem@@ ble this problem in its parts , so you can analyze the items ; as a second , you set the items back together to hold a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : apart and again put together .
and now the most important thing : data and data analytics are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to dis@@ integrate a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to en@@ force parts again and then to come to a decision .
there is another tool and we all have it : our brain .
if there is something in which the brain is good , it is parts and pieces to merge again , even if the information is in@@ exhaus@@ tive , in order to then hold a good decision -- especially when it is the brain of an expert .
for this reason , I believe that Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because it used data and mind where they are being held in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience , which otherwise would not be capable of . but decision on how to take all these parts , and make it a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; which was not standing in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant that they entered a great personal risk with that decision .
Amazon , on the other hand did it in the wrong way .
they used data to control all of their decisions , first when they w@@ ow to TV @-@ ideas then as they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they tell us the data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better decisions , but I believe that things go wrong , when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool and not to forget that this device is fairly useful .
many of you will ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; . it is amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or no matter you just need to sh@@ ake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- just here at this moment .
I will become it later with a Technik@@ demo .
so far I have made some decisions in my life , where I should listen to the ball in retro@@ sp@@ ect .
but , as you naturally know if you have the data available , you would like to replace it with a much more exploited , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
thus perhaps the ball t@@ oo@@ kl@@ ed and kl@@ ey , and kl@@ ey . ultimately it is up to us to make decisions , if we want to achieve something exceptional at the end of the right corner .
and I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the great deal of data still pays off , making decisions to be an expert in what you are doing and risks .
because in the end it is not the data , but the risks to which you end up at the right end of the curve .
thanks beautiful .
