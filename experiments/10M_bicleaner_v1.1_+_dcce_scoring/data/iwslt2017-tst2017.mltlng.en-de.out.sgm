<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">They know him perhaps because he won as a New York Times Reporter the Pulitzer Prize.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before any one had heard of Edward Snowden, Risen a book, in which he was spectacular, that the NSA are illegal telephones from Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is a different chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a catastrophic US intelligence service, which passed the CIA to Iran, literally to an atomic bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If the crazy sounds, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who the chapters do not know?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years the government has been established against cracks and asked him to call its inned sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this turn, he became a symbol for the pattern of the government, whistleblower to condemn and possessed journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the first constitutional data, the media has the right to release the secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right, when media cannot receive this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the courageous, which they do.</seg>
<seg id="14">So as the government at mice anchor, he did something that many courageous reporters have already done before him: he refused, and said that he would rather go into prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">So from 2007 to 2015, along with the risk to go to the prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, only days before the process, was something exceptional.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, even though they have been given for years that it would be essential to their case, the demands of the government were falling down.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring the reporter and springs can always hide less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of failing and taking into account, this could also take its digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators have been concerned, without his permission, his telephone was secret,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just as his email data, financial and banking information, its credit card, and even travel agate with the list of its flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblower and risens source.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama spoke with his approach to protect whistleblowers. but instead, the judiciary has condemned more than all US governments before him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem especially because the government has too much from their work as a secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article about national security was the result of a whistleblower to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "we therefore set the press work on the game, which should be protected by the first constitutional data, because the government has ever more options to piping all." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as technology of the government allowed to handle the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">And indeed, they can take this from the moment in which they contact, rather than in retrospect, being in the witness.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there are communication software, which had not yet been written than recessed his book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or telephone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such technology is SecureDrop, an open-source supervising system for whistleblowers, which was originally developed by the Internet-famous which has been developed by us against Aaron Swartz, and is today developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation, where I have been developing, further developed.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending a e-mail, go to an news page, such as the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information such as using any ordinary contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">This will then be encrypted and stored on a server to which only the individual message agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So, the government cannot procure any more information secretly, and many of the information they would call for would not be available from advance.</seg>
<seg id="36">Securedrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately governments all over the world are developing new spy technologies that jeopardized to all of us.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is in us to ensure that not only technology visas like Edward Snowden have a possibility to express misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblowers.</seg>
<seg id="39">The over misuse in the care of soldiers want to envy and report by overwhelmed hospitals. or the next environmental workers, the alarm is defeated by Flint. or a Wallstreet insider which warns us before the next financial crisis.</seg>

<seg id="41">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on 3 April 2016, the largest Datlery of the story published.] [the "Panama Papers" had hidden that empires and mighty] [we] have hidden Robert Palmer of Global Witness around a statement.] this week we have received from messages about a lery of 11 million documents of the law firm Moso Fonseca.</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">We get an impression of how customers, banks and Lawyers to companies such as Moso Fonseca go and say: "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you create it?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the emails, the exchange of messages as the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland Prime Minister has returned.</seg>
<seg id="48">Also, there are reports that a prohibit of the brutal Syrian dictators Baschar al-Assad has offspring in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is said that a trace of 2 billion US dollars has led to Russian President Vladimir Putin, over a narrow friend of children's days, one of the most famous Cellists.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of rich people and others who are nervous about the next release, and the next enthused documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now this sounds like the plot of an agent or a John-Grisham-Romans.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems wept away from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we approach what?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and mighty are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not all pay their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organisation, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">All over the world discuss media and leading politicians, such as the secret tax havens are used by some few to hide and wear, -- something that we have been discussing and collar for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people this whole world seems very confusing, and it is difficult to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I imagine it always like a matrjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">So one has a company in another company, in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible, truly to understand who is behind these encodings.</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what matters is.</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it also interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">Presumably because there were so far no prominent Americans recorded in these revelations, that scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it's not so that there are no abundant Americans who hide their assets in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">But by the principle after which these tax havens work, Mossack Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">Could we have a datlery from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would have much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, it is so that in some U.S. states less information needs less information to found less information to found a company than a library of a library.</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of indifference in the US has allowed the employee of school circulating to hide school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has been contractor allowed to desperish, particularly andue feeder.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does that actually work?</seg>
<seg id="73">Thus, we sent a covert investigators in the offices of 13 firms in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigators gave himself as African Minister, who wanted to bring money into the USA to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked that everyone had suggestions to an Advocate our investigator suggestions how he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">These were all predisposition. none of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course nobody was handed over to the money. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as an individual case.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about an individual attorney, who has been sending proposals backed by our own investigators.</seg>
<seg id="79">It is not about a single top pole, implicated in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It is about how the system works, through the corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to cope with this, we must change the rules of the game.</seg>
<seg id="82">We must change the rules to make this kind of behavior.</seg>
<seg id="83">This may sound quite comforting as if we could do nothing about it; as if nothing could have changed, as if there is always the rich and mighty.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a newborn optimist I really see that some things began to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">Over the past few years we have seen violations of more transparency, which concerns the owners of companies.</seg>
<seg id="86">The subject found political attention from British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU is captured in central registers at the national level, who really is behind companies in Europe, and who controls them.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the United States lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "" "" "representatives of both parties have brought a draft law in both parliamentarians, but this does not make the progress we would like to see." ""</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how these Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness, this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind projected their true identity.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need executives in the economy, which stand up and say," "" "Intransparent is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">We need leading politicians who realize the problem and use it to quit these kind of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="95">Together we can finally stop the Intransparent, which now ends this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering, finally end.</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story, as I was almost kidnapped and in the trunk of a red beast that would be yellow.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I finished my design studies, I made a backyard.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red mazet remained and looked like my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a road trip through whole country. afterwards he would go to the peaccorps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him on a beer. he told me about how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "" "where do you find it tonight?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">He made the whole thing worse, "I do not know it yet."</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought, "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What mach I now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does the situation not know?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got to know him just before! he says he would go to the peace of peace, but I don't know if he is really planning. I will not kidnapped in the trunk of a Mazowland!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard that saying," "" "I have a buff. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "a voice in my head said," "", "how to?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I was in bed, I starred on the ceiling and thought, "Oh Mann! what have I buried there?</seg>
<seg id="114">A wildranssleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I got out of bed, on toe tips to the door, and my dormitory-door closed.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The artwork that he had bought from me still depends in his classroom. he is now teachers.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has completely changed my perspective.</seg>
<seg id="121">Maybe people who were sold to me in childhood as strangers, actually friends who are only waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">To face people on my air matratze was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco I took the bumatratze.</seg>
<seg id="123">Take a stroll, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I am unemployed, almost plastness, my roommate moves out and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I attended that at the time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can create it, fear in fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote my best friend and new co-ommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I talked about how to make something about it. our apartment will accommodate a designer Bed and Breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk, including a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a site and set up so "air rators and breakfast" [AIRBed aNd Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three lucky guests were allowed to sleep up for 20 dollars on the air conditioning on wood flooring.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I am sure our cheese-ham-Omelet narrowed completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them through the whole city. when we passed our last guest and passed the door into the castle, starred Brian and I sat down.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rental rental?</seg>
<seg id="135">The things came in roles.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if you could make a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">Thus, we presented to the investors: "we want to create a site, on the people publicly pictures of their private rooms post, their bedrooms, their baker -- the kind of rooms, whose doors are closing when you visit us.</seg>
<seg id="139">Through the Internet, they can then invite those foreign people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the rocket would ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">Indeed, they do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">Nobody who still is at consolation would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in homes of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we as children all learnt that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">When you have a problem, one spoke to the things that can be good. we could disagree.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie, we had learned that design is much more than just appearance and touching -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to design objects but now we wanted to create trust in design immense trust, between people who had never met.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design make such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create with design confidence?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample of what degree we trust.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-seconds experiment. it will force you out of your comfort.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up, when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like to suspend your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Enter your left cell phone in your left seats.</seg>
<seg id="157">This silent touching of panic, which you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they opening the door first.</seg>
<seg id="158">For the only one that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the cellular phone of a stranger in his hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most are the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So most of the guests feel when they spend elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="163">That is why our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Only time so, who now has Al Gores mobile?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you proclaim on Twitter that he encoding for the office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the mobile phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You now experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I want to tell you of some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we have changed a little detail in this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor could have imagined once with his name; if he would have told where his dog or his children?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you would have 150 maps that all say: "he can really captivated mobile phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel then if you would have to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-conceived feedback system strengthens the confidence decisive.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we did some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for the people to leave negative credit cards.</seg>
<seg id="175">In the end we decided to wait until both host and guest had given their assessments before we set it online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we have discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We have carried out a study with Stanford, as most probably it is that people trust each other, depending on how similar they are regarding age and place of residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprisingly, we trust the people most that are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less confidence we rely.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social default.</seg>
<seg id="181">Captivating it will be if you add the call of a person -- in our case by Beurdepartments.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three assessments, nothing will change.</seg>
<seg id="183">But it has more than ten, changes all.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation stiffness out.</seg>
<seg id="185">So the right design can thus help us overcome some of our deep rooted preference.</seg>
<seg id="186">Furthermore, we learned that confidence depends on how much you get there.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "if you tell too little about how to" "" "Hi!" "", "you will not get an answer." ""</seg>
<seg id="189">Tell me how, for example: "I have problems with my mother" -- -- the request is also rather not accepted.</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimal degree of openness, e.g. "tolle artwork in your apartment! I do with my family vacation."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can we create it with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which topics you should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">"" "" "" "our whole company builds on hope that the right design can help us to overcome our prejudices against strangers." ""</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not reckon was the great amount of men who were more than willing to put these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you can see how many people take advantage of our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">Firstly: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second, the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Thirdly, a need, which had not been covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us the business is just very good.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times when not everything is smoothly running.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have unallowed partys celebrated or apartments slated.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have guests in the rain stand.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked with the customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the front front, when trust was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than this calls. it does hurt, if I just think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that one hear in the voice of the invaers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, from 123 million sold nights only a fraction of the fraction had ever encountered a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">"" "" "" "for people trusted other people rightly." ""</seg>
<seg id="210">When trust works, can thereby create miracle.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests took vacation in Uruguay. there he learned a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even ended blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his evaluation:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travelers who are due to seated actions to heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with plenty of hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real Guardian Angel, who can save the life, even though they do not know one at all.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive one in their own car to the hospital, when you die, and wait, while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want to feel lonely, they bring books over.</seg>
<seg id="220">You can even stay longer without having the extra-nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">Of course, of course, does not run every stay.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money action are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I first asked about this concept I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money transactions together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is here an economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "but it is now just" "" "rental industry" "", "the thing is not justified." ""</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People lay a part of itself open and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">If you travel today is that with fast food compared. it is efficient and reliable, but it is less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">What if traveling would be a rich buffet from local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if at each place we visited, a group there would be waiting to fill out a thoroughly complete and to show one to a pub tour in the neighborhood of which one has never heard before;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star cook?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to shape apartments from the ground up to sitting?</seg>
<seg id="236">How would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the thoughts from the common part?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities which enable us to help society and relations instead of loneliness and downing.</seg>
<seg id="239">In the Korean capital Seoul, this project has already begun. many parking places that the government belonged to</seg>
<seg id="240">Were now offered accents. students who were looking for a bends,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were sent to people whose children were educated. there were Incubatorprogram started,</seg>
<seg id="242">To finance new start-ups in the Share Economy. through our platform alone, night 785 000 people will be guests in 191 countries as a guest in a foreign or even host.</seg>
<seg id="243">The idea seems to be not as crazy as it was brought to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality was also previously mentioned.</seg>
<seg id="246">There have been a similar site before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">Why so why did our work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from happiness and timing we think you can find the right design with the components of confidence.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-minded prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find this astonishing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost to be overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about every time when a red maestead goes past me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know of course that design cannot solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us if it had such a major influence, I wonder why we can use this design soon.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think when looking at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an Expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, a brains underwear, a terrorist?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in the safety slope at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I do not give you blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media people represent that look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">One study began that 80% of the coverage about Islam and Muslims is negatively.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans mean, most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably the people do not speak with their drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For those who have never met a Muslim: it's great to meet you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee party -- double espresso, with cream.</seg>

<seg id="274">I decided to do this.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 years old, I met the decision to outing me.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as homosexual people, like some of my friends, but as Muslim min. I decided to wear the Hijab, my headrest.</seg>

<seg id="309">I saw an extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">The feelings were understandably unfiltered and I also heard from attacks on Muslims or by people who held for Muslims, in the midst, and cutting himself.</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really margins at mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought, we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something felt not right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who had attacked this land, our country had attacked.</seg>

<seg id="317">It is not easy to make sure to explain.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing to questions, I love questions.</seg>

<seg id="321">When will we go on? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like from a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">It is only the question: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know: a malignant tumor can be seen as a whole and a benign tumor, only under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims are like all other Americans, no tumor in the body of the US but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, rhelpers and Olympioniken.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques of America will make safe?</seg>
<seg id="331">It may be free to release a few parking but not the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit of a mosque leads people to regard other faith tolerant, and to show greater citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as the ladder of the police in the region of Washington, DC recently told, people are actually not radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or in bed before a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">When the radicalisation process has found that it begins online. as a first, the person of their community is cut off, even from their families, that the person believes that the person believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and anyone who isolate their behavior and their ideology is a traitor or of faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to avoid radicalization, we must adhere to people to go on the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some are still claiming that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group as the IS has established its brutality with the coran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As a Muslim, as a mother, as a human being, I think we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add ourselves into their imagination if you acknowledge them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux-Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology on their "Holy Book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"" "but if you have a look at them, she does not drive what she does in their" "" "Holy Bible" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality which they can read these things into the scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam told me recently an astonishing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she counts the IS to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said, the problem was exactly the opposite. every clergy had spoken unto them, she brought her to silence and told her that her wrath, her sense for the injustice in the world, it would bring only into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">There was nothing inspired by nothing and something that has given sense to its anger, it was a target for the instrumentalisation through extremists, which you talked a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This hammam introduced the link to God and their church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of embarrassing them for their rage, he showed their constructive ways for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What they learned in the mosque, did it to join it to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight, as the Islamophobia me and my family concerns.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect every other?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour use of fear affects our democracy every day, on our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">A study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: when we fear, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We are more likely to accept an authorized form of government, conformity and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study shows: if one cribes messages in which negative about Muslims has been reported, they agreed rather military attack on Muslim countries and the circumcision of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an accuaded problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you are looking for when the mood against Muslims moved upwards -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the foreground of Iraq war and during two options periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Moslem terror as I expected it.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool for manipulation of the public to sluggish the foundation of a free society, which has reasonable and well-informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it perhaps first, but the toxic air of fear shaded us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the assignment of collective blame it is not just about to explain themselves.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple that lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a athlete.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was talented at the dental Faculty, talented, much promise...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would say to me that he was the sweetest, blessed man, whom she knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was blazed and said:</seg>

<seg id="375">Just a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne, her brother and his wife, her neighbour, Craig Stephen Hicks, she was assassinated, just as the sister of Yusor, Razan that was in the afternoon to visit. he did it in their apartment as when he posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="376">He slept eight times on Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism can not only be amoral but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">Thus back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Are we gone on the mosque or did we remain safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We occupy it and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was about that America we want to leave our children: one that would control us through fear, or one that we can freely pursue our religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We chose the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the child's seat we drove back, with high pressure on the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, my shoes went out, went into the prayer of prayer, and what I saw, let me stop.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was restless filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made an announcement, it thanked and called our guests, for half of the gathered were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, Atheirs, and non-creditors who came to join us, but to join us.</seg>
<seg id="387">At that moment I am broken.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had courage and compassion panic and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose for the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you be sure to proceed?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or become one of those who mean: we are better than those.</seg>

<seg id="409">Before air wrapping into our social consciousness, a autonomous fleet of aircraft in France has built a six meter high tower in France for a six meter high tower from 1 500 goat. a couple of years ago she began to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">Through interlocking aircraft high speed and acceleration at narrow spaces.</seg>
<seg id="411">They can also build self-constantly accessible structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to wear loads to deal with turmoil and to react in general to nature laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of the potential in the autonomous fly.</seg>
<seg id="415">So that a system is autonomous, it must know collectively, where in the room the mobile objects are located.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic Tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For the present demos we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a deriving of our laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in space to determine calculations on board, what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "external commands are there at the highest ecie e. e.g." "" "and" land "" "." "" "</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called rear starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A leaflet that tries, two complies with a flap to beat.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starters, it is efficient in advance, much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most of the starters it can fluctuate, and thus has great advantages in start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However there is always a reciprocal side.</seg>
<seg id="426">A restriction on blecters is that they react sensitive to turbulence such as Windarcs.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the air unit no matter in which position the optimum position can be recovered and the performance by exercise can be improved.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research we often introduce fundamental abstract questions about the core of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be for example: what is the petty-possible number of movable parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopter are known about as machines with a thousand movable parts, which gather together to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Several decades ago, they were able to fly remote-controlled aircraft, which only had two movable parts: a propeller and a tailgate.</seg>
<seg id="435">Unlong we discovered that Fare with just one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monospinner, the mechanical and easiest away air. it was invented in front of the nod.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only one movable part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No lawns, hinges and Querruder, no further actuators or inspectors, only a propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, happens in the interior very much so that it can fly stable and move in space.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear-mounted. to bring it to the fist, I have to put it right correctly.</seg>
<seg id="441">The likelihood, it is accurate, if all of me look, is low, therefore I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening.</seg>
<seg id="442">When the Monospinner is an exercise in pleasantage, this machine is here, the omcouter with its eight propeller, a exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">You see that he is only symmetrically symmetrically.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why it is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">Thereby he receives the general capability,</seg>
<seg id="447">Move in the room into all directions, no matter which direction it is filmed or even as he was rotating.</seg>
<seg id="448">Naturally it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight propellants.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some is imaginable in models, the rest is learned right at the case.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's look at this.</seg>
<seg id="451">When flying machines should be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is composed of two separate two-propeller formers.</seg>
<seg id="453">This turns into clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against the clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you build them, they act like a high-performance quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">However, there is something wrong -- a motor or propeller drop out, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can continue to fly further, even restricted.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate that by doing a half airplane.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration investigated synthetic resellers.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took commercial micro-quadcopter -- every single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where in the room it is and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully motivate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly secure machine as drpracticing would like to be on Broadway a flying lampshade.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types such as us is the reward in development and creation.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as remembrance as wonderful and magical our universe is, and that it permits creative, smart creatures, to form them in a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such solid commercial and economic potential, the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Many thanks.</seg>

<seg id="478">About 25 years ago a group of especially courageous -- Rai Weiss decided by MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever of Caltech -- to look for a huge laser detector to look for gravitational cubes that arise about by colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most they thought they were crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized them as crazy genies, so that the US National Science Foundation contributed their idea financially.</seg>
<seg id="481">In decades of decades, construction, conception and extremely hard work built it the detector LIGO: the laser interferometric gravitational-observatory-observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">During the following time, the precision of LIGO could be increased considerably, as the recognition capacity considerably enhanced.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is called Advanced LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015 LIGO was launched for a last test run around some smaller, stubborn problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On 14 September 2015, only a few days after the start-up of the detector, the Gravitational-waves of the two collide black holes are through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>

<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell of my todransill father.</seg>
<seg id="491">That is why they were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All this, for what I have worked is no longer Science Fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist in black holes and their by observatories like LIGO measurable signals. what are the gravitational waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a crusation in the house of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">At temporary the wave will stretch the space and its entire content into a direction, and into the other leanings.</seg>
<seg id="495">To illustrate, lecturers lead courses to reperceptions often a properly alberty dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">Stretch and storage, stretching and storage. "</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational-waves extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On 14th September, for example, each of us extends to the waves of the waves and gestation. the stretching of an average human was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">"" "this means" "" "20 zeros after the comma, followed by a 1." "" "said the LIGO staff for crazy." ""</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometre laser detector, and that is already absurd, this length would have to be exactly measured on less than a thousand miles of the radius of a nuclear nucleus. this is grotesk.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text through engravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">Kip Thorne, a co-founder LIGOs, the hunt for the waves as follows: "the technical difficulties in the construction of such detectors are enormous.</seg>
<seg id="503">But physicist are finically and with the support of the public, all obstacles are overcome. "</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne released this 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to LIGO. Scott claims, LIGO is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than the things around us: facial extracts, the size of your cellphones.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite handy. because so you can customize a picture or a map of things by watching the light around you by several points.</seg>
<seg id="509">For tones is that differently.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">That is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to make a picture of things that you mean a lot of things:</seg>
<seg id="512">The face of your child approximately.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead we listen to certain properties such as tonight and height, rhythm and volume, to close to the story behind it.</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "" "" "now she speaks Alice." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="515">"" "" "" "and Bob disbreaks it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="516">"silly Bob".</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot make easy images of objects in the universe with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by considering changes in amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least available for LIGO the measured frequencies in the audible area.</seg>
<seg id="521">So if we want to convert breakwater into schall, we can literally speak the universe.</seg>
<seg id="522">The gravitation to laugh can give us about a lot about the collision of two black holes, making my colleague Scott has been busy very long.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotating holes, ppen simple: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Turning the two bodies very quickly, you hear the same circus with an additional key change. this sounds like the Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement of motion, penetrated into the wavelength.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on 14 September 2015 -- a date, which at least I will never forget -- heard LIGO Following: [surrendes noise] Jemand, who knows what he has to listen to he recognises this as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes with each 30-fold sun mass, which is about as fast as the rods of your mixer.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let us know what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the dense body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, revolve each one hundred times per second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know about it because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the permanent importance of LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="533">LIGO lays a completely new way to exploration of the universe, as it was never before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can hear the space and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in space, we can see -- practically or basically -- not visible.</seg>
<seg id="536">A Supernova, for example. I would like to know why masks stars in Supernovae explode.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we have learned a lot about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">The exciting physical processes will happen in the nucleus, which lies behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon hidden.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see through, since this opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational waves penetrate iron, as if it would be transparent glass. I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it because the urine is hidden through his own overlights.</seg>
<seg id="541">Using gravitational waves, it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important thing: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen that we have never seen before and from whom we have no idea of what we can only discover by listening to it.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact LIGO just found in the first attempt of things that we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO project, says to this topic: ME: the kind of stars, the black holes, like LIGO them observed, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, urold body of prehistoric times. the black holes are so much the Saurierknochen for our archeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">LIGO allows us to completely different perspectives on the events in the universe, on the formation of the stars and ultimately also on how we went out of this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now exists as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to LIGO, we know how to build great Detectors and listen to the rustling and ppen of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and All.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than the urine?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Do you dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="554">A while ago I tried an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "for one year I would say to all" "" "Yes!" "" "I was afraid of that I was afraid." ""</seg>
<seg id="556">Whether it was nervous about me, made me in unpleasant situations, I zwang me to say 'yes.</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak in the public domain?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to start playing with the swap?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, but yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: exactly that to do, wovor I was afraid, recated my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear, speeches to keep, my social fear -- Puff, weg.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of one word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes" has changed my life.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain Yes, that changed my life deeply, to an unexpected kind. it all started with a question of my youngest.</seg>
<seg id="569">I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the youngest, called for unexplained reasons all 'kittens, "</seg>
<seg id="570">As if they were a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"kittens, I need milk for my beak."</seg>
<seg id="572">She asked me if I could play with her when I was just on the go. and I said, "yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This YES was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new way of living in my family. from there I felt like to play with them as soon as you ask me. no matter what I am doing, or where I go, I say yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Fast. I am not perfect, but I would remember very much.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, on my children, to our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has a flowering side effect: only recently, I really got that the 'yes' -Sages to play with my children my career saved.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dreamjob.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am author. I think these things come up to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Great job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Great job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I creire television. I produced television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I make TV, in great style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season, I am responsible for making 70 hours of program in the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programs, 70 hours television. three to four shows are simultaneously production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Every shipment has hundreds of jobs, which did not exist.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a television station can lie between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode all nine days times four shows, so all nine days 20 million dollar television, four TV programs, three episodes, at the same time: 24 episodes: Grey's, 21 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours television,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my television series run to each other on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">Around the world, my series run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million people.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broadcasts that I have created themselves, and not just produced, so still obelclean. I have to find time, really silent, creative time to gather my fans around campfire and to tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV shows, 70 hours television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfire that burn around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who does that make?</seg>
<seg id="598">Nobody, because of this I am a titanium.</seg>
<seg id="599">Great job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I would not like to impress you with this.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it, because I know what you think, when the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">I say it to you, so that all of you who work so hard if you now speak a company, a country or a classroom to take me seriously, so that I say not only on the computer and imaginative, and it is true, when I say, I understand that it does not get dreaming at a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It's all a job, everything work, everything reality, everything blood, all perspiration -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work a lot, tough and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I am verted into the work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country of nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is, when I set troops on canvas, I found on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">As dreamy you have a high tone, provided a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">It feels like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanical, tiring and intoxicating, funny and maternal, cruel and rational, cruel and rational, and the best thing is the summing.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work is well running.</seg>
<seg id="614">A buzz begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzz stops like a bustling street, I could go for ever on her.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people take them when I declare the swamp that I talk to writing that writing my pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="616">Do not understand me wrong, doing it.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the sums up -- when I began working with TV production when I began to work and to work, build and working together, I discovered this thing, this sums, this energy.</seg>
<seg id="618">The summen is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">Summen is action and activity. the totals is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The totals is music. the totals is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The sums of God is the voice of God in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a buzz, then you can not strive other than to the size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling, no different to be able than to strive for size, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the Summon.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or perhaps it also means a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is called ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I do not know it.</seg>
<seg id="630">I just know that I was not afraid to fail and I just know that I love the totals.</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to tell you, I am a Titan, and I know that I don't want it to question.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make a clear one: the more successful I will, the more the more embraced boundaries, the more work there, the more of the same simultaneously, the more observe me the more I write history, the more expectations there are.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to succeed, the more I must work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what do I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love job, not true?</seg>
<seg id="636">The land, which I create, the marathon, which I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound, the sums, the sums, the sums.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this summery. I love the totals.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the swamp. I am the wresting.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this summing?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then stops the totals.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revised, overexposed, exaggerated, burned.</seg>
<seg id="642">The ear stops.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now, my three daughters have used to the truth that her mom is a single working institute.</seg>
<seg id="644">"" "Harper tells people:" "" "my mum will not be there, but you can write my Nanny." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="645">"" "and Emerson says," "" "kittens, I want to go to Shonda-Land." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">You are baby-Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1, when the Summen stopped.</seg>
<seg id="649">The summing of the engine was mute.</seg>
<seg id="650">I did not love my job anymore. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The summen did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My marvelous was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I made the same things as always: the same title-work, 15 hours-day, did not repentance, no repentance, nothing delegating, a titanium sleeps, does not give up, with all my heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">"" "" "" "but there was no marvelous." ""</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a show-Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was gray, I just had no fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">All I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the summen and the wresting was me.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do, if what you do, the work you love, suddenly twisted?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "I know, some may think:" "" "pitched You from the author-Titan." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know, you do, you are doing what you are doing, a banker to be a painter, a painter, Bill Gates, and knows how to feel the swamp, when you knew the swamp already, when the sums were stops, who is man then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a titanium?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song of my heart hears, I can survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">And then I puts my "southern states waitress" for a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I am on the way to the outside, late and she says," "" "Mama, magst you playing?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I just want to say, when two things will be aware of:</seg>
<seg id="674">First, I have to say yes to everything and secondly, they didn't feel "kittens."</seg>
<seg id="675">It calls anyone more "kittens."</seg>
<seg id="676">When is this happened?</seg>
<seg id="677">I miss it when I am Titan bin and my swamp, and here everything is changing from my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "and so she says," "" "Mama, how you play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say, "yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play and her sisters also encounter, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book "Body Poops."</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing exceptional.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and my panic, in the loneliness and lack of swelling, I can do nothing except to hang out.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focussed.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">The country, which I create, the marathon, which I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound - they no longer exist.</seg>
<seg id="687">Everything that exists are glurige finger and humid shots, delicate voices, waxing and the song, in which it is to release, or whatever the girl in "The icking can be releasing.</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air at this place is so short that I can barely breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me solve.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes into and an energy ub comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that is not immediately, but it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The summen comes slowly back.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, hardly there, it is quiet, hardly audible, but it is there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the sums, but a buzz.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I would know a magical secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let us remain at the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that is all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something that we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The sums, working environment, the working environment, which is only the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, if I tell you, who I am when I am accused with broadcasts and TV hours and how to function my brain, then I have forgotten what the real sums.</seg>
<seg id="707">The summen is not a force and it is not unemployed.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real summen is dependent on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The sums of the river is the river that comes from the life of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The true vine is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real sums ignores the pressure of history, which is illuminating tasks, expectation and printing.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sums is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real sums of God is the voice of my ear, but perhaps I blaze me the wrong words, because from which God said to me that I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a bit more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me I will say yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I do this for the firm rule, so that I can free myself as a workaholic of any fault.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no choice. I have no choice if I want to hear the swamp again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in games, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Play is not always in front of me as they work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth does hurt,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work, because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer to be at work than home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This admission is painful, because what kind of person works rather than to be home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">Sometimes honestly, I call myself "Titan" --</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed, none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">We go back in the garden, before and back, round and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance-parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We shes soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">I feel overwhelmingly, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always ripe after my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">Yet it is uno.c.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the buzz of the universe fulfills me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why have we ever listened to the game?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also say it! always tell yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you hold me for naive, for a daydreams.</seg>
<seg id="742">You probably have it right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? you are not Rihanna or a muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play at most 15 minutes with me until they include that they want to make something different.</seg>
<seg id="748">There are wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes replaces the Marienkäfer or Keks.</seg>
<seg id="750">And speak my teenage girl whole 15 minutes long with me, I am mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">There are only 15 minutes, more needs it not.</seg>
<seg id="752">Each can bring 15 minutes by the piece, even on a bad-Laune-day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes at the piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile phone, no laundry, no distraction.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children may be ready.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are drin!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my charity, my world. it does not have to be the children. it is to feel the totals to have a place for his soul.</seg>
<seg id="758">It is not about playing with your children. it is about joy,</seg>
<seg id="759">About the "Games" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself at the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you do well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and keep it out.</seg>
<seg id="763">I'm not perfect in it. I slept and I can see. friends meet, books to enjoy the day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"" "" "" "want to play?" "" "stands just for everything I have given up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in the training, when I wanted to make myself more and more." ""</seg>
<seg id="765">15 Minutes on the play, why not get in full 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can it be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The summen came back in my spare time. the summen seems to come back when I do not work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working not without playing.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months a door opens, and I find myself in my office. I hear a confessed melody, she fills me and my soul. she lost me his way. I nutze it to the full and love my work again.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the summen, but I do not love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I do not need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the buzz, the sums it is not me... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">This is now my marvelous.</seg>
<seg id="775">The sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sums of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The sums of work is part of me, but just part. and for this I am so appreciative.</seg>
<seg id="778">It is fledged to me that I am a titanium. I have never seen a Titan, the trip to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said Yes to less work and to play more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still working. my campfire are still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the happier I and my children.</seg>
<seg id="782">The more I play, the more I feel as a good mother.</seg>
<seg id="783">The more I play, the more clearer my head.</seg>
<seg id="784">The more I play, the better working I work.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I play, the more I hear the swamp. the land, which I run, the marathon, the ribbons, the high sound, the sums, the other, the right sums, the sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I feel this swamp, the more this unusual, beating, naked and new feeling of living in me wide. less Titan -- more I!</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I feel exactly this swamp, the more I know who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I am author. I think these things, I awaken you to life.</seg>
<seg id="789">That belongs to the job, which means to live his dream.</seg>
<seg id="790">This is the dream of this job,</seg>
<seg id="791">Because a dreamjob should be a little dreamlike.</seg>
<seg id="792">"" "I said" "" "Yes" "" "too little work and for more games." ""</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thanks beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am neurology.</seg>
<seg id="797">As most of my colleagues I have to do with human tragedies every day.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to another, after a severe stroke or after an automobile accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeons it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, a very low capacity for self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a severe violation of the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, heavy handicap.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I was functional neurology.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by means of various surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">Surely they have heard of one of the most famous one of the "low-centric stimulation." this implanted one electrode deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neurons so that the neurological function improved.</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. she has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson, which suffered under fierce trembling and heavy pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">However, Neuromodulation does not mean Neuro-cure.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurochirons is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help himself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was conductive Oberärztin and worked day and night at the Resumption.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I wore patients with Schädel-Hirn-Trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">You have to imagine that in Schädel-Hirn-Traumata the brain anschwillt and the skull-pressure.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save life, you have to diminish the skull.</seg>
<seg id="816">This sometimes one has to remove a part of swollen brain.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of creating the swollen brain-mass, we decided to analyse with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, the brain-mass.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to leave cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">The cells of a tissue-piece can grow, comparable to very small children that are taken out of your family.</seg>
<seg id="822">You have to find the proper diet, temperature, moisture and the environments to let them flourish.</seg>
<seg id="823">This is precisely what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many trials, Jean-François Hollande.</seg>
<seg id="825">This he saw under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">This was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells, which are surrounded by small, unmature cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Maybe you know yet from the biologology, that stem cells are ripe cells that can transform into any cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small Native of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to maintain this type of stem cells from the surface texture of the brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made a further fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells stopped differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They split up slowly and after a couple of weeks left them even.</seg>
<seg id="836">We therefore saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like stem cells, but otherwise held.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand, where they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells welcome Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">You make 4% of our grandpa cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of the brazing they provide for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay with us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they are taking part in the healing of the brain because we find it in higher concentrations close to brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">But that is not so safe.</seg>
<seg id="848">However, one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We stand in front of a potential cell source, the brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">This had to prove.</seg>
<seg id="851">So, we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to take a piece of brain-mass from the non-speaking area, and then the cells put exactly as cultivate how it did Jean-François</seg>
<seg id="853">And they can then highlight them in the brain in order to follow them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step we reimplanted them at the entrance stop of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologist Transplantation -- Autotransplant.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was what happens when we plan these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we plan the same cells in swollen brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we were able to work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario reimplanted the cells into a healthy brain, and we watched that they had been removed completely after some weeks, they were taken back home. the space is already occupied, they are not taken there, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we added an injury to and reimplanted exactly the same cells and now the cells are preserved -- they washed their mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you can see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were reimplanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">The proof that they show are these little points. these are the cells we color in vitro, in the culture of colouring.</seg>
<seg id="863">Here we could not stop.</seg>
<seg id="864">Are these cells also a monkeys to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we finized monkeys with a manual business purpose.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take care of pellets from a tablet.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made them very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they reached a stable business level, we last in the motoric Cortex the handmotorik area.</seg>
<seg id="869">Then, the monkeys were paralysed, they could no longer be able to move.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen with people, they recovered spontaneously up to a certain extent, just as after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">Patients are paralysed and then try to recuperate themselves with the help of plastic brainism. they are recovering to some extent, just like the monkey.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were sure that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted its own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left hand they see the monkeys, who turned out spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can bring about 40% to 50% of its original output from violation.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not as precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now see when we reimplanted the cells: the same monkey, two months after the maturity process.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that we were also very exciting for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and use later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neuropathological models, for example at Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to imitate them in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I genuinely hope I can show you soon as the human brain gives the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne that's wonderful, I am sure that just now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think: "I know someone who can need it."</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question of which the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical studies on the human being.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results you have to fill out about two kilogram papers and forms to pass this kind of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and a fast professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look at the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start the clinical studies. if you continue to look forward to the future, how many years it will take until someone can come to hospital and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: this is difficult to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the approval of the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it give us the authority to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to choose patients to perform and evaluate the treatments, whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">Then you have to apply it to a multi-centric study.</seg>
<seg id="897">You really have to look at first that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider them as natural.</seg>
<seg id="903">We do not see democracy as the brittle plant that is in reality but as inventaris of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider it as an unchanging reality.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe capitalism is forced to kidnish democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great descendants in Beijing have demonstrated no doubt that it is quite possible to flourish a blooming capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">In fact, democracy disappears with us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">"" "" "" "at the beginning of the year, when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unequivocally made to me as the Minister of Finance in the Eurogroup -- to influence the democratic process of our country --" "" "austerity" "" "which were fully realized in Greece." ""</seg>
<seg id="910">At this moment, I thought it could not give a better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my sincere friends who would have repeated me to change democracy when they would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for true democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you to believe in collaboration with me again that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup would believe in an error, we could save democracy but that we need a true and defence democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">"" "" "" "for without democracy our societies are composites our future and our great, new technologies are wasted." ""</seg>
<seg id="914">For the topic of waste I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction, which is currently threatened by our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">"" "I call it the" "" "twaddle-plating paradox" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known to you. you know and recognize him as the debt, who throws their long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the Schuldenberg,</seg>
<seg id="918">But only a few recognize its Zwilling.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash that belongs to the seful sparing and corporations, which could be involved there, where it would be productive and income, with which one could produce productive and also all the things that humankind needed, for example "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">In the past three months have been invested in the US, in England and in the euro area, 3.4 Billions US dollars, in all the prosperity producing goods, such as industrial plants, machines, office building, schools, roads, gleise, equipment, and so on and so forth.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 Billiones US dollars sounds like a lot of money, until you compare it with the 5,1 Billions US dollars, which at the same time were in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing did, except the stock exchange rates and the real estate rate high.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus the debt and unproductive capital is the twins of twins that does not align themselves with the usual marketability.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result are stagnating wages, over a quarter of 25-54-year-old in the US, Japan and Europe work, and consequently, a low demand for economic demand, which could not invest in which they would not invest. just like Ödipus dad, who would be out of fear, the prophecy of the Orakels could become true that his son would kill him if he grows.</seg>
<seg id="925">Unweighed the circumstances that lead to it that oedipus kills him kills.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my hadad with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">Its extremely mercious Art. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives to develop human talents and to finance especially all the technologies, "green" technologies that are decisive for saving the Earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I think. but before we continue, what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as a society form, in which the outside and the poor control the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy completed too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be an error, the significance of the Athenian democracy due to these clashes.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decision in Athenian democracy was and is that they had the working poor involved, and not only gave them the right to freedom of speech, but more importantly, and more importantly, that they give them the right to political co-determination with equal constituency in questions of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy could not be held long --</seg>
<seg id="936">As a candle, which illuminates very light, it is also quickly burned out.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our present liberals have not their roots in the ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the athetic democracy focused on free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Magna Carta, which was ultimately a statute for ruling class.</seg>
<seg id="940">"" "" "" "for liberal democracy only came into account as a full separation of politics and economy and the democratic process was executed on policy, so the economy -- therefore the world of corporations -- a democratic free zone." ""</seg>
<seg id="941">In our present democracies, since the time, on which the separation of politics and the economy began to take a relentless struggle between the two by the economy gradually suppressed politics and it exploit.</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why the politicians do not have more so than before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not at a degeneration of its DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is in mind that today it is possible to be in the government and yet it is not in power because the power of politics is abdiced into the economy and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my quarrel with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is in about as a floating of predators, the so sustainable the animals, by which they are nourished, decayed that they are starving at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">Similarly, it is with the economy which is not so far-provoked by the self-caused economic crisis. the power of corporations grows, inequality increases, the overall economic demand falls and the managing director of corporations are to be frightened to invest the cash of their company.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful of capitalism distributes the "demos" [the people] from democracy, the higher the twins of human labor force, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the welfare of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="949">"" "if this is true, it is obvious that we need to bring politics and business again and it would be better when the" "" "demos" "" "control retains as in the ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners." ""</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea about 100 years ago and it wasn't really good.</seg>
<seg id="952">The teaching from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only nourished through a miracle like in the ancient Athens without creating new species of brutality and wasting.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by being replaced by Niedriglohnemploying by automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The issue here is, as long as economy and politics are separate areas, the automation can become twins twins, and the social conflicts lower, just as I believe -- in countries like China will come.</seg>
<seg id="956">"" "" "" "so we need to reunite the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and thereby respect the reunited area of democratic, otherwise we will show the" "" "matrix" "" "of a documentary" "" "matrix" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="957">The question is not whether capitalism has the technical achievements which he has produced, will survive --</seg>
<seg id="958">The most interesting question is whether capitalism is dissolved by a dystopia, similar to the "matrix" or through something that the company is in "Star Trek", in which machines are serving the people, or into a high-tech version of the ancient Athener "Agora," in long talks with the meaning of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we can be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what happens it, how could it look to have this "Star Trek" -like utopia instead of the "matrix" -similar Dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation I would like to give you, in all short, some examples name.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the field of enterprises: please make an capital market before you earn money while working and in which your capital follows you from a company to the next, and the company -- no matter which one is currently working -- is the property of those who currently work in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then we descended all the incomes from capital and from dissolving and the concept of wage labor is completely outdated.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between those who belong to the companies, but they do not work in it, and employees who work there, but does not draw more between capital and labour, no major gaps between investment and donate, and ultimately no emporraging twins.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the field of global political economy, please take a short notice that our national currencies would have a free fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which is issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [group of the 20 largest emerging countries], in the interest of all humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">"" "furthermore, imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it" "" "Cosmos" "", "in units of" cosmos "" "" and each government pays the sum which corresponds to the trade deficit or the trading of the respective country into a common fund. "" "</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that these funds are investing in "green" technologies, especially in parts of the world, in which investments are rar.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes was proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time one was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today we have them, especially against the background of a reunified policy and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world that I describe, is at the same time liberal, in which she privileged people preferably, and Marxist, because it will buried the separation of capital and labour in the dustbin of history, and keynesiically, globally keynesiically.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all others it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">We will wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we tines into a "matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide on a political basis.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better democratic.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You descripve you in your biography as libertarian Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if anything of what I have just said, then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">"" "the reason for the reunification of politics and economy... do not do that, technological development will create a massive decline in the entire economic demand, which Larry Summers is called" "" "long-term stagnation" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="984">"" "" "" "by transferring this crisis from a part of the earth to the next, as we're up to date, it will not only destabilise our democracies but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low." ""</seg>
<seg id="985">When this analysis is correct, Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Just like Hayek, that's why I am a libertary play, and how it is Keynes, and that is why I am also fully wirr.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: actually, and now we are well too.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if one is not wiring, one does not think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical statement -- YV: actually it was Einstein that said that. BG: in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you have very clear what you think of the West's perspective on China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to reiterate it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the semblance of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my presentation, we have limited democracy to politics during the area where the most part is playing -- the area of economy -- a completely democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In a certain point of view, if I may say so provocative, China today resembles China today in the UK of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">Because -- Please remember -- we tend to link liberalism with democracy -- that's an error, historically.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberale, like John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was especially sceptical, which concerns the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What you can see now in China, similar to the evolution that we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">China has now to blame that which the West has done itself in the 19th century, smells its hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as a Finance Minister for the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I foresee that this is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you see six months later on the first half-year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">"" "" "" "namely to say goodbye to self-sufficiency, and the continuous denial that a massive acceleration line was passed through the eurozone and continues to pursue the development of the whole European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="1007">"" "" "" "we had the opportunity to say on the base of the Greek word -- by the way, the first proposal was that this denial was revealing --" ""</seg>
<seg id="1008">"" "" "" "unfortunately, they have chosen the powers within the eurozone, within the European group, further denial the denial." ""</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience from the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If one tries to obtain an economic system that is not viable, through political will and authoritarianism, it will perhaps be able to delay a while, but when the change occurs, it happens abrupt and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what change are you going ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: have you made any mistakes in your time as a Finance Minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- seriously...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a Finance Minister, or any minister, who after 6 months in office, especially in such a tense situation, he claims, he did not make an error, then this is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I have made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The greatest mistake was to sign the application for extension of the debt program at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">"" "" "" "I believed that there was an honest interest on the sides of the donors to find a common solution." ""</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that did not give it.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They merely wanted to bring our government because they didn't want to deal with the losers who delivered through the eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They did not want to stand up that for 5 years they were disastrous a catastrophic program in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost one third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">"" "there is worse than during the" "" "Great Depression." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1026">"" "none of the Troika of the lenders who has imposed us this policy was a kolossal mistake." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive tons of talks, you seem to be quite a-European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">"" "" "" "my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is facing, from someone who lives and loves." ""</seg>
<seg id="1030">My greatest fear is that the eurozone is not survived.</seg>
<seg id="1031">"" "for if it is not surviving, the shared overhead will be demonic and destroy the European Union." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1032">This will not be disastrous for Europe alone, but for the entire world economy.</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">If we ourselves uplift ourselves the path of a postmodern 1930 that it appears to me, it will also be detrimental to the future of Europeans as well as the non-Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope you are wrong with this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Yanis, thank you for TED.</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">By Roy Price, most of them never heard, although he probably is responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision which Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is conductant at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV-production company of Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"" "he is 47 years old, slim, has a ot-term and describes himself on Twitter as" "" "films, TV, technology, tacos." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for providing the shows and the content to it.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course this is a very hard-militant industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are already so many TV series that Roy cannot choose any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He must find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he must find shows that are on the right side of this bend.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the rating of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB's website. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this review obtained.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is rated with nine and higher, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"" "these are shows such as" "" "Breaking Bad" "" "Game of Thrones," "" "The Wire" "" "-- all the shows that shaddiced where you ask a season to ask your brain:" "" "where are there more of these episodes?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"" "on the left, here at this end, shows such as" "" "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- "that should tell you enough what is going on at the end of the curve." ""</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not get to get on the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to undergo "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts about the mean extinction, the average watch -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they don't delight.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So, he must ensure that he really is on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is there, and of course it is the first time Amazon as something makes Amazon, so Roy Price does not risk.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he holds a contest.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and selects an evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and presents them online where they can watch everyone for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon else gives things out, you get to, properly?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers take a look at these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they don't know that they are observed when looking at these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are observed by Roy and his team who are running all.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You realize when you start the show, when one starts, which parts you rejumps and again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to use this data then which show it should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"" "in fact, they collect the data, process these and it results in the answer, and this is:" "" "Amazon should make a Sitcom about four republican U.S. Senators." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1069">You made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"" "yes," "" "Alpha House" "", "but it seems that not many people remember this show, because it was not so good." ""</seg>
<seg id="1072">It is only a average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- since the average of this curve 7,4 is and Alpha house landet at 7,5 -- so something about the average, but not exactly what was advertised on Roy and his team.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About at the same time with another company, another manager placed a top show through Data Analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. just like Roy, he is always looking to find these a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it something different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of holding a competition, he and his team looked at the existing data about the Netflix audience, so the reviews they give the shows, whose course they like etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then use this data to find out these small details about the audience: what shows they like, which producers, which actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had together all the parts, they went a car and decided to do not have a Sitcom about four senators but a drama series about a Senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards". Netflix has so hit a hit, at least for the first two relays.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"" "" "" "house of Cards" "" "gets a 9,1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go." ""</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course the question is: what happened?</seg>
<seg id="1081">Man has two very competitive, data versioned companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They combine these many data with one another and it works great for one of them but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What lies that?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow convened that that should work in everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">When you collect millions of data for a decision you meet, then you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">One has 200 years to statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized using a very powerful computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The minus what you can expect is good television, or?</seg>
<seg id="1089">When Data Analysis does not work, then this is something scary because we live in a time when we live more and more statistics to make serious decisions far beyond TV.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">None. OK, that is even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-health system is a software company and I hope no one in this room will ever come in touch with this software. come with this in touch, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in prison in the US and for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge is done or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of decide whether a show will be good or bad, it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate television, 22 minutes that can be real bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this Data Analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always creates the best results. it is not that a company like multi-health system does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data is versioned firms are sometimes wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">2009, Google announced that they can tell by Datenanalyse bursts of flu, the worst kind, predictions -- by analyzing the Google research.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked beautifully and was a big news-sensation. the success in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked properly clear, year round year after year, until it suddenly no longer worked,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It did not work, this was once again a sensation, including the revocation of the release in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data are versioned companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all these errors, data flows in decisions of life - at work, in case of enforcement, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So, we should rather make sure that data are helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-based genetics as an area where some very clever people can use unimaginable many data to make serious decisions as choosing a cancer therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I have recognized some patterns over the difference between successful decisions using data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be distributed.</seg>
<seg id="1110">Must you ever have a complex problem, do mainly two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">As init disassemble this problem in its parts, so you can analyze the items; as a second, you set the items back together to hold a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: apart and again put together.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analytics are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to disintegrate a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to enforce parts again and then to come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool and we all have it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something in which the brain is good, it is parts and pieces to merge again, even if the information is inexhaustive, in order to then hold a good decision -- especially when it is the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">For this reason, I believe that Netflix was so successful because it used data and mind where they are being held in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience, which otherwise would not be capable of. but decision on how to take all these parts, and make it a show like "House of Cards" which was not standing in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant that they entered a great personal risk with that decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon, on the other hand did it in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all of their decisions, first when they wow to TV-ideas then as they chose "Alpha House" as show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a safe decision because they could always say:" "" "they tell us the data." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better decisions, but I believe that things go wrong, when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool and not to forget that this device is fairly useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is also called "Magic 8 Ball". it is amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or no matter you just need to shake the ball to get an answer. "most likely" -- just here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will become it later with a Technikdemo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far I have made some decisions in my life, where I should listen to the ball in retrospect.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you naturally know if you have the data available, you would like to replace it with a much more exploited, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">Thus perhaps the ball tookled and kley, and kley. ultimately it is up to us to make decisions, if we want to achieve something exceptional at the end of the right corner.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the great deal of data still pays off, making decisions to be an expert in what you are doing and risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because in the end it is not the data, but the risks to which you end up at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thanks beautiful.</seg>
