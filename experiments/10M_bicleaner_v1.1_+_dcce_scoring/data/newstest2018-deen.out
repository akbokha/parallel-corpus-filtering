Munich 18@@ 56 : four cards that change your view of the city
a Ir@@ ren @-@ An@@ st@@ alt where young people should encounter today .
a greeting , where it is now excav@@ ated for the S @-@ Bahn .
small @-@ gar@@ dener manage the lon@@ ging basis of farmers .
the oldest official card of Mün@@ sing encourages exciting stories to days .
it is nervous when maps are not up to date .
this knows everybody who had to look for a long time because the auto @-@ Nav@@ i instead showed a green meadow .
the historic maps of the Digital Bayern @-@ At@@ l@@ ase , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als of Bavaria of the State Government , are anything but up @-@ to @-@ date - but is therefore very ab@@ y@@ ingly .
especially if one compar@@ es them with current online cards .
then it becomes clear how towns and municipalities in the spread @-@ area of the Münch@@ ner Merk@@ ur have changed since the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria @-@ Atlas is a mak@@ es@@ epp@@ ing that one does not recognize as such .
in the large depart@@ ures card were found for cities and municipalities more detailed maps , so @-@ called jud@@ ging leaves .
this came into consideration according to the Bay@@ erische Staats@@ theater between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and jump over of the first Ver@@ messung of Bavaria .
your Client : Napoleon .
the French army leaders proved to be occupied since the spring of 1800 during the Second World War II .
Napoleon wants an overview of the occupied country and gave up a top@@ ographic image of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
even if the French troops mar@@ ched with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville , of February 9 , 18@@ 01 : there were the current neighb@@ ors who created the idea of a surface area of Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV . Joseph drive forward the project to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; top@@ ograph@@ ical Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and thus the Bay@@ erische Staats@@ theater . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the certificate for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and is like to find all the others on the Bay@@ erische Landes@@ bibliothek .
the comparison Früh@@ er / Today is the example of the provincial capital on the most impressive .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
an example of this is sub@@ s@@ end@@ ling that appeared in the map from 18@@ 56 still relatively isolated .
S@@ end@@ ling was introduced 21 years after creation of the map , so 1877 , as Münch@@ ner neighborhood .
today , Unter@@ s@@ end@@ ling is located in the middle of the city .
the houses under@@ lines concentrate around 18@@ 56 along today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße which was named after 1878 by Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader of the insur@@ rection of the Bav@@ arian peasants against Austria 1705 .
where today is the West@@ park , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : in the first glance : in the first glance , a smaller card with do@@ zens lines and numbers : hand@@ written num@@ bering can be derived from the so @-@ called &quot; urine &quot; from which the basic tax was derived .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there were no farmers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; small plots today &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , no farmers more - but small gar@@ dener of the plant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land in Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large green area stands out of the north of Unter@@ s@@ end@@ ling .
the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 locations of the Oktober@@ fest , was in the 19th century a meadow - and no concrete desert .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of the p@@ sychiatri@@ c medicine .
in the Ur@@ posi@@ tions@@ blatt , in the territory of the present district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen is not only the street name &quot; at the Gast@@ eig &quot; or from the peak &quot; On the ventilation &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , here on the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße , one once experienced people with ins@@ cription . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Münch@@ ner circle @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anst@@ alt &quot; On the Au@@ er Lü@@ ch . &quot;
since 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden the institution - the p@@ sychiatri@@ sts who is associated with the death of King Ludwi@@ gs II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and ended up for example the Ank@@ ets of the so @-@ called Irish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is also prohibited to apply force against the in@@ comes , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , Head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen Museum , who has engaged in an exhibition with An@@ st@@ alt .
for 280 patients had first place first , later it was expanded to 500 places .
sometime , this capacity does not cover any longer - the reason for the construction of the cycles in hair 1905 .
there since 2006 the Is@@ ar @-@ A@@ MP@@ ER @-@ Klin@@ ik@@ um München @-@ Ost , one of the largest cities in Germany .
at the A@@ real of the former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt meet young people in Munich &apos;s Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um .
Or@@ ph@@ er@@ war@@ b the complex@@ es 1920 and turned him into a youth heim with training .
west is the football field of the TS@@ V Munich east , east @-@ house dating from the 1980s .
in 2015 you set the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa don Bosco &quot; - in archit@@ ect@@ ur@@ ation to the origin of the Ir@@ ren@@ anst@@ alt , which was destroyed during World War II during the Second World War .
the Mari@@ en@@ platz was around 18@@ 56 as &quot; main square , &quot; the merch@@ ant was called &quot; Buy G@@ asse . &quot;
a decisive change brought about the Second World War in the heart of Munich .
the bom@@ bs of the Al@@ lies ris@@ sen in December 1944 many holes in the city center .
a great stayed to this day - at Mari@@ enhof .
the English Institute , Small Business sh@@ ouses and a Gru@@ ber@@ kap@@ elle from the Middle Ages were once based on Mari@@ enhof , where these days are the suburbs and on 5 April 2017 the ground@@ breaking for the second S @-@ Bahn track .
with the sli@@ ders , the old Munich map can be compared with the a@@ erial photograph of today - and the hole in Mari@@ enhof are filled .
citi@@ zenship group published travel agency for Miss@@ ouri
the National Association for the Promotion of multic@@ ol@@ ing has issued a warning for colored people who travel to Miss@@ ouri due to discrimin@@ atory policy and rac@@ ist attacks .
&quot; NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the federal state Miss@@ ouri , which will come into force until 28 August 2017 , visitors and Mis@@ sou@@ ri@@ ans will be able to bring special attention and express their first caution because a number of question@@ able , r@@ acial @-@ based pro@@ gen@@ cies occur in recent times throughout the state and described here , &quot; said it in the statement of the group .
a recent law of Miss@@ ouri , which makes it easier to win and discrimin@@ atory authorities , as well as the prosec@@ ution authorities of the state , the di@@ spro@@ por@@ tion@@ ate minorities , promp@@ ted the group to recover the arm@@ ament , said the NA@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have been inj@@ uries of civil rights that people happen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are hal@@ ted because of their skin @-@ color , they are be@@ aten or killed , &quot; said the President of Miss@@ ouri NA@@ AC@@ P , Ro@@ d Chapel , the Kan@@ sas City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such cases which we have not heard yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning that the organisation issued for a state in the United States .
the group zi@@ pped accidents such as r@@ acial ver@@ ge against black students at the University of Miss@@ ouri and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ anders died out of question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year , having had no gas@@ oline more during the journey and was taken by the police of Miss@@ ouri in cu@@ sto@@ dy without preventing a crime .
the Council also pointed to a recent report by the Office of the general prosec@@ ut@@ or of Miss@@ ouri , in which it is shown that black drivers in the state 75 percent are more common than wh@@ ites .
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Miss@@ ouri , &quot; said Chapel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people must be ready to bring your money or let the relatives know that they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miss@@ ouri awarded in 2015 100 H@@ ass@@ ad@@ ort , following the latest numbers from the H@@ ass@@ gil@@ ded Reports programme of F@@ BI , the state regarding the number of such violations on the 16th place of the country .
the travel agency is also an answer to a new Miss@@ ouri bill that would make it harder to complain a company because of housing or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union had issued the American Civil Liber@@ ties for Texas and Arizona , after the States adopted immigration authorities to susp@@ ect the local law enforcement authorities , to re@@ affir@@ m people due to immigration laws , resulting in the opinion of the AC@@ LU for further seg@@ reg@@ ation .
travel allowance are usually issued by the State Department for other countries , but in recent times , stakeholders have used the measure to respond to particular laws and trends within the USA .
Wei@@ dec@@ aun@@ ay is elementary
the her@@ edit@@ ary Wei@@ dez@@ au@@ n project is a successful project and will continue in the coming year .
the CD@@ U Par@@ li@@ ament@@ ary Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac have taken place on the spot a picture .
at the right @-@ grab@@ bing of the family Schwen@@ de@@ mann , the representatives of the her@@ b CD@@ U Local group met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MEPs .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann aff@@ ords first insights into its business , in which he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest be@@ et , 40 dairy farm and also many young animals provided and in five apartments of holiday homes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schwar@@ zw@@ al@@ d@@ mil@@ ch &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is for him the alternative mark@@ er way for the milk of his cows , pi@@ voting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the table of the guests comes only Regi@@ on@@ ales .
as he is also BL@@ HV @-@ Chairman of Fis@@ bach &apos;s fisher@@ man , he described the Wei@@ dec@@ ay project as &quot; spontaneous &quot; .
I can not manage it in this kind of steep surfaces .
the green area cares for a lot of work , much m@@ ts with the motor sense are processed .
&quot; we have to fight here with the conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; emphas@@ ised Schwen@@ de@@ mann .
in 2003 he took over the el@@ ter@@ ated operation and crops these without chemical plant protection and fer@@ til@@ is@@ ers , even if he does not run bio @-@ operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Comm@@ une has recognised the importance of the Wei@@ dec@@ eption project and is pleased with the leaders of the leader . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs of 3000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are would have to be supported by farmers .
one hope that the aff@@ o@@ rest@@ ation of the surfaces can still be moved out for a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have , are people who work in agriculture and to make thoughts on how they continue their business , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed the Mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers are often in criticism due to promoting often in criticism
over the Wei@@ dec@@ eption promotion were fenced in the year 2013 a total of 25 plots of eleven participants .
the disclosure surface is therefore 40 hectares , which can not be investigated until at least 20@@ 23 .
from the total costs in the amount of 71 500 Euro the half was funded by Leader , a quarter performed the municipality of fishermen .
thus , the farmers remained 12 610 euros , which had to invest in 16.@@ 2 km Wei@@ dez@@ au@@ n .
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; stated Schwen@@ de@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac empha@@ sized : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it does not make a really good job , without farmers and agriculture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also for Peter Weiss , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here are the best food produced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ scape of Baden @-@ Württemberg ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg allows the state promotion of the past@@ ors .
the goal is the disclosure of the Black Forest .
prerequisite is the presence of one of the L@@ PR @-@ drawn conveyor .
moreover , the enclosed area may not be tow@@ ed ( slope over 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by aff@@ o@@ rest@@ ation .
for the her@@ edit@@ ary Wei@@ dec@@ ay project 2018 , the request of eight participants are currently working with 24 plots that would like to build just under 16 kilometers of fence .
the disclosure surface corresponds to 35 hectares , the kal@@ c@@ umul@@ ated costs lie at more than 112 000 euros .
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes the Statue of Liberty .
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to att@@ acking the statues .
the Americans will appreciate these as well as any other - hence the care@@ free fall of Saddam H@@ uss@@ one at the Fir@@ dos Square in B@@ agh@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the ump @-@ regime , certainly knew what he did when he did a symbolic struggle with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N on the proposals of the President to the dr@@ astic restriction of the legal migration with the Statue of Liberty .
to stay fair , Miller did not get the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of jet@@ ties and Liberty Im@@ it@@ ators would have suffered him if he had done it .
but he attacked their meaning , and in particular the importance that you have been written , when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to its base .
as Miller A@@ co@@ sta en@@ pf@@ te : &quot; I want to go here not to a complete thing about story , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world .
the poem to which you relate to later was added and not part of the original freedom of Liberty . &quot;
Miller is know@@ led@@ geable right , but as he himself formulated it , it is not really about history .
it is about the contemporary response to the asc@@ ension &apos;s words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state not only invites any ancient immigrants , but the poorest nations : &quot; your fatigue , your poor , / thy ow@@ ning masses who lon@@ ging for , free to breathe , / the miser@@ able fall of thy rich co@@ asts . &quot;
there was never a time when the &quot; el@@ der Ab@@ fall &quot; was better to see on our screens .
Miller committed himself to liter@@ ary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ umps USA .
this conflict due to the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural engagement : it is in fact a conflict around the importance of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who campa@@ ign@@ ed to place their words after their death on the basis - knew very well that they completed a highly political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American Republi@@ can@@ ism by showing in an un@@ used classical picture depic@@ ting the feminine em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in their poem the female figure is no longer abstract - it has obtained a voice .
and she herself is a completely different name : mother of the ex@@ il@@ ant .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist cou@@ p and a devast@@ ating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just like Lazarus the importance of the statue changed , people wanted to switch from the right wing this for a long time .
the big scre@@ aming of the Rush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , was argu@@ ed a kind of John the Baptist for the coming from Tr@@ ump , argu@@ ed 2010 that the Statue of Liberty nobody to enter , but rather an early Ne@@ o@@ conserv@@ ative that the American flame goes into the um@@ ph@@ oned world : &quot; Lady Liberty is proceeding .
it is supposed to carry the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch should not be the way to the United States . &quot;
quite unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh here on something crossed .
the importance of the statue is quite and certainly a question of the perception of the perception .
the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus consi@@ sted to see them as they had seen by the exhaus@@ tive , miser@@ able , but hop@@ eless people after long and often terrible trips on the de@@ cks of ships had been seen .
it is in the tru@@ est sense to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refu@@ ge and a chance to improve their lives .
her statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome that they have to hear .
and of course this is not the perspective that you ever want to recognise Miller and tr@@ ump .
their tor@@ ch should not be enlighten@@ ed , but the hat@@ red , who is their only source of power , ign@@ ite .
world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black lo@@ bt Scot@@ tish members of the United Kingdom
E@@ ili@@ ie Do@@ yle remin@@ ds of a time when only two bu@@ cks of the Great Britain belonged to the team of Great Britain .
the executive director of the ath@@ le@@ tics of the United Kingdom , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ piece sch@@ ot@@ tic quot@@ a quot@@ a quot@@ a has made a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of sch@@ ot@@ tic Ath@@ l@@ eten was selected for London 2017 , which starts on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Scotland something special develops &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the ath@@ le@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome we and we try to understand and we will continue to find out until we find it &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talk to people in the Scot@@ tish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scot@@ tish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British ath@@ le@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scot@@ tish athletes , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - which will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah upon the 5.000 m track , while E@@ ili@@ dh Do@@ yle was chosen by the crew to the team captain .
&quot; E@@ ili@@ ie is quite mod@@ est .
their surrender &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a series of athletes , whether they were sh@@ ot@@ table or where they live or train , went out of space and felt very proud and were very motivated .
the passion and the real feel that E@@ ili@@ ie seemed entirely of course , were great . &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth @-@ Silber@@ med@@ a@@ ill@@ en@@ rap@@ per , which is seen at their fifth world Championships at the 400 @-@ m hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; unbeliev@@ able &quot; that 16 vill@@ i are in the British crew .
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championships was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
the Mu@@ ir @-@ run@@ ners Mu@@ ir leads on this way and has been placed in five British and two European rec@@ orders in the past year .
it will take part in the 1,@@ 500 m and the 5,000 m rounds .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,@@ 500 m is another Scot@@ tish , which one should be observed after a great season , which should be the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games .
Do@@ yle re@@ members its first World Championships as the only other Scot@@ sman in Team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell .
the Mann@@ ing Cap@@ itals says that they are &quot; enormous proud of &quot; on the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots do not only belong to the team , but in some cases , even with the medals and in the fin@@ als .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the special thing about it was chosen by the other members of the team , so it was anyway great honor to know , but to know that my team members have voted for me and chose to make it something very special for me , &quot; she added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the r@@ ots that belong to the team .
it shows only how far we have come .
and they are here as an established ath@@ l@@ eten , athletes , who want to rise on po@@ ison .
what are my speech concerned as a captain ?
yes , I think it went well .
I just pointed out that in this situation we are very happy because we have a home World Championship .
it is therefore really important to put on these hom@@ ily support and benefit from it that we are back at the Olympiastadion .
I be@@ got a second chance to go there and compete and it will just be so a great atmosphere out there . &quot;
blocking of critics on Facebook : give not a public ministry if you cannot wear the immigration of voters
the father of our land knew something of bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it didn &apos;t take long before the newspapers sm@@ ote him because of the internal policy as far as its political principles .
he sh@@ ear@@ ed in criticism , safe .
but he did not put his critics to silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for in the year 17@@ 83 said Washington , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stu@@ pid , and st@@ um@@ m we will be guided by the sheep on the slau@@ ghter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this brings me to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry H@@ og@@ an who has to work to be more like Washington .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; testi@@ gan@@ s have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on his official Facebook page . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union def@@ endant him on this occasion in the beginning of this week .
the rod of the Gover@@ nor did the law@@ suit than fri@@ v@@ ol , and the online comment was full of a bac@@ kl@@ ash with &quot; Na , and ? &quot;
&quot; it is just Facebook , &quot; said many people .
but it is important .
and it is particularly important when it is a type of H@@ og@@ an .
this is a re@@ publi@@ can@@ arian govern@@ or in a overwhelming democratic state that is amazing .
he has the two @-@ ur@@ red approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a reactionary hat@@ ch .
he has shown a fixed hand in the guidance of his state and strict observ@@ ance of the principles .
he was also very sk@@ ill@@ ful to use Facebook as primary means to connect with his voters and to debate his ha@@ ar@@ less head after chem@@ otherapy in his side .
therefore the block@@ age of persons who come to the page of the Govern@@ ors - that is a public forum that is officially stated as officially and by employees that are paid with public tax @-@ Dollars - un@@ necessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gan@@ s Spre@@ cher@@ in Am@@ elia , Ch@@ asse , the actions of the govern@@ ors and argu@@ ed that the block of comments is nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to use the image of TRO@@ LLE@@ ON or sp@@ amm@@ ers or h@@ amm@@ ed people that vibr@@ ate online the wh@@ ip .
the post spoke with some of the real people that were blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
and these are just real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , a business@@ man and a past@@ or , no trou@@ bles .
they all told that their comments were respect@@ ful , thought@@ ful and not prof@@ ess .
the past@@ or c@@ ited the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gan@@ s Catholic faith .
Law@@ y@@ tin Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani by Bo@@ wie , MD . , was not h@@ ated , but she asked for h@@ ass@@ ay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I commented that I was disappointed , there was no reaction to h@@ ass@@ ay and other latest news , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote them in the commentary area of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not appreciate this idea if a number of people at the same level takes position , then they are considered to be more rather than a so @-@ called collective action and is not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the employees of the Gover@@ nor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would probably call the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inter@@ c@@ ession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook @-@ era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocked a cri@@ tic or deleted a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in earlier times when you have done the same that staff were sent to collect newspapers with critical lad@@ ders and burn or to finish demonstr@@ ators or to get prot@@ esters .
but precisely this is exactly digital .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public official , who is cri@@ tici@@ zed for it that he considers fac@@ ulties and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is indic@@ ted by Twitter @-@ users , which were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question was last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County decre@@ ed the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. District Court James C. Cach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when they called a voters from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Be@@ vin ( R ) also received a visit from the AC@@ LU due to its use of Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so difficult .
at the moment Washington had the time of affordable gh@@ etto a similar effect like the Internet .
the number of newspapers multiplied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous brief@@ ing sm@@ ote on his leadership .
and even at that time Washington was anonymous troll@@ s .
the people , the pseu@@ don@@ y@@ me like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; Valeri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; used , wrote all letters to newspapers , the Wash@@ ing@@ tons decisions made down .
peti@@ tions which also cri@@ tici@@ zed its position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and navigation with the United Kingdom , according to the historic documents collected by the Online Pap@@ ers of George Washington Project .
but he did not put them to silence .
freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses belong to the basis of our nation .
and true leadership means to accept this .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for the home comforts at the Renaissance Club
the former Europeans No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for the next three days on home comforts as the Renaissance Club in East Loth@@ ian is organized the 25th edition of Scot@@ tish Senior Open .
Nor@@ di@@ re , who conducted it next year on the Ar@@ cher@@ field Links to En@@ dr@@ unde , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales and func@@ tioned as a tournament @-@ partner in the name of the company &apos;s founders and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; I have seen how the ren@@ aissance club was built , and we see how he reaches his fame with this event , &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the players will see this course from its best , he is in a great condition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jerry made a great job when he laid down this place .
he is an eag@@ erly advoc@@ ate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
the Engl@@ ish@@ man &apos;s opinion is looking forward to defend a master@@ y for the first time , although he won in his 32 @-@ year career with both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour .
&quot; this really feels particularly true , &quot; said that in South@@ port , heated players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have not been able to defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open , as it was in the year after I had won them out of the program . &quot; &quot; &quot;
back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories of last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year here .
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate . &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50@@ th birthday , returns to the action at home .
this event will be its first sch@@ ot@@ tical performance since the Aber@@ de@@ en Asset Management Scot@@ tish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a little bit more if you &apos;re playing home , &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh .

in the past two decades less people have died due to passive exposure to lung cancer .
for this result , scientists of the University hospitals in Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) came in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates a year 167 pul@@ mon@@ ary cre@@ atively attributed to passive smoke &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the manager Hei@@ ko Mu@@ g . &quot; &quot; &quot;

pet@@ als prove to be very complex
the construction work in the Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &apos; lie less in the time , &quot; so the leader of the Bau@@ werk Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the field of household connections , the situation is more complicated than susp@@ ected , as in the underground much conce@@ al , which was not noted in the plans .
the traffic , which is repeat@@ ed@@ ged again the construction work , represents a big problem for the construction ru@@ d@@ pp of the company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; the Ig@@ nor@@ ance of the drivers in front of red lights and sp@@ err@@ ity is already enormous , &quot; declared Hein@@ ze .

poverty and death in the Indonesian Gold country
when Bar@@ dina Deg@@ ei the dinner coo@@ ks , she uses no coo@@ ker .
it even uses rarely a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ ent@@ age in the un@@ quiet Indonesian province Pap@@ ua , presents the house@@ wife normally a sweet pot@@ ato - locally as &quot; Not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace .
after half an hour the res@@ hol@@ low bu@@ ol@@ le will be taken with eag@@ erly , un@@ washed hands and se@@ ated .
Deg@@ ei sits on the clay o@@ des - it has no furniture - where they also performs their daily work , e.g. gar@@ ments with dr@@ illed water from the nearby sum@@ p to wash .
a bucket in a hom@@ eless space serves as a lat@@ ine .

Poly@@ gam@@ ie is common here .
of course , late one can work dangerous : most vill@@ men are un@@ employed and many drink heavily , and there are here the soldiers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody che@@ ating it , after 5 p.m. in the village , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 after a contro@@ versi@@ al referendum in Indonesia as only 1,0@@ 26 m@@ ori@@ zed by a public ho@@ stages prior to the crew .
an existing movement that stir@@ red up an existing movement that turned up rapidly against the government of Jak@@ arta , which holds control of the region and exclu@@ de foreign journalists or legal observ@@ ations of it .
in 2003 the province became officially distributed in Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , with the independent part of Pap@@ ua New gu@@ ine@@ as .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as sec@@ lu@@ ded as it ö@@ de . the journey includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from provincial capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a mor@@ dial 5 @-@ hour drive with the car .
there is no public transport .

there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not able to wear these clothing , &quot; says Deg@@ ei and indicates on their lively , hand@@ ful tur@@ ban , their Dark Hem@@ d and her bright rock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier we only had sheets on our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pap@@ ua is Indonesian province , where 28 % of the people live under the poverty @-@ border and some of the worst nur@@ mort@@ ality and pl@@ ot@@ ene betra@@ y in Asia .
but it is also Indonesian Gold .
the biggest and most profitable gold mine from the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is just 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high country provincial in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 residents .
in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort has reduced the value of 3,@@ 1 billion US dollars and copper .
in addition , Pap@@ ua has wood &apos;s natural resources valued valued 78 billion US dollars .
these rich@@ es are however a source of mis@@ ery for the Pap@@ ua to make sure that Indonesian military has preserved a long @-@ bearing presence .
an examination from 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort paid local military units and units between 1998 and 2004 almost 20 million US dollars , including up to 15@@ 0,000 US dollars to a single officer .
Pap@@ u@@ an claims based on greater autonomy threat@@ ens this golden go@@ ose , and becoming more gn@@ less .
according to the activi@@ sts of activi@@ sts , more than 500@@ ,000 Pap@@ ua have been killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed since 1969 by the Indonesian military , tor@@ tured and de@@ tained .
mass@@ ages in Pap@@ u@@ as Stamm@@ es@@ hoch@@ land in the 1970 @-@ he years have been referred to in accordance with the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission for gen@@ oci@@ de .
in the region alone the Indonesian police last year more than 3.@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; we can lose all , &quot; said it in a report of the arch@@ di@@ oc@@ ese Bris@@ bane from the year 2016 , in which reports on atro@@ cities and torture - rap@@ e and electro@@ des are particularly popular after another report - and brut@@ al pre@@ cip@@ itation peaceful demonstrations .
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims because every week black@@ outs , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia @-@ resear@@ cher for Human Rights Watch .
the screws are reinforced , as Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring an influ@@ x of settl@@ ers from other parts of Indonesian .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is at 83 % Christian , but demo@@ graphic development is changing as Muslim economic migrants from the pop@@ ulated islands Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ aw@@ esi .

the Indonesian State President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , in folk and as Jok@@ ow@@ i known , spoke during his election campaign to tackle the ine@@ qualities and the infring@@ ements in Pap@@ ua .
the former car@@ p@@ enter , 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Pap@@ ua has changed little , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts were broken because we voted &quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the expect@@ ation that he will fulfill our hopes that the righteousness is restored &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says You . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai was involved only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is inaugur@@ ation in October .
on December 7 , 2014 a group of 11 kids outside and sang christ@@ mas before a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indonesian soldiers on a motorcycle by the dark .
the trou@@ bled children told them that they should switch their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers took a breach of her tone and later came back with four soldiers , so the local past@@ or Y@@ av@@ edt T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers , the dr@@ unk , ch@@ aired , and sm@@ ote the group with their gun , spoke victims and witness .
then sco@@ red one of the soldiers to the group of children .
a child , the 16 @-@ year Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so heavily defe@@ ated that he fell into the Com@@ a .
a few hours later the building of the nearby government Commission was set on fire and escal@@ ate things next day .
about 1,000 young pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered themselves together on a football ground before the local police station and the military comm@@ and@@ o@@ centre to demand justice .
they carried by cerem@@ onial Jag@@ ev@@ o@@ gen and led the Wa@@ ita @-@ dance - in the circle constantly and a scar@@ s@@ wan im@@ it@@ ating - by Pap@@ u@@ as mee P@@ ago @-@ tribe before .
some prot@@ esters began cut@@ ters on police and military po@@ inters .
when the mood was heated , the soldiers got a command over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses do more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; said it in an official document of TI@@ ME , which has not been released by local media .
Y@@ er@@ emi@@ as Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatened danger and called upon peace and called for the amount to return home .
nobody was listening in the mood .
&quot; when I turned myself , I suddenly shot in my lin@@ kes hand@@ wr@@ ist , &quot; he told TI@@ ME on the porch of his colour@@ ful wooden house .
Kay@@ ame is still not yet who has fallen , but says that the ball came from among the ranks of the people gathered together .
&quot; it was over@@ crowded , many shots were fi@@ red , &quot; he adds .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was taken three times , so his c@@ ous@@ in , the witness of the shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran@@ ged to him and studied his body to make sure he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who bears as many Indonesian just a name , the TI@@ ME in d@@ ü@@ ster@@ er mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw that he was dead ... I have k@@ iss@@ ed him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Che@@ ese spec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , told re@@ por@@ ters that his officers would only want to secure their station &quot; just because they are attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves when people face to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spok@@ es@@ person of the Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others have been wo@@ unded .
the news about the k@@ ill@@ ings arrived only on the following day &quot; fil@@ tered &quot; to Jak@@ arta .
three weeks Jok@@ ow@@ i kept Jok@@ ow@@ i in Jay@@ ap@@ ura a passionate speech in which he has been sympath@@ etic to the families of victims and sw@@ aying the historic mis@@ sil@@ es in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want that this case will immediately be solved , so that in future it will no longer happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
security of the security gu@@ anto said in October 2016 that he was held an external mechanism for the use of historic human rights violations .
but the talk began almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the injury are caused long ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were in the 90 &apos;s and early 2000 @-@ s .
the point is that we have committed ourselves to approach these violations , but there are trials that must under@@ go through , &quot; he said .
then the Wir@@ anto did a withdrawal when he spoke on June 5th in Jak@@ arta with TI@@ ME and said , he did not have plans to establish a complaint mechanism .
instead , &quot; everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wir@@ anto , which has been indic@@ ted by the UN for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said that 11 cases of human rights violations occur in Pap@@ ua had already been laid , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims took their claim with gri@@ ev@@ ous un@@ believers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was inter@@ viewed in the last three years , but there was no progress &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear later .
&quot; I am afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am afraid to be arrested by the military , be afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeat the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says that he was be@@ aten by the military after he saved four of the victims .
&quot; after I buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military sought to me , &quot; he says .
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police on vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
during a con@@ frontation between the ro@@ omm@@ ates and the manager of an B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma that ref@@ used to bring an un@@ conscious man into hospital , died one person and 17 others were wo@@ unded , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was dr@@ unk , when he f@@ ished in a nearby river , died on the way to hospital .
abandoned vill@@ agers prot@@ esting in front of the sit@@ ing office of the company .
the police said that the vill@@ agers stones arose on officers , who re@@ acted by war@@ ts of war@@ ts .
but native people say that the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade ( Indonesian par@@ am@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot the crowd and killed a killing .
&quot; we were so in panic , we have fear that there will be reven@@ ge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year Dom@@ ing@@ gu Badi@@ i who was in the proximity of the hospital , and witness was , as the last one has been delivered quickly , so the TI@@ ME .
&quot; I hidden my house two days in my house . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called for bringing the officials to account and withdraw the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade of the police from the territory . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a glorious moment for the Indonesian government .
the lack of sensu@@ al development strength@@ ens the dis@@ satisfaction of the Chief Executive Army , Mon@@ i , Dani and Dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua .
many adh@@ ered to the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) to defend the rebel@@ lion , which claims to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua , by em@@ a@@ ing spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and dism@@ iss@@ ors of Indonesian soldiers .
some of the top @-@ O@@ PM guides come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ o@@ ya .
in response to these years , thousands of people were arrested in Pan@@ i@@ ai in recent years and taken in prison , under the pre@@ text of &quot; securing national sovereignty . &quot;
some will never dive again .
among the people of Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , for@@ getting place . &quot;
poverty strength@@ ens the dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice , which is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is expensive for locals .
bread is just as apart .
the people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf .
agriculture is the task of women who can deal with four or five fields of sweet pot@@ ato .
they keep the bulk of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces not@@ a precious only 10,000 in@@ don@@ esian ru@@ pe@@ en ( 75 C@@ ents ) .
over time , economic ine@@ qualities have grown between the native Pap@@ ua and the new migrants that have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new floo@@ ds towards the airport of Nab@@ ire .
the few jobs that exist in the region are usually to the better educated and prosp@@ erous migrants .
Pap@@ ua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to lead their own businesses competitive .
&quot; the young people are not keen to stay in the village ... for there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the tri@@ es@@ man of Pan@@ i@@ ai .
isolation holds the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
in addition , restrictions of the reporting of international media will be ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year , the French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ die and Bas@@ ille Long@@ cham@@ p were de@@ ported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although to give them the rare permission to the films .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the Dep@@ uty Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is elect@@ oral campaign to raise the limitations of reporting to transparency and development , not realised .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new threats to foreign journalists who are trying to report from Indonesian f@@ enc@@ e@@ ast@@ ern@@ most provinces of Pap@@ ua and West@@ pap@@ ua . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lack of freedom of the press is that the international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March , six paci@@ f@@ ishes , Nau@@ mb@@ als , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , die Mar@@ sh@@ all@@ in@@ seln and the Sal@@ om@@ onen @-@ Islands - the UN Human Rights Council to examine the &quot; different and widespread violations &quot; in Pap@@ ua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have historically been watching the O@@ PM .
the spok@@ es@@ person of the Indian State of Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r dism@@ iss@@ ed the pre@@ sp@@ outs of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia , there is still a democratic system , and there is free media so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights . &quot;
people on the ground want to take note of more foreign governments .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , conducted under the direction of the human right of the Her@@ ees K@@ ees Van B@@ aar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura on 4th May visited her silence and than@@ ked him , &quot; We want freedom , &quot; in accordance with a source that would also participate in the meeting , but anonymous .
Indonesia has another presidential election , but the Pap@@ ua said that they will probably not be right again for Jok@@ ow@@ i .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai &apos;s rivers , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the Chief Council .
he wants that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from that it is under the constant threat of a rob@@ ber@@ ish military , lives in arm@@ ament and health services .
Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; gu@@ ilt &quot; must be rep@@ ay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the threats and in@@ timi@@ dation families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ Sch@@ uss@@ ets led a last symbolic act of the Trot@@ sky@@ ists : the ly@@ re of a sacri@@ ficial was buried in a terrain exactly with the police and the military station .
they know they might never give justice to them , but at least they do not leave those responsible for their crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with healthy head . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos;s skyscr@@ apers of Dubai for the second time
a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest residential towers of the world in Dubai to fle@@ e its account and two hundred inhabitants , from the 337 m high , 79 @-@ sto@@ rey building .
it is the second fire that is called in just two years by the Hoch@@ haus which one is called zu@@ fal@@ sely the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el tower ) .
the building was ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ated , injury have not been reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; we slept and we were up with fire alarm and scre@@ aming the people .
we ran@@ ned the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come from the 50@@ th floor down , &quot; told a resident , who re@@ side his name as George &apos;s Reu@@ ters .
Du@@ ba@@ is civilian authorities said that the units of fire fighting at 4.00 am local time ( 00@@ .00 pm GMT ) the fire ext@@ ingu@@ ished and the building ab@@ ended .
the government said it works on the provision of accommodation for the persons concerned .
the incident can answer questions about the safety of materials used in outside areas of skyscr@@ apers all over the world .
a study conducted by the management of the Tor@@ ch @-@ building after its brand in 2015 , that the largest part of the damage from the cl@@ adding , the outdoor clothing , to decor@@ ating or insulation , came .
in the UK the police told them that the system of plates for insulation and cl@@ adding to the London @-@ fur @-@ tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a bran@@ ding at which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Court of tennis ( IT@@ F ) has passed through his great Davis Cup Cou@@ p at the AG@@ M .
at the meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h city was supported by this sport @-@ revolutionary proposal , Davis Cup single , only to play two pay@@ ers , Hau@@ b@@ thin not supported by the required two @-@ third @-@ majority .
the most often very long , but even so very sc@@ at@@ ched fifth set @-@ classics remain with the tradition str@@ ils .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 percent of member countries agreed for reform , the target of the IT@@ F president David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only slightly missing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to ensure the long @-@ term future of these ic@@ onic and historical competitions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one will continue to work to improve the applic@@ ant .
at all , not only for the vote was already before the proposal before , the proposal began to apply the finale at a neutral place .
new from 2018 are only compar@@ atively small details : so the fin@@ alists are in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will have the right to host the host in the first round .
to reduce the costs of the organ@@ iser , the requirements for training courses etc. are facilit@@ ated and the players will have to complete less official media dates before the Davis Cup .
more than 1 of 5 US travelers produces forbidden objects into the plane , finds a survey
a survey conducted among air passengers , that more than 20 percent are fully aware or un@@ conscious objects to the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent , who frau@@ dul@@ ent the aircraft , while they bore them , or other objects with blades .
less than 1 per cent all@@ eged , they would have discovered that they have traveled ir@@ r@@ tu@@ ally with sh@@ aking weapons , amm@@ o or explosive charges .
the survey with more than 1,000 people - provided by a jet charter service , the Strat@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , performed - also fixed that younger travellers are more dis@@ regarded the rules .
the respon@@ dents that they have taken care of having tried to fly with something that were bann@@ ed by T@@ SA were 19,@@ 7 percent Mill@@ enni@@ als , compared to less than 15 percent , members of the X were .
the most common objects , which were prescribed by T@@ SA @-@ agent , were foods and liquids .
more than 3 percent have said to have s@@ wis@@ ely worn by the safety control , whereas 2.2 percent of the female bur@@ in@@ quired and 3,@@ 7 percent of the male in@@ quired also confirmed that they were int@@ enti@@ onal ver@@ ot@@ ene drugs brought into the plane .
the company said , I asked travelers throughout the country to find out how many for@@ s@@ sm@@ ug@@ gling were brought by the airport security and how many things were visi@@ bly done .
it is no surprise that people , the most frequently sm@@ ug@@ gling - know@@ ingly or ignor@@ ant - by the security bear those who were most often fly .
however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are a little complicated and conf@@ using .
the people are often un@@ certain that liquids are allowed to take them or how much of it .
so it is no surprise that the largest quantity of the m@@ ould are conf@@ isc@@ ated items in the T@@ SA .
a time for the people , the T@@ SA could see books as sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ware .
liquids are permitted on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k is not equal : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la @-@ customers
E @-@ thous@@ end@@ s@@ assa El@@ on Mus@@ k are happy to have a huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
so far , he has so far under@@ scor@@ ing that some of the customers have already returned its non @-@ binding reservation .
in addition to the always tri@@ um@@ ph@@ ant numbers to increase sales and even gig@@ antic er@@ aim is Tes@@ la @-@ Chef El@@ on Mus@@ k at the announcement of the recent quar@@ terly assessment for the first time a different , less gl@@ itter@@ ing numbers : the cancell@@ ations in the new mass market @-@ model 3 .
Mus@@ k has often worked with the more than 500@@ ,000 cav@@ ity for the new car in the past few months , whose delivery begins .
now M@@ ish@@ t : from the total of 5@@ 18.@@ 000 in@@ spec@@ tions 6@@ 3,000 have already been with@@ drawn .
critics have always pointed out that it is merely a non @-@ binding reservations .
in case of cancellation is paid Tes@@ la the 1000 euro ( in the US $ 1000 US dollars and in the United Kingdom 1000 pounds ) &quot; reservation payment has been fully back .
currently , 45@@ ,000 of such non @-@ binding reservations , , Sp@@ te Mus@@ k in a telephone conference with analy@@ st .
that the cancellation of up to 14 percent of all orders may be made to the problem , the Tes@@ la Chef does not believe .
its argument : the challenge of ambitious growth rates are not in demand but on the production site .
in the past year Tes@@ la 8@@ 4,000 cars delivered .
2018 It shall be - all models assembled - 500@@ ,000 , by 2020 one million .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , there are only 1800 reservations for this day .
those who ordered a &quot; Model 3 &quot; should be ordered at the earliest in the second half of 2018 with the delivery - if Tes@@ la it creates its brand @-@ new , never in practice tested production roads without greater inter@@ rup@@ tions with maximum utilization .
many experts dou@@ bling that this is possible .
however it comes to larger del@@ ays , then the non @-@ binding effect of the reservation might be a problem for Tes@@ la .
for then , the company can not prevent un@@ satisfied customers to d@@ ough in Sch@@ aren .

he did not mentioned the l@@ ament , which was raised against his previous place in a Federal occupation .
it is about a time limit , which ran on the 1st of October for states to keep the standards of 2015 for bott@@ len@@ ght o@@ zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pru@@ itt will be announced in June that he will delay in compliance with a year to study the Plan and avoid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in local decisions or economic growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pru@@ itt , who was in front of his appointment through President Donald Tr@@ ump State attorney of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma was a long time a reliable opponent in@@ sti@@ g@@ ated environmental regulations .
since his arrival in Washington , Pru@@ t has been re@@ affir@@ med to block or delay , regulations to block or delay the chemical industry and industry of fos@@ sil fuels .
the su@@ dden re@@ conversion from Wednesday is the latest legal back for the Pru@@ dential roll@@ back Agenda .
last month has decided for a Federal occupation of Washington in Washington that the E@@ PA Dec@@ ker has exceeded its authority as he tried , the implementation of a rule of Obama administration , the oil and gas company for monitoring and reduction of meth@@ an@@ lec@@ eb@@ ries .
in an on Mit@@ tw@@ och@@ re statement , Pru@@ itt suggested that his turn@@ around at Oz@@ on@@ standards easily explained the willingness of E@@ PA to cooperate with the states by the complex process of timely performance of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under previous administration , E@@ PA is often not adh@@ ered to the deadlines for execution , then to be charged by activi@@ sts and others , and in an agreement reached the date for execution , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Pru@@ itt , who used the E@@ PA more than a do@@ zen time in its previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation through judicial proceedings , and we take deadlines . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we also take the law and authority that gives us serious . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the opinion of the E@@ PA that you will eventually use his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; authority for delay and all other legal available &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure that the rules &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is based on solid policies and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the re@@ public@@ ans in the Congress are pushing for a far @-@ reaching new version of the o@@ zone .
a bill for the last month of approved legislation is to delay the implementation of the rules of 2015 at least eight years .
the measure was not yet made in the Senate .
the New York General @-@ state @-@ attorney Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who held the coalition of the States which had been indic@@ ted the E@@ PA at this week , said the Group intended to uph@@ old the legal pres@@ sures .
&quot; conversion of E@@ PA - according to our suits - is an important gain for health and safety of these 6,@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and those over 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g which flows into their con@@ greg@@ ations . &quot;
new York is located in this case California , Connec@@ tic@@ ut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Maine , Massachusetts , Min@@ nes@@ ota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ sy@@ l@@ van@@ ien , Rho@@ de Island , Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
floor @-@ Oz@@ on arises , when poll@@ ut@@ ants from cars , power plants , oil @-@ sh@@ iel@@ ding , chemical plants and other sources are able to react in the atmosphere on sunlight .
the low smo@@ g can cause serious breathing difficulties in sensitive groups of people , and each year will contribute to thousands of premature deaths .
representatives of public health and the environ@@ ment@@ alists vote on the Pru@@ dential change of change .
&quot; it is trou@@ bled how much pressure it takes to preserve this reasonable step from the responsible for the protection of air that we inhal@@ e said , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Diversity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to continue fighting against the ide@@ ological cr@@ us@@ ade of the ump government to adapt to environmental poll@@ ut@@ ants and their particular interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tum@@ ble celeb@@ rates 750 years St. Hil@@ arius @-@ Church
750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the Berg@@ kirche is hosted on the old cemetery @-@ A@@ real in Tum@@ lingen on Sunday , 16th July , at 16.@@ 30 clock to a Seren@@ ade .
whether its idyl@@ lic location and beautiful view of the village is the historical St. Hil@@ arius facility a popular place to stay .
the visitors of the Six@@ th Bene@@ ath @-@ Seren@@ ade may be ench@@ anted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village , the friends and suppor@@ ter of Tum@@ lin@@ gens have made their concerns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Walter Martini stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a unique village centre . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 12@@ 67 , the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was mentioned for the first time in the Wur@@ ttemberg berg@@ hic Ur@@ ur@@ buch : Graf Hermann von Sul@@ z and the Vog@@ t Eber@@ hard by Hor@@ w and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver .
the wording of the certificate according to the Tum@@ linger mountain is also a glori@@ fied farm in which the church or the patron saint has belonged to the church or the patron saint .
there are also people there .
as from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt of 18@@ 58 , was beside the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which today in the centre of Tum@@ bes are just to be recognized , the &quot; Berg &quot; of the third , the magnificent settl@@ ers of the village .
ancient cards from the time around 1600 under@@ lined these historical conditions .
the patron saint was created from the early medieval equity .
a gent@@ leman who built a church , moved and occupied with a past@@ or , remained the owner of this church and could also inher@@ it this peculi@@ ar .
associated with it was the right to use a past@@ or or to propose a new priest to the bishop .
three alt@@ ars there were in the church and two bells at the tower .
the biggest of the two zer@@ bar@@ st at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell led then for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be released later during the Second World War in 1942 .
in the 30 @-@ year war ( 16@@ 16 @-@ 16@@ 48 ) , the window panels were introduced and the bell parts were st@@ olen .
the roof was un@@ tight .
17@@ 96 enc@@ amped French troops near the church .
they were pul@@ led out the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
remains of the Church threat@@ ens 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery was also served as the last rest@@ ra@@ fts@@ men for the dead from the cor@@ rup@@ tions .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was expanded and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche abandoned .
just the cherry @-@ tower you can stand .
in the New Year sn@@ acht 18@@ 34 , a storm the storm and half cr@@ ashed .
to avoid a hurt , the tower was ab@@ broken .
only the existing tur@@ m@@ z@@ wer@@ g today remained as a witness of the 750 year old church history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; today , Horst K@@ all@@ en@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schaff@@ @-@ Rent@@ meister &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn the Hil@@ arius system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the organ@@ iser invite the friends and sponsors of Tum@@ lin@@ gens on Sunday , 16th July , the sixth Seren@@ ade on the old cemetery to the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle .
this is designed by the Com@@ bo of Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymn@@ asi@@ an Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with the papers of Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Matt@@ ei .
Local Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann speaks the final word .
the program starts at 16.@@ 30 pm .
entrance is from 15.@@ 30 pm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the finale of the Seren@@ ade , a p@@ endant in front of the cemetery takes place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with a wide view over meadows towards the forest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organis@@ ers represent the fantastic view . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Seren@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
the organis@@ ers hopes for many suppor@@ ter of the preservation of historical St. Hil@@ arius machinery , which is of significance for Tum@@ lingen and the sound of s@@ quir@@ ers .
the friends and suppor@@ ter of Tum@@ lin@@ gens are particularly committed to the home care as Seren@@ ade organizer Walter Martini reiter@@ ated .
association wants to review approval of Win@@ d@@ ams
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim weak@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not see legal pre@@ conditions for the construction and therefore has turned towards the Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim aw@@ aches itself &quot; has promp@@ ted Land@@ Council Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to withdraw his authorization for the establishment of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette .
it is illegal .
the association argu@@ ed that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 at the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette could not have been approved at all , since at the time in Vi@@ ers@@ en only passed on the border to Schwal@@ m@@ tal a wind power concentration zone .
within this concentr@@ ator area , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , at the same time the concentration zone is about exp@@ ul@@ sion of wind turbines for the remaining urban area .
such zones are supposed to avoid a &quot; saving &quot; of the landscape .
the city of Vi@@ ers@@ en had a second wind @-@ concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , but had not approved the District government in Düsseldorf , because of a form@@ fault .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the lack of planning @-@ legal prere@@ quis@@ ites , the given authorization is still ref@@ uted , and therefore with@@ draws , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , president of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of affairs : the town hall initiated before the summer break down the wind @-@ concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette ; an approval of the District government is still standing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is at this point the re@@ distribution of a permit for the creation of wind turbines are legally excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the invitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letter has entered the circle of Vi@@ ers@@ en since last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated a spok@@ es@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes them to the occasion to prove the matter again .
but they do not expect it to be stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with a view to ongoing proceedings at the Court of Directors , the circle on Thursday did not express their contents to the argum@@ entation of the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the NEW Re , one Sub@@ si@@ diary of the NEW , is planning on an area at the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ets building four per 200 meters high winds .
already last year , the company had participated in which the city of Vi@@ ers@@ en is involved , p@@ ei@@ vers with the owner of approximately 65 hectares of great schol@@ ars .
with the establishment of the four wind turbines , the electricity demand of around 11 400 households can be covered - this corresponds to approximately a five @-@ fifth of all four households .
the NEW Re wants to invest around 20 million euros .
in the last summer of Vi@@ ers@@ en City Council started green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at Wind@@ park Lin@@ ni@@ ch near Aachen , as well as a participation in a wind turbines in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district of Hein@@ sberg .

city and dealers plan &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; -@@ weekend
the city of Bad Langen@@ sal@@ za@@ ars and people from the region should re@@ discover places of shopping in the city center in September .
the commercial association and the city management do not want to use the weekend on 8th and 9th of September to lo@@ osen the local inhabitants of shopping .
as the president of the profession , Christian König , announced , the &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; is to sensi@@ tise the customers for it , which offers its own city away from the usual supermarket @-@ goods .
planned a market with regional suppliers , similar to the weekends .
in addition , local companies are to present themselves with their educational properties .
in addition , the stores of the city centre are to invite to the &quot; Mid@@ night sh@@ opp@@ en . &quot;
in doing so , the action is not only in the inhabitants of the city and the closer region .
in preparation and commerci@@ als in the radio , an internet @-@ video and printed bag , which point to the Ak@@ tions weekend , so Christian König .
city management and commercial club co@@ operated with the Chamber of Commerce and Commerce .
in this way , the trade association and the city go into another stage of the project &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive downtown . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these include new deals such as the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Active Day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Brun@@ nen@@ fest together with its commercial and hosts in order to take part in active participation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
attractive offers on Saturday and the zi@@ cht on parking costs on this day are part of the concept .
customers are also to be re @-@ connected to customer potential or again .
these include spa guests and tourists .
but also many local people would have lost the city center while shopping out of view .
in the end , all of them can contribute to in@@ vigor@@ ate the inner city - through to land@@ lords , the businesses of the whole city and associations .
it suffered , having a network the Le@@ th@@ ar@@ gie to overcome , which was partly multiplied , had said the king in the spring .
Birgit Stre@@ ich , Leit@@ ress of the I@@ HK @-@ Centers in Mühl@@ hausen dealt with that the first third &quot; home &quot; home @-@ shopping centre participated in the first time five Th@@ urin@@ gi@@ an cities for the first time .
in addition to Bad Langen@@ sal@@ za this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ m@@ mer@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and B@@ lei@@ ch@@ ero@@ de .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the esteem of local trade and its significance for the common good of our cities are stronger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Stre@@ ich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action under the ci@@ ples of the I@@ HK and with many partners will also make clear that each citizen might influence its direct environment yourself .

dre@@ ump made by calling @-@ scripts by telephone call Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the border .
trans@@ cription by telephone calls between US @-@ President Donald Tr@@ ump and Le@@ aders from Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on 27 January Tr@@ ump in a telephone at with the Mexican presidency En@@ rique P@@ ena NI@@ E@@ TO was to be heard , publicly said that he would not pay for a planned border .
the US President sei@@ zed him because he had publicly proclaimed the wall publicly . report that he said to him , &quot; This might not tell you the press . &quot;
Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the USA and sw@@ aying , Mexico for the project .
trans@@ cription his first calls with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ Hi@@ ke were also published and covered a ten@@ se exchange .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Turn@@ Hi@@ ke , that a trade for the US refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ri@@ dic@@ ulous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ri@@ dic@@ ulous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that the continu@@ ance on trade , who ruled him as a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after having put a ban on the move of refugees to the USA . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump ended the call , after having said Mr Turn@@ bull , &quot; this is the most uncomfortable call for the whole day . &quot;
Moo@@ res Ford @-@ Mass@@ ac@@ re : activi@@ sts bring rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice again
a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mercury was driving through a group of vie@@ wers in rural Monro@@ e , Georgia , and r@@ ump@@ ed to the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore .
before the car that was able to reach the four black passengers and a white rider , the bridge could reach a group of white men with consci@@ ence to block his way .
the leader of the mo@@ bs - a man moderate aging in a needle @-@ strip - took a long train on its c@@ ig@@ ar and looking at the wind@@ shield .
inside sh@@ um@@ ed the in@@ m@@ ates in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; frac@@ tures the man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ l him out of the car ! &quot;
cr@@ acks the still@@ ness , as a young black man was tor@@ n away from the passenger .
fortunately this hor@@ ri@@ ble scene , which was played on July 22 , just a follow @-@ up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when a loop is throwing around the neck by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; , but almost all in the audience are very real si@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 , I return to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to meet the night , in the two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ oth@@ y Mal@@ com , and George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - by K@@ u K@@ lux Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one was indic@@ ted because of the murder .
&quot; it is truly in@@ concei@@ vable that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we know it in our communities , even though we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks , who helps in organizing the post office .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a dirt on a story but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bro@@ oks is a 71 @-@ year old former Congress of State of Georgia and a life for civil law .
it serves as a dramati@@ cal call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Monro@@ e community that has never been fixed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want criminal law , we want the ending , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we have to receive justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot reach healing and reconciliation until we get justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a Jur@@ is@@ cin@@ er puts a du@@ ck on the le@@ ash of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ n on 27 July 1946 .
according to F@@ BI files , which were obtained from the N@@ BC news , more than 50 men from Monro@@ e and the surrounding towns are dil@@ uted in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process .
but none have ever been charged .
although the susp@@ ects have been on free feet for decades to say they say that the dual motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions were known throughout the city : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice made the black citizens in Georgia for the first time , at the Adv@@ op@@ sy in the summer to leave their voice .
about at the same time as choosing the F@@ BI of black Far@@ mp@@ ters Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a struggle - supp@@ os@@ edly because of a woman .
Bro@@ oks said that the rum@@ ors in the city had been that H@@ ester was slept with Mal@@ com@@ s Ms. Dor@@ oth@@ y and that the baby that carried her , not by her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owners , 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , so the F@@ BI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ oth@@ y and their c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to the prison .
but when they removed from the prison and the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b spre@@ ads out the car .
&quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison that has prepared the Mor@@ de and arranged , then it closes a F@@ BI report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a distinction between the state and local prosec@@ ution which was not only involved in the murder , pro@@ claims pro@@ claims and the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bro@@ oks formulated it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; it was a voting right @-@ mass@@ ac@@ re , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you register and if you vote , then you will pass this here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for almost a decade Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual install@@ ment of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their representation is vivid , grasp and is explained in a kind of deep racism , many believe that he no longer exists in America .
it &apos;s hard to look , and even more difficult to look , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not want to talk about Lyn@@ ch because we will face all faced with its che@@ eses , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I cannot build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or want to hear what I have done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ sals for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a do@@ zen past@@ ure and the rest bl@@ acks - into a room and lou@@ der , as Gre@@ ene a well @-@ played overview of the piece started .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ enland Co @-@ director .
he has played the role of the boss c@@ lan@@ mit@@ gli@@ eds for years , but he said , the role will never become easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty , because I am not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to get this story alive , because we don &apos;t want to return to those times . &quot;
on the other side of the room had the actors D@@ ari@@ us Brad@@ sh@@ aw and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , their lines .
the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the ne@@ sts an@@ cr@@ ates and pressed it , angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ oth@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , n --- he , was w@@ win@@ ed of my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ cona inv@@ ents the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all the black actors ) in lau@@ ghter .
Gre@@ ene lau@@ gh at lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! &quot; , asked Ras@@ cona .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still per@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just don &apos;t believe that white people back then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; n --- &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but , &quot; wit@@ ting one of the other black performers .
&quot; you just have to meet the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
and that is exactly where the energy moves in space , a feeling of cam@@ er@@ ad@@ ness replaced the discomfort .
everyone is busy to get this properly , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four mo@@ red people .
the scene starts again .
this time , when Ras@@ cona the N @-@ word says , he says it sharp and with im@@ print .
absolutely no one laugh@@ s .
this re@@ petition ends violent and fast .
there is Schre@@ ie , shots and then silence .
a woman , with a fun@@ eral d@@ ressed , stands above the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and guides Bal@@ lie Holidays m@@ ingly lob@@ bies &quot; St@@ range Fruit &quot; from .
your voice breaks in every second word .
about one hundred meters behind it , a group of about four do@@ zen vie@@ wers swe@@ at and tears from the eyes .
the audience is divided almost as standard between black and white .
a couple is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , ang@@ ere@@ ist to see the performance , many come only the road down .
all of them have experienced almost eight hours of Georgia &apos;s ur@@ ged moisture when Bro@@ oks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to that point , the Mor@@ de have stayed a an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now if one stands in the same country , where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de took place , the air feels for@@ ged .
when the last scores of the song end sound , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and insp@@ ecting the mor@@ gue .
children ho@@ cken in their minds , register f@@ ake blood and the bre@@ ast@@ feeding body and whis@@ per@@ ing each other .
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; mur@@ ky a little boy , as if he wants to remember .
after a few minutes thanks Gre@@ ene the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors are throwing the Lyn@@ g@@ we@@ dge away and wi@@ pe their tears .
Brad@@ sh@@ aw um@@ ar@@ med Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the move , who has played the cl@@ an member .
Nick Ras@@ cona embr@@ aces two of his fellow @-@ players and then breaks in their arms , the emotional burden of the performance ultimately breaks up with him .
&quot; it is okay , &quot; whis@@ per@@ ing one of women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that this is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you have done this for a reason . &quot;
later the audience ends with the actors for dinner together .
at a table pl@@ au@@ dert a white pair from Atlanta is stim@@ ulated about the re @-@ position with a black pair which they just got to know .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski strug@@ gled to find words which feeling the performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to hear these terrible words and deeds ... of people who look like yourself and what they look like you &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what really does it happen to me makes me believe that Lyn@@ n is still heading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , that only becomes the police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

I draw a positive ré@@ sum@@ é .
max amount works as Vol@@ un@@ te@@ er
they work in their volunteer year right at several locations .
where everywhere ?
amount : usually in stone @-@ head@@ phones , once a week I help here in Gre@@ ven in the Fur@@ nit@@ ure bridge .
and I have worked on the school already in open year @-@ day .
what are your experiences with it ?
quantity : it is a nice , wide spectrum I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years , so are a late @-@ professional volunteer .
how does it come ?
quantity : I did ab@@ it@@ ur .
and then a construction engineer , we have to say successful .
I have realized for me that it is false , and I want to make something else , with people .
and then I asked , what do you think .
M@@ ach a social year , since there is an insight , as you can see how it is on site , in the focal point maybe also , really is .
and was it so ?
quantity : I collected great impressions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will start my studies in social beings during the winter semester . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will study dual , probably in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t H@@ erne a social worker training and study in Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences .
is it not something unusual during the volunteer services to have several different areas of application ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it always comes to where you make his FS@@ J .
it is possible to make it from aging to youth work - in all possible fac@@ ets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
I was also partly in the O@@ GS , thus in the after@@ no@@ ons .
for me it was exactly the right thing that has ger@@ ges me .
I could see and see my own strengths , as it is really del@@ ights .
other than in Civil Engineering ?
quantity : well clear , here it is not about to settle St@@ ati@@ ken .
one always has another man in the head , each of them have a quite different story behind them .
whether a refuge@@ e is whether a teen@@ ager , who has been fet@@ ched from the family - you always have to respond individually .
very interesting .
and you had no reservations ?
quantity : for this I am not the type .
there is a section that gives a lot .
much love , much kindness .

Pear@@ son cuts more 3,000 jobs and cuts the dividend to revi@@ ve the business
the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday , they become more 3,000 jobs and cut its intermediate dividend by 72 percent , as another restructuring program will start to overcome the pressure associated with which the company is faced .
the job creation , the Direc@@ tor@@ ate John Fall@@ on predomin@@ antly announced for the end of 2018 and at the beginning of 2019 , in addition to his previous restructuring , which already 4,000 positions are lost .
Pear@@ son announced in May in a third cost reduction program for additional 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the fast step towards digital learning .
the company that had expressed its participation in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House in the Partner of Bert@@ els@@ mann , said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged , after the first half @-@ year it has achieved a growth of 1 per cent to 7.5 billion pounds .
Kon@@ vo@@ i @-@ attack by Kab@@ ul : NATO @-@ soldier at self @-@ ord@@ attack
a self @-@ mor@@ dial l@@ ter has attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afgh@@ an capital Kab@@ ul , a soldiers of N@@ ato killed and several others hurt , said officials .
five soldiers and an interpre@@ ter had been in@@ ju@@ red , divided a statement by the N@@ ato .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ confirmed local reports were compared with the incident in the district of Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h as well as three civilians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bom@@ bing is the last violence that Afghanistan has hit this month - on Tuesday became more than 30 people killed in a mosque in Her@@ at .
on Monday there was a self @-@ murder , two people near the Ira@@ qi message in Kab@@ ul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an opinion of the N@@ ato , it is to be an explosion on Thursday Saturday , when a common pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Person of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; composed spr@@ ing@@ set . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement was argu@@ ed that all sur@@ vey@@ ard are in a stable state and treated in the US military hospital at the air@@ field of Bag@@ ram .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group , which is known as a so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby excav@@ ram .
according to the United Nations in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 there was at least 1.6@@ 62 civilian deaths , about 20 % in the capital .
late July killed a su@@ icide @-@ car @-@ car at least 30 people in a mainly schi@@ i@@ tic Distri@@ bu@@ ds of Kab@@ ul .
the Taliban said they had made this attack .
on May 31 , a tremendous bom@@ bing mission in the city centre more than 150 people with the deadly milit@@ ant attack of the country since the US @-@ led troops in 2001 led the Taliban ru@@ ded by the power .
the violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , since U.S. president Donald Tr@@ ump is weak@@ ened , the number of U.S. troops to support military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that in Kab@@ ul have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , its policy and especially in the reputation of President As@@ hr@@ af Gh@@ ani .
E@@ PA returns decision for delay the smo@@ g rule after law@@ suits
the US @-@ American environmental protection agency has a decision to delay a regulation of the Obama administration , which are obliged to counter the smo@@ g @-@ caus@@ ative emissions . this took place a day after 15 states the agency due to the ped@@ aling def@@ endant .
the E@@ PA announced late in Wednesday the decision to push the so called &quot; o@@ zone regulations 2015 &quot; and said , they show the obligation of the agency to work with states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and in mind that we react to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said E@@ PA Chef Scott Pru@@ itt in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in June , Pru@@ itt had announced the intention of the E@@ PA , which should be measured in which in a part of the country poll@@ ut@@ ant emissions are to be defined , where inc@@ isions are to adh@@ ere to stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year until October 2018 .
a group of 15 largely democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , filed on Tuesday Kl@@ age and said that the effort is illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried a wide range of environmental elements that the former President Barack Obama has imposed , as part of a wider agenda , which is supposed to boost economic growth according to Tr@@ ump .
however , the efforts have triggered the return of the democr@@ ats and nature groups that worry about the impact of greater emissions on public health .
the E@@ PA website says that the inhal@@ ation of air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; the pul@@ mon@@ ary function and can reinforce the breath@@ able sympt@@ om &quot; such as as@@ thma .
municipal council wants a common room
in the end the decision was clear : at two counter@@ tune the council of Flu@@ orn @-@ win@@ dy was setting up a joint space in the future senior residence .
in front of the discussion there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the still missing property is registered , Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
although it still will take , until now the parish of parish were in the common area , but there is now no planning to plan for the project from a private investor to st@@ em@@ ing project .
there is a discussion with respect to a community .
one of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered the community to meet .
on the ground floor it would provide a living area - approximately 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total of 70 square meters of space for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the community should fail to see such a common room as a meeting point only for the residents of the sen@@ iors of living , but open to the congregation .
as an example the word from the &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; made the lap .
the decision is made by the provision of funds for the current household already in autumn , through funding opportunities .
the building is located in the renovation area .
the establishment of a joint space would be , thus reported T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent fluid .
the qu@@ eu@@ tic rash may see to sign@@ alize the investor that one wants to throw him in this respect no b@@ ill@@ et between the legs - as well as p@@ ult@@ ing - which reduces the foot@@ ing levels and the construction of economic power - they would be possible .
need@@ less , so do not mean Wil@@ fried S@@ oh@@ mer , be this promise .
when it helps : un@@ anim@@ ously adop@@ ts the body .
it is not that easy to use the common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela &apos;s call refers to the many own buildings with which you are not doing so right now , but it is now in the common room from the window , says it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m hard to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ vonne Sta@@ iger is absolutely interested in common areas - but absolutely against a municipal stake .
it is behind a conce@@ aled payout of any case @-@ related or even foreign investors .
that is not so , because with the purchase of the surface you do not give a grant , but be@@ got a real , in the case of doubt , the bac@@ kl@@ ine is to speak .
Sta@@ ig@@ ers Application , the resolutions adopted accordingly , find three supporters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus it remains in two counter@@ vote in the original program , the Stefan H@@ aller has summar@@ izes it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we summar@@ ize the decision , we make a giant step to join in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

mig@@ rate to Star in the Har@@ z of Star
in the Har@@ z , the nation@@ wide first &quot; Stern@@ en@@ pf@@ ad &quot; is to arise .
this is planning the Club constell@@ ations Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
plan@@ etary path takes place in Göttingen , since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star lake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the needs of many Har@@ z@@ visit , it was called . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it uni@@ forms nature , science , movement and sports performance .
the members want to rise along the planned route and inform them about stars and star pictures .
in a first phase until 2018 , the association plans &quot; well accessible deploy@@ ments to five to six locations &quot; in the Ober@@ har@@ z .
In@@ question k@@ ä@@ men St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ tra@@ ei@@ ß and Si@@ eber .
the information on the boards are to be suppl@@ emented by the Internet .
that is why at the sit@@ ing selection , a good mobile network reception plays a role .
also Bar@@ rier@@ less is a criterion .
later the star@@ ch train is to be extended by train .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the star@@ base , the observer have much information about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , they learned why stars would have different colors or why a star more lumin@@ aire than a different , although he is much further away .
con@@ veys again , in which constell@@ ation become a selected star and when it is best to see .
the association has been running since 2014 at the Berg@@ städ@@ ter St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , which at the highest located observ@@ atory North Germany .
the location in the centre of the National Park Har@@ z is one of the Federal Agency for Nature Conservation to the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there to be seen from there the galax@@ y and even the Andro@@ med@@ a galax@@ y with a mere eye .
since 2003 , there has been a planet@@ arium initiative since 2003 on the initiative of the Förder@@ verein Planet@@ arium Göttingen a somewhat simil@@ arity such as the planned constell@@ ation - the Plan@@ etary weg .
beginning in front of Geb@@ h@@ ards Hotel in Goe@@ the@@ all@@ ee that forms the inner of our solar system , the plan@@ etary path leads up to the Hain@@ burg and the observ@@ atory - as well as a &quot; extr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( Municip@@ ality ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the stal@@ ks with the individual planets - including the Zwer@@ g@@ plan@@ ed de@@ gra@@ di@@ erten Plu@@ to at the end point - are precisely positioned at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the earth is shr@@ inking as to a sphere of 6.5 milli@@ meter diameter , while the exact 75 meters away from the sun have measures 70 cen@@ tim@@ eters .
the entire distance of the planet is just four kilometers .
while the light from sun to Plu@@ to takes about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans a good hour until st@@ ems with Plu@@ to .
pedestri@@ ans are therefore faster than the light in the cosmos .
the march to the next fixed , but would last a half year long .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko will meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia to stand in a colleague in the near future in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms in ESP@@ N @-@ offices in Los Angeles , to Gar@@ cia , the Un@@ gesch@@ lag@@ ene World Box@@ ing Council Lei@@ cht@@ weight Champion , the hall@@ way down@@ hill to greet Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Box@@ ing organisation Super @-@ spring @-@ weight Champion .
according to Gar@@ ci@@ as victory through un@@ anim@@ ous decision on the former four @-@ divisions @-@ World Champion Adri@@ en Br@@ oner on Saturday at show@@ time , both fighters are members of the top @-@ five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ List .
Gar@@ cia stretched the right hand and said , &quot; How does it go to you Champion ?
I wish you good luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko , def@@ ends his belt against Miguel , aga on Satur@@ days by 7 o &apos;clock on ESP@@ N .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as the couple dedicated to photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Klim@@ as , that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perfect size &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am a former fe@@ ver , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remin@@ ded Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I have risen for sa@@ ver &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; but I am not so great .
I am small for 140 .
I want to come down upon Lei@@ cht@@ weight .
and he must move to light weight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
they demand the fans .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
climate did asked if it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy , the Lom@@ ach@@ enko , with a 135 @-@ pound of debut in this year , to arrange in the next summer with Gar@@ cia a date ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) which also has an interest in the struggle against the winner of Jor@@ ge Lin@@ ares and Luke Campbell after their light@@ ning @-@ contest in the forum on September 23 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this battle could take place in pay @-@ by @-@ View mode , because all fans asked for him &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Gar@@ cia and oppressed themselves later to fight in the network , offering the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
none other names can generate this kind of attention .
when always they are ready ... &quot;
Gar@@ cia said he said Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous figh@@ ter , &quot; and he may possibly take part in his Saturday struggle .
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko stood at the rich@@ est praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he think the three @-@ battle champion from River@@ side are &quot; very slow , &quot; sorry Mi@@ key ... you &apos;re the co @-@ Aus . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said , the focus was , impact , then boxes .
both said they could feel the Mom@@ entum that turned up for their own battle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the battle that needs to be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other battle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am more than happy to work on it &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko said : &quot; I have wa@@ ited for the top figh@@ ter and this is Mi@@ key .
it will be a great battle . &quot;
four ver@@ ings after tire @-@ board
during an accident on the A7 , four persons were badly hurt in the afternoon .
after the first information , the driver of a Opel Z@@ af@@ ira is likely to take control of his vehicle at 16.@@ 30 in front of the junction @-@ wide control over his vehicle .
the passenger car turned right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he sm@@ ote them and then fell on the roof in the Grün@@ strip .
the four passengers - two adults and two children - were partly in@@ ju@@ red with the accident .
during the first supply of the last @-@ supply of the last , the A7 was locked in the direction of the north for about an hour , then the traffic could be transferred to the left lanes .
Fort@@ unas : &quot; Trinity is better &quot;
Andre Hoffmann ho@@ id after the 2 : 2 for the season @-@ opening against Braunschweig , that brings optimisation of the def@@ enses into Au@@ e &apos;s points .
the first start of the season was Andre Hoffmann , with the result also , would not be the two oppos@@ it@@ ore at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two oppos@@ it@@ ore to much , and we have to adapt even better into Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the def@@ enses of Fortuna Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains the Trinity is supposed to be further optimized .
and a gate after an open @-@ stop , the Fort@@ ress does not want to include any more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future it will be so that no longer places next to Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better to cope with the experiences in the preparation with the three @-@ chain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yet I don &apos;t know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says his coach of Fried@@ hel@@ m Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is his thing for sure , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we just have moved to the half @-@ positions in KA@@ AN Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko wat@@ el@@ mann players who can build well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pre@@ condition is , however , that we are even better harmon@@ ize and we do not make such a lot of waste . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , Hoffmann goes to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if one cannot speak after a draw from a mis@@ leading start , do not know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the performance could well be okay , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we can d@@ ast@@ ing on Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the tro@@ phy , we will certainly speak of a proper season opening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he wanted his coach nothing to know .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the start into the season is after six to eight game days &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Fried@@ hel@@ m Funk@@ el , who has not to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e , only because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be broken down because of an accident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season completely with a home game , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann , believe that the player from Au@@ e could perhaps be something fresh , as it could have no heavy and complete game like Fortuna against a k@@ ites into the bones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they do not know so 100 % where they are currently standing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the interior of the Fortuna . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the guests from the Rhin@@ eland was going to be easier to get a favorite on Sunday at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we have it away , just because we have the claim to come under the first six , is blocks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance sheet in only a defeat against Au@@ e from nine games is positive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga , which one must beat from &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explains Fort@@ unas of Ch@@ ef@@ coach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such a statement would be arro@@ gan@@ t and over@@ jo@@ yed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so Funk@@ el wants to experience his players on Sunday in no way .
new results of the Swedish asylum @-@ application tests published
the recent findings of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , which have been subj@@ ected to a new method for the medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of people tested are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish Authority for For@@ ens@@ ische Medizin ( Rät@@ t@@ sm@@ e@@ dic@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) has begun with the implementation of the tests last year .
they should do more exactly during the asylum procedure after the Swedish migration Authority ( migration short@@ cut ) because of errors in the assessment of the correct aging of some refugees , the under@@ age were born .
until today , Mig@@ rations records 6.@@ 8@@ 80 to test cases and the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from the period from mid March to 31 July 2017 .
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were assessed as 18 or older , whereas in further 25 cases the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency assessed that the person may be 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 432 cases , the conclusion was that the person is probably under 18 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tests will only be conducted in cases where the age of the person is ques@@ tioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency , the results are resistant in the past few months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see no major difference in statistics of past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the magazine The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high percentage of cases in which the person has been assessed as over 18 years , does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ ers has taken over his age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in May , the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases give the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suggest that the studied person is 18 years or older . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bl@@ a@@ det studied the 5@@ 81 published results , they set that in 243 these cases the person had said that she will be 18 years old .
the method of medical age assessment , performed at x @-@ ray @-@ recordings of kni@@ ves and MR@@ T recordings of kni@@ ves that are then analyzed for dentists and radic@@ ologists , was also cri@@ tici@@ zed in some areas .
a skep@@ tic is the end@@ ocr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ inska Institute , whose work encomp@@ asses the evaluation of biological maturity of people to see if they left sooner or later as usually through pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think that the type of measurement should be used .
the biological age to judge in this way is very insec@@ ure .
if we cannot say it , we should not do as if we could , &quot; he said the newspaper Metro .
Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk to properly judge a child as an adult .
the biggest risk lies in when the person is under 18 , in this case this is about 10 percent . &quot;
fully in the plan
the work on the three bridges of the Land@@ straße 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are well ahead .
on Wednesday , there was a seven tons of hard concrete involvement in the bridge at the eastern local entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; we are very good at the time , it runs super , &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , Bau@@ leiter near the department of street and Transport in the Intergovernmental Panel Freiburg .
in April the work began at all three sandy beaches between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the construction is planned for October and is sure that the timing is respected .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads over the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a v@@ aul@@ ted bridge from concrete , which is d@@ ressed with red bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 meters .
it was built in the year 1900 .
as the two other bridges also , it has now come into the years .
in order to ensure stability and traffic safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly re@@ constructed .
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built from red bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were established in the year 1939 and are twelve , and is 10,@@ 60 meters long .
the Bridge at the entrance entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach is now on the Mit@@ tw@@ och@@ tomorrow on the north side , a 1,30 meter wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called bridge fla@@ p .
this is a fr@@ ant@@ ment which is used as operating away .
on the southern part of the bridge the bridge is to be deploy@@ ed to at least 20 meters wide bridge cap .
then the pedestrian off should go away .
the special thing is that it is finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger Company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already equipped with the pat@@ ented bridge .
particular finger@@ sp@@ it@@ zen@@ otion has the shi@@ fted of lines through the building work in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a glass fiber cable that many firms are connected .
the inhabitants have been informed in advance of works by hand@@ craft about the project .
in addition , we had to remove fish and canc@@ ers at first .
for the bridges between the building of the building and the umbrella in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is regulated by a traffic light .
for construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bacher entrance , the road is locked in the area of the bridge at the height of the Hotel &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Si@@ eben Lin@@ den . &quot;
the costs for the three bridge are up to 700 000 Euros .
the whole is financed by the country .
Af@@ met@@ stein in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ unter Prot@@ est with German pot@@ ato al@@ at
it does not seem so often that parties pul@@ ling in a rope , but when it comes to an alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , what else is hard to bring to a hat .
the parties ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , left ) belong to a broad coalition that indicates that day peaceful flag because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle Ron@@ dell was referred to as the poster of the large elect@@ oral campaign .
and known names in the start brings - like Alice Wei@@ del , which together with Alexander Gau@@ land form the top of duo for the Bundestag on 24 September , and dep@@ uty Federal presi@@ dents of Be@@ atri@@ x of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are on site already hours before the start of the event , do not want to listen to the Af@@ met@@ a , but demonstrate .
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot;
originally the town picnic was planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; on the fountain ground , but now you will find on the parking lot below the Ron@@ d@@ ells - and with it right in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ met@@ ry event in the Stadthalle .
a colorful picture that has to offer .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , President of the Forum A world and one of the leading organiz@@ ers , really happy : &quot; great how many people came here together . &quot;
there are music and a lot of food , including a &quot; ur@@ German pot@@ ato al@@ ate which could even eat the Af@@ D without problem , &quot; says the woman who has brought him away .
the police has be@@ ating many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it is presented mainly at the station , which is only a few meters from the venues .
how is Af@@ met@@ us actually got on Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes of der Af@@ D volcan@@ o@@ fel reported which he tries to make such an event and received the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from the pat@@ r@@ st village had first asked in Dau@@ n , but there is a de@@ bug , because of the already built Laur@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ ams not enough parking available .
now , the Ron@@ an , Hom@@ pes is glad that we can have such a nice event here . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; overlooking the event on the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ platz &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the right right of the people , the main ache , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also does it : against 20 am on the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ vor@@ platz a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle various Red@@ ner , including the Rh@@ en@@ land @-@ pf@@ alz Af@@ D @-@ chairman Uwe Young .
in the hall there are about 200 list@@ en@@ ers that wait for the did@@ acy for the Bundest@@ ags , Alice Wei@@ del , and the dep@@ uty uty leader of Be@@ atri@@ x of Stor@@ ch .
unchanged , the police show , but so far the officials had a quiet evening .
a little over an hour will take the Af@@ met@@ ry event , the guests on the court have a longer breath , but also there is short after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police can with@@ stand - no special inci@@ dents .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some people gr@@ illed cheese and will eat him until the end of their lives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I want to try everything , &quot; so Kri@@ sten St@@ ew@@ art quite openly about her Bis@@ ex@@ ual .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I felt once in gr@@ illed cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what comes as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; next ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most well @-@ known relationship of the Holl@@ y@@ wood stars was the one to her &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; -@@ colleagues Robert Patt@@ inson , which eventually was bitter .
despite all the in@@ sured the brun@@ ette cast over to the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s B@@ az@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was seriously fallen in love I &apos;ve posted .
or believe it , I would have played it ? &quot;
after their separation there was Kri@@ sten to say that she was bis@@ ex@@ ual : &quot; I have always lived for du@@ alism and seriously believed .
so it has never been confused or hin@@ dered .
I just liked it , not being taken seriously . &quot;
especially it suffered in the words &quot; Bang Show@@ biz &quot; but in the school time , when they prefer as a Bu@@ b , &quot; not all girls are typical girls .
this really has been very in@@ ju@@ red .
when I had eleven told me the kids , I would look like a bu@@ b .
I really felt attacked , fri@@ gh@@ tened and ash@@ amed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; girls , be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially the public does not love to live her love : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people expect that you are in a certain way and anno@@ yed me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and perhaps I call me some to be und@@ able , but I don &apos;t like to justi@@ fy me before the entire public . &quot;
the govern@@ or of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
. the democratic govern@@ or of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thurs@@ days with a manifestation with President Tr@@ ump that he will change the party .
whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I will tell you with lots of prayers and a lot of re@@ think ... today I will tell you as the inhabitants of West Virginia , I can no longer help you when I am a democratic Gover@@ nor &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the r@@ ally broke out in Ju@@ ice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the re@@ public@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; added Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as a coach I would say that it is at the time to play a different game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump spoke before a HU@@ GE announcement at the West Virginia Rallye .
Mr. Tr@@ ump did West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice not endor@@ sed the democratic can@@ did@@ acy Hill@@ ary Clinton .

For@@ bes , that he possesses stu@@ ff@@ ins in five states , and inher@@ ited a carbon business from his father .
it is worth approximately 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee on Thurs@@ days gave an explanation in which it said : &quot; the Party change of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a democratic party that would like to work more effectively than working for our country . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with only 15 Gou@@ vern@@ ement and control of least legislative bodies in history is the last rejection of a party that is from top to bottom without leadership and unable to find a positive , cat@@ chy message , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the R@@ NC @-@ president R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in a statement by the C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; co@@ e pra@@ ises &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian sorry for d@@ oping sc@@ andal &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world leader of Ath@@ le@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , pra@@ ised on Thursday , which he described as an open @-@ point rating from Russia to a d@@ oping sc@@ andal , but he re@@ peti@@ te , unless the moment for the country to be recorded in sport .
Russia Ath@@ le@@ tics Chef D@@ mit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ ak@@ ine said during the IAAF Congress on the eve of the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships , that the exile of his country was correct from the sport and that he is determined to fight the d@@ oping .
he said , I am sorry for &quot; all those athletes , who were cut away from gold and silver medals . &quot;
despite his comments the IAAF @-@ Congress for the maintenance of the association , which was imposed in November 2015 , after a report of the world @-@ Anti @-@ d@@ oping agency ( W@@ ada ) has found evidence on state @-@ based d@@ oping in Russia .
&quot; I thought it was a very open response , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IAAF @-@ President Co@@ e the Rep@@ or@@ ter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire Council and the entire congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has experienced in themselves that they experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation will be re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e said , he is also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delighted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia accept the criteria for its re @-@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress has been achieved , but the Congress supports the recommendations of Task Force , that this is not the moment to use Russia , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the principle principle was always that we wanted to separate the Clean Ath@@ l@@ eten from the dep@@ ra@@ ved system , &quot; he added
nin@@ et@@ een Russian athletes are beginning with the ath@@ le@@ tics @-@ World Championships that begin on Friday in London according to the strict IAAF criteria as a neutral actors .
the leader of the IAAF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , stated on Monday that Russia still told some of the criteria for re @-@ setting .

doubts about the UN @-@ Mission in Mali showed minister of the Ley@@ en not : the bet was dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also of high importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country where we are only separated by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the fun@@ eral service the singers were brought from the cathedral .

Premier W@@ eil wants to swift re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP on the possible majority in Lower Saxony
Nieder@@ sach@@ sens Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) is after the loss of red @-@ green ruling majority for a swift re @-@ election of the country , but does not want to withdraw .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because it was on Friday for the resolution of the Parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously , the surprising withdrawal of a Green Members based in Nieder@@ s@@ achsen , the government of Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) was cr@@ ashed in a serious crisis .
five months before the official date of the vote @-@ election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover , they lost their scar@@ f a vote majority in the parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the previous Green @-@ MP El@@ ke T@@ est justi@@ fy its step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the election 2018 in their constitu@@ ency ( W@@ üm@@ me ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; stated on Friday at Hannover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
CD@@ U @-@ fac@@ tional Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ üm@@ me wants to recommend his fac@@ tion to ab@@ sorb it .
so both CD@@ U and F@@ DP have had 69 seats in half @-@ Sax@@ on land@@ tag , SPD and Green 68 seats .
to date , the relation was the other way round .
the new land@@ tag will be elected regular on 14 January of next year .
Th@@ ur@@ ers said , the red @-@ green national government , now decide whether they could continue in this situation without a majority .
Stephan W@@ eil is however holding indispensable for an indispensable part of the country as rapidly as its self @-@ resolution .
the CD@@ U group is expected to decide on Tuesday about how to proceed .
the local version also sees the possibility that the govern@@ ors with@@ draws the prime minister the trust and select a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our constitution offers several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these options must be tested legally clean , &quot; said Th@@ üm@@ me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will discuss all questions in peace if they are legally responsible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ur@@ fs n@@ apped T@@ west@@ ens step &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but a bit of course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the politicians themselves stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very good . &quot;
it indicated itself as a trailer of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens demanded the Ab@@ sin@@ ful de@@ pri@@ t for the return of their country house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we naturally assume that they received her land sm@@ iling , which they have received over the green country list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shared the Landes@@ Officer Met@@ a J@@ ans@@ sen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the presi@@ dents of the Green Ruth P@@ iel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ ent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they have deliber@@ ately decided to do not have an exc@@ use in the group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also against the background that there were no differences , we cannot follow this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD @-@ Chancellor Martin Schulz sentenced on the crossing of the Dutch @-@ Sax@@ on Green Members on the CD@@ U as a betra@@ y@@ al .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behavior of the former Green Members in Lower Saxony is not only condem@@ ned to the voters and voters , but also betra@@ y@@ al in red @-@ green &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote the B@@ und@@ esch@@ ef of the Socialists and Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SD@@ P ) to re@@ choose the land@@ tag quickly .
the discharge of T@@ west@@ ens costs red @-@ green in Nieder@@ s@@ achsen the majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the political place &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in its des@@ per@@ ate van@@ ity and in her m@@ ust her personal interests before the welfare of the country &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; cri@@ tici@@ zed SPD Secretary General Hu@@ ber@@ tus &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Nieder@@ s@@ achsen of this kind of in@@ tri@@ umph was and tries to hit its political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nieder@@ sach@@ sens CD@@ U @-@ Fra@@ il@@ sch@@ ef Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ üm@@ ler wants to recommend its members to include El@@ ke T@@ ets to the CD@@ U .
the leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , cast T@@ est , with personal career , as result of the result of the vote @-@ in @-@ election in 2013 .
the CD@@ U was then in front of the SPD powerful force , SPD and Green had in the country @-@ day , but a rise @-@ thin majority of one voice .
agriculture in the Interview - How do we protect ourselves from Gi@@ ft@@ ei@@ ern , Lord Schmidt ?
Germany is discussing about poll@@ uted eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect consumers .
Agro@@ ind@@ ini@@ ster Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is in an interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) of speech and answer .
Mr. Schmidt , how can consumers protect themselves from po@@ ison@@ ed eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumer women and consumers to accurately look at the eggs in your refrigerator and to check the st@@ amping pressure .
on the consumer portal www.@@ Lebensmittel@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states present the latest information on the affected eggs .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even , if after all we know pres@@ ently , a health haz@@ ard is practically excluded .
is now Al@@ di the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs m@@ out of the offer - because the central role of the clari@@ fier of the Bundes@@ land@@ sm@@ ini@@ ster isn &apos;t really perceived ?
the food surveillance is the task of the federal states .
nevertheless , my house has immediately out@@ dated , and since acqua@@ int@@ ance of Germany in close exchange with the authorities of the countries .
all information and the risk assessment are available for consumers .
trade has just the same as the manufacturers to ensure that the sold @-@ purchased products are safe and health unden@@ i@@ able .
if the protein level of 0.@@ 00@@ 5mg / kg is passed , they are not traffic @-@ capable .
un@@ loaded eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time is not the farms to blame .
are manufacturing companies and consumers in the same boat ?
upon current knowledge of the production companies do not meet immediate gu@@ ilt .
rather , it must be due to mut@@ ly illegal practices of services related to economic damage .
as always there is in the harvest time too little check@@ ers .
is it only lacking in the staff or on the co@@ ded jurisdiction ?
it was just the official controls that have un@@ covered the procedure .
however , the truth is also that food fraud and criminal energy can never be avoided up to 100 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially this is a consistent education of such events , and the survi@@ vor@@ s of the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in the cases where criminal off@@ ences can occur , of decisive importance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already made several times more significant that I am expecting to complete intelligence from the competent authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is regular Al@@ ar@@ mis@@ m at food sc@@ and@@ als really necessary ?
consumer rights and consumers have the right to secure secure and secure food .
if a not approved ins@@ ecti@@ ci@@ de in the food economy , consumer women and consumers are rightly ou@@ trag@@ eous .
by the pan@@ ed means , manufacturers , dealers and consumers have come into a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
basically , it must be clear : the un@@ law@@ ful use of the ins@@ ecti@@ ci@@ ds Fi@@ pron@@ il must not be unacceptable and must be ended without delay .
it must be consistent with all levels and work with high pressure .
I am expecting from all the competent authorities , that the Sak@@ hal@@ y will be clari@@ fied and un@@ inhi@@ bited .
how to impact the financial rules of Foot@@ ball to N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Rel@@ ay to Paris
the rules that aim to avoid tremendous issues of European foot@@ ball@@ ots , N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Wel@@ tre@@ k@@ ord @-@ Transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain does not distur@@ b .
any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Germain from U@@ EFA yet , as the leading organization that monitors the European game has the power , teams of access to the pres@@ tige champ@@ ions of the tournament .
financial fair @-@ play rules , which were launched in 2011 by U@@ EFA &apos;s life , mean that you must follow at some point that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without major losses .
Barcelona has paid € 222 million ( 262 million $ ) to release the Brazi@@ li@@ ans from its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a sal@@ ary that will be several tens of millions of dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Move to France .
PSG can make sure the money lo@@ cker to ensure that N@@ ey@@ mar notes and bring him into a galax@@ y of other stars , given the funding of the team by the energy of the mi@@ stress family of Qatar .
associations may arise for the purchase of players a lot of money , but must be objecti@@ fied with legi@@ timate sources , which allow them to make the break @-@ up point in their on the football @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the U@@ EFA Conference in 2007 .
the former French player believed that condem@@ nation in their quest for success had taken tremendous debt , effectively frau@@ dul@@ ent , when banks or owners with@@ drew their support .
in 2011 FF@@ P of concentration on the debts of the clubs on the monitoring of their losses .
the change meant that the business model , the novel Abr@@ amo@@ vi@@ ch originally used in Chelsea - a club with potential sold and then power@@ fully invested to build the team and build a global brand - to be a tough@@ er matter .
during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P reference period , which is going up to 2018 , clubs can accept losses in the amount of 30 million euro .
and although Plat@@ ini is fallen from the presidency in Un@@ gn@@ ade , his U@@ EFA @-@ successor meets Alek@@ s@@ ander C@@ efer@@ ie continues to cry out of excessive spending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certainly is FF@@ P not dead and we will reinforce the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible at U@@ EFA for FF@@ P , facing The Associ@@ ated Press last week . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the PSG paid the buy @-@ out @-@ clause by N@@ ey@@ mar in a l@@ ump sum , she can distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of its contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar signed a five @-@ year contract , making the mal@@ icious r@@ ams for the next five years in the amount of 4@@ 4 million euros in the annual financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has won the last together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions .
the PSG received a total penalty of 60 million euros ( then 82 million dollars ) , which was lower@@ ed to 20 million euros later - and it was arranged that the teams members won for the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 to 21 players instead of normal 25 players .
the U@@ EFA is looking for clubs which could try to list its financial confidence by connecting their income by companies , associated with the owners of a club .
while an Catalan company might be the PSG transfers , if the value of sponsor@@ ing the standard pitches should exceed , the U@@ EFA would not be considered legi@@ timate income .
exactly this happened in 2014 , when the U@@ EFA decided that the value of sponsor@@ ing of the PS@@ A was raised by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that a part of the PSG payments to N@@ ey@@ mar on payments of the organiz@@ ers Committee of the World Cup 2006 in Kat@@ ar could come .
but PSG and Kat@@ ar 2022 have argu@@ ed that N@@ ey@@ mar WM amb@@ assador will be able to find out about such a man@@ o@@ eu@@ ver for the U@@ EFA regulatory authorities .
the previous sanctions against PSG mean that the U@@ EFA will be yet attentive to take note of the rules .
the U@@ EFA had no prepar@@ atory talks with PSG via N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , s@@ car on Thursday the people familiar with the situation .
they spoke under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press as they were not fu@@ elled to discuss the PSG situation .
the last published reports show that PSG 04 / 16 with a turnover of 54@@ 2.4 million euros has achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros .
the accounts for the last financial year must still be published .
PSG expects N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrival a blessing for sponsor@@ ing @-@ De@@ als , mer@@ chan@@ dis@@ ing and Tri@@ k@@ ot@@ shor@@ ten .
the association considers that sales after signature by at least 30 percent .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players , and tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s de@@ duction in preventing it claimed that for the FF@@ P would hurt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear fall of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial d@@ oping &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President of the La League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish Daily AS concerning Qatar &apos;s final owners . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ar@@ sen@@ al Manager Arsen@@ e , whose organisation is owned by an American Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations from La Liga against a state who financed an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the owners and this has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible .
it is very difficult to respect the financial Fair@@ play because we have different paths or have different interests when a country has such a large player in order to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new tra@@ p supplier
in the past few years , ch@@ ocol@@ at Frey on board chocolate was produced for Swiss .
now , the committees come ahead of a possible end : the airline is writing the order again .
Swiss @-@ Spre@@ cher@@ in Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rot@@ t confirmed on request of the message agency S@@ DA a corresponding report of the newspaper &quot; Northern Switzerland &quot; from Friday .
according to current planning , the Airline will continue to include a new contract for the first half @-@ year 2018 .
the products were checked every two to three years and is subj@@ ected to quality control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the current supplier ch@@ ocol@@ at Frey we are very satisfied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spok@@ es@@ woman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
around 17 million small red pack@@ aged cover filters are distributed to 14 grams a year ahead of landing from landing to passengers .
at the cost , Swiss no information was intended to do .
industry professionals assess the order volume according to &quot; North @-@ speaking Switzerland &quot; at 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the mig@@ ros @-@ subsidiary , a annual turnover of approximately one billion Swiss francs .
but more important is al@@ em@@ al of the advertising effects : for a Sch@@ og@@ gi@@ manufacturer it is a pres@@ tige .
how many applic@@ ants are there for the new tender , Swiss does not want to betra@@ y Swiss .
but in question only Swiss manufacturers are coming .
according to the newspaper review , Ch@@ ocol@@ at Frey int@@ ends to strive for a renewal of the contract beyond the spring 2018 .
for the S@@ DA , the largest Swiss Chocolate manufacturer was not accessible for an opinion .
chocolate tables distributed Swiss since 2006 on board of their flights .
before Swiss concluded a contract with Mig@@ ros daughter , Bar@@ ry Call@@ eb@@ aut had supplied in collaboration with Hu@@ g the chocolate tablets .

blow against drugs @-@ Maf@@ ia in the country
police is a blow against the Italian Maf@@ ia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Mit@@ tw@@ och@@ tomorrow , in the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald @-@ B@@ aar , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Konstanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart were sear@@ ched numerous objects such as the prosec@@ ution of Con@@ stance on Friday afternoon .
in the age of 15 years 15 years and 77 have been arrested and ar@@ rest at the age of 77 .
also , the officials of the larger quantities of Mar@@ ih@@ ana and Kok@@ ain , Sch@@ uss@@ ungen , as well as several hundred and hundreds of hundreds of years .
at the time of time swe@@ eps in Italy two people were arrested .
against the two wo@@ unded Itali@@ ans there was German ar@@ rest warran@@ ties .
the two are therefore likely to be delivered to Germany .
the action was involved in the Italian and Bay@@ erische investig@@ ators .
overall , more than 300 polic@@ emen in use were used .
the members of the Maf@@ ia there will be organised crime , heavy violence , ad@@ diction murder , as well as rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mailing .
since summer 2016 , the prosec@@ ut@@ or of Con@@ stance against organised drug trading in the Southern German regions have been determined .
between the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Con@@ stance and Palermo , there was a real exchange and investig@@ ators of Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had almost daily contact with their colleagues on Sicily .
therefore , the big effort on Mit@@ tw@@ och@@ tomorrow was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo .
in the sight of the investigations , above all Italian national nation@@ als with close connection to the Italian Maf@@ ia .
also a incident took place on 27 May in Hü@@ fingen , where early in the morning there were several shots in a guest house , likely to go to the bank account of the gang .
fashion Perf@@ umer@@ ated large gaps in the fore@@ igner @-@ Register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens , which should not emerge , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : one report according to the foreigners @-@ Register in Germany sets significant defici@@ encies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the lead to partly gra@@ vi@@ ating mis@@ decisions in asylum procedures .
en@@ voy for the refuge@@ e management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen , has drawn attention to a media report according to large gaps in the Aus@@ län@@ der@@ zentr@@ al@@ regi@@ sters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defects in the recorded data recorded there could lead to asylum procedure and deport@@ ations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to partly gra@@ vi@@ ating mis@@ decisions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an analysis that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in an analysis that was published in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Register , the indications included ten million people with foreign nation@@ ality , including about 5,@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU states .
the data are managed according to approximately 600 pay@@ back authorities in Germany .
because the data has not been sufficiently well kept , the data quality in parts so far has not been good .
in certain cases , data from 1921 have been found , &quot; of people who have long been no longer alive , or of citizens who have become German citizens and actually should no longer emerge in the tab . &quot;
&quot; incorrect data inputs can considerably slow , &quot; it is stated to the report further .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in statistics on departure , people should be captured over EU citizens who would not have to travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but such false commitments resulted in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to a dist@@ orted debate on how to deal with the visa &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said it according to the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the federal government has apparently begun to return refuge@@ e families with under 16 @-@ year children back to Italy if they are submitted by there .
this goes forth out of an internal paper of the Federal Agency for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reported the &quot; New Osnab@@ rück@@ er Zeitung . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in paper , it is said to provide such procedures &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for families with children - with the exception of inf@@ ants and small children - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the end of 2014 it was virtually no longer possible , so the newspaper l@@ ending on the difficult situation on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin agreement , the EU is responsible for refugees to reach the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a mig@@ rant in another EU country can travel , this state may return to the entry visa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the reason to cause the office now : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile the recording capacity is considerably increased for families with min@@ der@@ een children in Italy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy has taken place for the recording and accommodation of families guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( EC@@ r@@ t@@ HR ) will keep these commitments for sufficient .
other EU states would need to withdraw refugees from the Dublin agreement .
the inner @-@ political spok@@ es@@ person in the Bundestag , Ul@@ la Jel@@ p@@ ke , cri@@ tici@@ zed this decision : &quot; families with children is threatened with children because of the short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian Asyl@@ um System .

the Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25 %
the Bank of England is expected to be announced later that the interest rates remain unchanged , after the weak economic growth and the atten@@ uation of inflation took the spec@@ ulation about a rise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England has war@@ ned that economic growth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will remain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they stopped interest rates on family members in the middle of an intensi@@ fying pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the policy makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank voted with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates on 0,25 % , whereby in this month less members have an increase in , as the weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for an increase .
in its quar@@ terly inflation forecast the Bank was reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and by 2018 to 1.6 percent and war@@ ned that inflation in fall will likely rise to almost 3 % .
but they reli@@ ed that in the next few years of Zin@@ nia , they would be necessary to breed the inflation of Bre@@ x@@ it and said they would have to increase the credit cost more than expected to get in the financial markets .
the members also coinci@@ ded to withdraw part of the Mam@@ mut Konjunk@@ tur@@ pak@@ ets , which was published one year after Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will demand time for the financial plan to provide more cheap financial resources for banks as expected , though , that now , that she is expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pound ster@@ ling .
minutes after deciding on interest rate the Bank : &quot; in the central progn@@ osis of the M@@ PC remains weak GDP at short notice , as the pressure on the real@@ ign@@ ing of households will continue to be charged for consumption . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the interest rates she reiter@@ ated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain imp@@ acting of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for cooling of inflation and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; greater &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; degree would be expected as markets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the markets proj@@ ecting the first rise in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Bank stressed that increases &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; grad@@ ual &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; progressive &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the growth forecasts of the Bank for this and next year are predic@@ ted in comparison to the 1.9 % and 1,7 % compared to the increased growth forecasts .
it has maintained its growth forecasts up to 1.8 % in the year 2018 .
the pound fell after these news compared to the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1,@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0,4 % to the vineyard .
the decision to no change comes after the recent dis@@ appoint@@ ing growth pay to increase the increasing expectations on a fuel caves and GDP has risen to 0.3 % in the previous three months in the previous three months .
growth is expected in the third quarter at 0.3 % , although it is easy to recover after the Bank towards the end of the year .
the recent infl@@ ation@@ ary report offered little enthusiasm for households , which will be affected by an increasing inflation and lower poll@@ ut@@ ations since the tigh@@ tening is first even worse before they get better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that monetary policy in the coming years cannot prevent in@@ coming from in@@ comes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they added that the wages to the end of their three @-@ year @-@ year &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clearly &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also strengthened even by the increasing demand for British goods which is attributed to the weak pound , which will compens@@ ate some of the lower consumption fees .
a year after lower@@ ing the interest rates on 0,25 % in the last August after the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the sin@@ king of the fun@@ eral .
the Bank estimates that it will probably be four years until this is fully reaching the prices and the economy .
prior to the final jud@@ gement of the bank at the interest rates the call was increased to a driving force , since inflation was boo@@ sted printing on hard gri@@ pping households , whereby three polic@@ y@@ makers in July have called a rise to 0.5 % .
inflation was dropped last month of 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % , although the bank said that this was expected and they will be back in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the bank said that the transfer in relation to its goal of 2 % is to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the weak pound rather . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director at Co@@ reco Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; given the short@@ coming back of the Sw@@ ap install@@ ments , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be more competitive , as the l@@ essor want to look after shops and end the year in a positive way .
the market particularly looks good for those looking out the existing ones and the new Mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with toll free options and low rates are becoming more popular . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; who announced on Thursday was announced by NH@@ S England leader Simon Stev@@ ens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; during the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) , this is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; decisive moment &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual health hospitals in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be among the first to permit the registration of people , and further clinics are going to follow in October before it will be introduced in the UK in April 2018 .
pre@@ ex@@ position phy@@ la@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a consequence of HIV preparations to be taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p reduces the HIV transfer of inf@@ ectious substances .
pre@@ p before intercourse is means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection .
such medication may be taken every day or as two hours before the intercourse .
those who come to question are g@@ ay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexual and persons with HIV @-@ positive partners who have not been treated successfully .
in clinics , suitable participants are identified according to the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not monitored by anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment .
people who live in England and are registered with a home@@ work , can also register for a possible participation in their local participating dental clinic .
the program will receive £ 10 million and NH@@ S England under@@ signed an agreement to deliver the drugs on this week after an international competitive procurement .
the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p , processed and implemented in a large scale , how it is implemented in a large scale .
Stev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should complement the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts towards the prevention of HIV supplement and over@@ hau@@ l .
it is another milestone in the more than three decades to cope with the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot;
Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive on NAT ( National Aids Trust ) said : &quot; this is a decisive moment in the fight against HIV .
pre@@ p when it is targeted at the ne@@ edy and endangered human beings , offers the opportunity to change the english HIV epide@@ mic .
from September to people with high HIV risk access to this NH@@ S co @-@ financed trial in England , in order to develop a new instrument which is really individually controlled and is not subject to a negoti@@ ating with a partner , which leads to the improvement of many , many lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we warmly welcome this notice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ian Green , CEO of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority must now be carried out , that the study will quickly be carried out in the whole country and that no one who has left a risk to HIV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now , as the pre@@ p test medicine has been adopted , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , shadow @-@ Health Minister , said : &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p process is welcome after month , del@@ ays and hes@@ it@@ ating implementation by the government welcome and over@@ due .
the evidence will show how trans@@ forming this drug as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of these li@@ fel@@ ong infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of pre@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is important that this study will be done as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people that are infected with HIV , and that they are contributing to an end to the spread of suffering from HIV in society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
life Living : mezzanine and cl@@ ever@@ e Designer @-@ Tricks have turned this little Ear@@ ls Court Apartment into a generous home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , reduced in 2014 by a large house at K@@ nigh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court Apartment .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed their bags and sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before that I lived with my ex at K@@ nigh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jo@@ anne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was looking for something that was comparable to my prize . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this apartment was shown in Ear@@ ls Court and had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have fallen in love with her and made an offer on that day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the first visit , the 1,000 square F@@ oot was completely rebuilt .
originally a one @-@ bedroom property with a spar@@ ed layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne storage space and a mezzanine to optim@@ ally use the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .
this was my request , &quot; she says .
to this end , she appointed Architecture and Design@@ studio Duck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to make the 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home , which was not just a development , but also a place to live for jo@@ anne .
the blank@@ et was not big enough to place two rooms over@@ each other , so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which you could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the steel system is fairly complicated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were over@@ stepp@@ ed off , without having to decor@@ ate ourselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not just about building a simple platform , but the steel so tail that he had the right height for the function above or at the bottom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement makes it possible to place the fan , two spaces at full height - with a lot of extra drama .
for the mezzanine looks a classic copper window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us via the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
Ges@@ pi@@ eg@@ ej@@ Gold@@ furniture , Silver &apos;s acc@@ ents and vintage Serge Mou@@ ille illumination put the style for the program .
the use of mir@@ rors plays a role when adding theatre , space and light .
in both ends a short cor@@ ridor is mir@@ ro@@ red to make him longer .
in the kitchen , the mirror like a window in another room feels .
at the entrance we have sco@@ red units place for all the bri@@ cks and j@@ ars of jo@@ anne .
due to the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space the beauty of the living room can shut the kitchen when it is not used .
mer@@ its kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a gar@@ dener .
&quot; a bit of engineering worked out , &quot; explains the fan of the steel @-@ reinforced , fri@@ e@@ ved M@@ DF door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is opposed to the fact that it is when you slide the door very easily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever usage of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne was able to win extra 16 m ² , an extra bedroom and a improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the plot - or how your property is valued , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ di@@ ment@@ ary form a real estate mak@@ ler will enter and carry out a calculation based on the ground @-@ size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they have managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time use high quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things you touch and can therefore help create an emotional connection in a home &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you do not de@@ ar@@ est you into the electrical so@@ ckets in the walls .
these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment itself is characterized by good design and increased square met@@ ering number by some standard in something very aston@@ ishing .
in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide to leave this not .
brothers struggle because of a 500 million US @-@ dollar property imperi@@ um
two brothers are four decades after her Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a dispute due to one of the greatest real estate imperi@@ o Victori@@ as in the value of more than 500 million dollars .
the former manager of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Foot@@ ball Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . this has brought him to the Supreme Court of Justice to clarify how their property and their business .
Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp con@@ frontation about separation takes place in the Supreme Court of Justice .
together with her mother Anna , brothers , 38 real estate has accumul@@ ated in excess of half billion dollars , since the family has sold a business in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood , sold .
there the family West@@ co je@@ ans and grew up to a chain of 160 retailers .
it was sold in 1999 to 85 million US dollars .
this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis has now offices located in the city centre , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler and shopping centers in the city .
according to an agreement with its dec@@ eas@@ ed father , Col@@ in - by Paul is described as &quot; Haupt@@ dar@@ ker and the dominant personality &quot; in the family De Lu@@ tis - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third .
a jurisdiction that it means that Col@@ in ownership in the value of 316 million dollars and Paul has in the value of 176 million dollars .
the division of real estate and cash has turned to Paul as a problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the distribu@@ tions proposed by col@@ on proposed him with the left , which I held for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote in 2015 in a first aff@@ id@@ av@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday after several failed , the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place .
the brothers now struggle to control over the existing business - of which Col@@ in , as Paul claims to be excluded .
Col@@ in argu@@ ed , this is not true , but thro@@ ws Paul before , some poss@@ essions manage to manage some poss@@ essions .
in an early Aff@@ id@@ av@@ it , which was filed in Col@@ in , he just said to include the dispute .
&quot; my Italian heritage writes , that the family is the most important priority , he wrote .
the costs rise in the case , with hundreds of pages with aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports from companies , including del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading law@@ yers , including All@@ an My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and from both sides of law@@ yers .
Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her des@@ her husband Luigi were Italian immigrants , who run milk and delic@@ acy operations from the late 1950 @-@ years and bought a business in Br@@ uns@@ wick .
they used the security to buy the coll@@ ing@@ wood property , in the Col@@ in the first Je@@ ans@@ ka family opened .
Col@@ in says that he began West@@ co , when he was in my last years of high school , when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 she hop@@ ed her own property to pass on to their sons .
&quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted to land the brothers before judgment , &quot; wrote them .
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis Group , whereby Col@@ in claims that Mark when leaving the company 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars to be paid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Paul &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in has kept very back , although he was a former AF@@ L pre @-@ board member and after a biography in 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire is the best friend of the television stars .
Fair@@ fax Media participated in contact with Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their attor@@ neys .
only Col@@ in answered by SMS to say &quot; I can really not say much , &quot; because the case is before the courts .
&quot; it is very , very sad , that my brother Paul has chosen to hide me and to draw our sur@@ name by the dishes , &quot; he wrote .
in the middle of 2016 Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother .
&quot; our Father would not have arous@@ ed that Paul and I would end up in our current dispute , &quot; he said and added that he still hope for a solution . &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our business will be solved in the near future of the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Col@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
m@@ umps of new govern@@ or is planning to restrict the media de@@ men@@ tia of the president .
others have tried and have failed .
perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
Poli@@ tico reported that the new department of the White House is planning to restrict the flow of flow to President Tr@@ ump - including reports of the news media - in hope to keep the boss on a more even@@ ly course .
here is a piece of Rep@@ or@@ ter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; as John F. Kelly , the new vice @-@ president of the White House , on his first working day with executive staff , he exhibited a main problem in President Donald Tr@@ umps @-@ white house , which he will repair : bad information given into the hands of the President .
Kelly told the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions . &quot;
K@@ EL@@ LY@@ s diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to ri@@ pp@@ le tr@@ ump by monitoring its media advis@@ es .
President Tr@@ umps relationship to television dates back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his television @-@ gland is still strong .
&quot; if Kan@@ did@@ at Tr@@ ump was anno@@ yed because of a fair reporting period , it was productive to show him that he was a fair reporting of places received , which were to convince , &quot; said the former election campaign Sam Nun@@ berg in February opposite the Poli@@ tico .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara pal@@ mer@@ i wrote to the time that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key to hold the m@@ umps on Twitter , according to six former election campaign , to ensure that his personal media sum contains a ste@@ al praise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ umps Twitter @-@ hab@@ it ever &quot; was &quot; under control &quot; is ri@@ dic@@ ulous .
perhaps these Kamp@@ agn@@ en@@ be@@ am@@ ten know something that we do not know others - that the m@@ umps are not included any more ig@@ ni@@ tion without their interventions .
we will probably never experience anything about the twe@@ ets that is not sent .
if his staff managed to maintain it several times , anger from it , then their efforts have been worthwhile .
but no one has consistently applied it that Tr@@ ump Con@@ tro@@ ver@@ sen calls .
part of the problem is that people in a White House who assembled out of competing parties , always try to present their own agenda by promoting its own material , which may create their views of the world .
Poli@@ tico - all busy with this story - reported in May about the anticip@@ ation of the consultants , the president of strategic reasons of question@@ able information .
this was an example which was described by Rep@@ or@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former tr@@ ump officials say that Tr@@ ump can react like a volcano on negative press sections , especially those with def@@ ective le@@ aks and that he got to figure out how they origin@@ ate .
exactly this occurred at the end of February , when someone was mal@@ icious a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet Prov@@ ok@@ at@@ eurs Charles C. Johnson , called the dep@@ uty secret@@ ary of K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; the source behind a bunch of le@@ aks to be in the White House .
although Johnson has been ban@@ ished because of sli@@ p@@ ans permanently from Twitter or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has expressed false predic@@ tions and re@@ voke her in the past .
Tr@@ ump read the article and started to ask staff about Wal@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ macher added that the dam@@ bar govern@@ or Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to manage a system to manage the Pap@@ i@@ erk@@ ram . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove to be an effective manager as a pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his cold self , and his advis@@ ors still strive to influence .
these unchanged factors make K@@ EL@@ LY@@ s Mission very difficult .
Master @-@ sear@@ ched - Post by Euro@@ pol
as the address is unknown , the mi@@ th@@ ilfe of the population will pray and hopes .
the police in all of Europe were ma@@ iled this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards to dangerous criminal on the run .
as the addresses of the requested sword @-@ cr@@ us@@ her does not seem to be known , references from the population are met and praying .
Euro@@ pol reported on Friday by the action , which follows the &quot; Most W@@ anted &apos;s Most W@@ anted calendar from winter .
the experiences have shown that many con@@ vol@@ ved of vacation rentals are hidden from Euro@@ pol .
I have put together 21 post@@ cards for selected criminal @-@ work from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 , the www@@ .e@@ re@@ ost@@ wanted to see more than 2.5 million times .
36 of the online @-@ sear@@ ched could be fixed , at least eleven of it due to instructions after the publication on the Internet page .
travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to &apos; milli@@ on@@ ary series &apos;
some of the we@@ al@@ thi@@ est home owners of the West Mid@@ lands are again tra@@ ded with some rainy travellers on war foot that negoti@@ ated one of the comm@@ une Gr@@ aben to back up a field before their man@@ nia .
the travellers have ge@@ ared its 20 caravan on a box outside a prosp@@ erous street of Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; milli@@ on@@ aires series . &quot;
they have brought horses , babies and an army of v@@ ages , after they were issued only in May , without being de@@ ported from one by the Council , to prevent their back@@ ups .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defence and op@@ ying their vehicles through a section , which remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; angry residents have than@@ ked the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said it is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; us@@ eless , dealing with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an anonymous residents said , &quot; They are moved on the assembly evening after they were sent back by Bentley He@@ ath where they dis@@ car@@ ded stones upon the pass@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council must indeed be forced to implement into action as it was us@@ eless when dealing with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the travellers were there in May , were moved and now back again .
more joined yesterday evening , probably today more . &quot;
she added : &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to deal with it by holding long instructions in order to protect its parks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I live at the Street@@ brook Road and I am not happy to continue to pay my pri@@ mo@@ dest@@ y if the Council can not even stop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a resident who did not want to be called said : &quot; it is ri@@ dic@@ ulous but we have just seen the last lap of this trav@@ eller , just to be pl@@ under@@ ed by another round .
the numbers have raised this time and you even have seen a horse in the park area . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a spok@@ es@@ person of the Council of Soli@@ hull said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the country beyond the Street@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps so that they can continue as quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to support our be@@ we@@ iss@@ ant , it is very important that as many incar@@ nat@@ es a anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police by calling on 101 call .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this contributes to a picture of the situation where the Court must prove when we present our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof becomes Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof is the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts is currently being renovated and will be re@@ opened on 1st March next year .
this is good news for the city .
because with the closing of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof , by the dam@@ aging ambi@@ ance Business gesellschaft mbH until 13 April 2014 , approximately 30 000 nights per year was lost and also revenues from the tourist tax .
in autumn 2014 , in view of dramatically rising numbers of refugees , which came in the district , the hotel building of the Land@@ rats@@ amt offered as a collective accommodation , which was adapted for contro@@ vers@@ y discussions .
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers through the placement of a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was then not contro@@ versi@@ al at that time in the community .
but especially Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts Ober@@ bourgeois , Julian Os@@ s@@ wald defended the hotel location and spoke at the time of serious interested in the house .
he should keep right .
the Group Lu@@ isen@@ das , with business leader Birgit Sch@@ erer with seat in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern , purchased the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof in a voluntary sur@@ ge in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of the three @-@ star @-@ Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter object four houses .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
you are welcome Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof stand for some time a long time of construction container before the entrance , and when one enters the house , it becomes clear , what extensive renovation works are done .
the so@@ ils have been pul@@ led out , ceilings partly mod@@ eled , old bath@@ tu@@ bs from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
there is still much to do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is actually a nice place , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
everything is to be renewed in the Black style .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ equipped show@@ ering , the entrance area is re@@ designed , there are new windows installed .
everything was later &quot; nice bür@@ g@@ ern@@ ah &quot; will be expressed as Thomas Sch@@ erer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the equipment .
if you do not want to position to the high level of the hotel in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on a up@@ scale city center , st@@ resses .
forest hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to be set up , explains Sch@@ erer .
both individual holiday , groups or business@@ men should feel at home in the hotel .
talks with OB Julian Os@@ s@@ wald and Tour@@ dire@@ ktor Michael Kr@@ ause he already managed , so Sch@@ erer .
the performances of the city are identical with those of the hotel @-@ group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
after the amount of investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer did not want to specify exactly .
just under a million euros , he expects .
even the outdoor plants are also brought to fore@@ man , this is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard there is a large terrace which is accessible from the restaurant , which is publicly available .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ aff@@ air : U.S. special agents sets Grand Jury
in the Russia @-@ aff@@ air around US @-@ President Donald Tr@@ ump , Special investig@@ ator Robert Mu@@ eller said a so @-@ called Grand Jury for a report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee has recorded the work last weeks , wrote the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under calling on the matter of confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the newspaper evalu@@ ates the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller have extended its investigations and intensi@@ fied .
the radio CN@@ N reported it already got the first inv@@ itations of the Gre@@ mi@@ ums in connection with a meeting between the m@@ illed son and a Russian Ombud@@ sp@@ erson .
U.S. sec@@ rec@@ ital acc@@ uses the Krem@@ lin for longer a long time to be mixed in the presidential campaign .
termin@@ ates are to be examined , whether they were talking in between the constitu@@ ent elect@@ oral support team and Moscow .
in the focus of the investigations , several men stand in the elect@@ oral campaign as consultants of the re@@ public@@ ans .
according to that , Mu@@ eller also took more and more tr@@ umps of private and business environment under the micro@@ scope .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the special investig@@ ator Tr@@ ump has personally ind@@ ented into the center and the acc@@ us@@ ation of whether the president may have disabled people in the wake of the aff@@ air . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys is to review and determine this evidence in possible break@@ down cases and to decide if indic@@ t@@ ment shall be charged .
Grand j@@ uri@@ sts are therefore also called acc@@ us@@ ations .
mostly it will be on when it is a larger and contro@@ vers@@ y cases .
the process is always behind closed doors .
the Panel also can be enabled by the prosec@@ ut@@ or to re@@ charge persons on the hearing .
according to the sender CN@@ N have already issued pre @-@ inv@@ itations to turn around the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump j@@ r and a Russian revolution .
individuals who were involved in the meeting , be challenged to a statement called it was in the report .
furthermore , they should provide documents .
beside Tr@@ ump j@@ r. also were Tr@@ umps consultants and daughters @-@ in @-@ law Jar@@ ed K@@ ush@@ ner as well as his dam@@ aging election campaign Paul Man@@ a@@ fort with conversation .
right expert said on Thursday Eve in the U.S. television , that the inser@@ tion show that Mu@@ eller should not be sh@@ y in his work and that he should be necessary to act quickly .
but it was not necessarily called the Grand Jury in the end to decide on the survey of an acc@@ us@@ ation .
nevertheless , the suspension of the Gre@@ mi@@ ums is at the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for President Tr@@ ump .
in the middle of the new revel@@ ations , the President on Thursday Thurs@@ days a speech in West Virginia to present Russia @-@ aff@@ air as a campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Russia &apos;s history is a total in@@ vention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the issue gives the democr@@ ats a way to feel well , because they have nothing else to talk about them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special consultant T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in an opinion , he know nothing about the form of a Grand jury .
this work , but also usually in secret , stressed .
the White House supports all actions that acceler@@ ated the work of the agent in &quot; fair &quot; way .
the former F@@ BI @-@ Chef James Com@@ ey gave three times said that not against the President .
you have no reason to suppose that things have changed in the Declaration .
but I was only used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fallen .
because of this r@@ er@@ wur@@ st were pre@@ mat@@ ured against dre@@ ump , he had to hin@@ der the judi@@ ciary .
Com@@ ey said in June before a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump took him for an attitude of the investigations against the former national security consultant Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n .
the president is under enormous pressure due to the examination .
after presentation of US media gathered the White House material against special agents and its employees .
the sol@@ dered spec@@ ulation about it , whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller was released .
unlike an independent Special investig@@ ators of Congress like about in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate aff@@ air around the later President Richard Ni@@ x@@ on , Mu@@ eller has led a position where he could theore@@ tically filed on Dr@@ inking of the President of the Treas@@ ury .
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to bow such a step .
two groups of re@@ publi@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators put out on Thursday legislative decre@@ es , after which special agents could no longer be released .

in total , there have been a series of un@@ common con@@ cre@@ eds in the region since about 30 years , writes the U.S. research centre for snow and ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a fact@@ sheet .
after the opinion of many researchers , that is possible to merge with the heating system .
the KO@@ LO@@ SS now has been a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Ro@@ ch .
Schel@@ klingen swi@@ ms on the sea and is fed by large gl@@ aci@@ ers .
it keeps growing constantly into the sea and breaks down regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ del@@ s is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarc@@ tic peninsula .
the north of this Schel@@ ci@@ de was the balance of w@@ axes and ab@@ om@@ iting a few years ago .
a complete re@@ duc@@ er was to fall there , writes A@@ WI @-@ resear@@ cher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
there is some evidence that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ m@@ n is in danger , as the fore I have never pul@@ led back as far as currently .
moreover , the ice @-@ plate is under voltage and can dis@@ integrate , if a key point is a piece .
the mel@@ ting of Schel@@ m@@ s and ic@@ eberg increases the sea level , as it goes on the water swimming and ice so much water ur@@ ges as it emerg@@ es after mel@@ ting itself .
however , the loss of the treasure is that the gl@@ aci@@ ers can flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before .
this could possibly increase the level , but only in the low degree , the British research project to the observation of the Antarc@@ tic ( Mi@@ das ) .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ rates is located after A@@ WI @-@ data with almost 50 000 square kilometers , with the most pop@@ ulated pipes of the Antarc@@ tica .
on the passage from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , on the edge to the free ocean around 200 meters .
there it breaks down regularly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it is a natural occurrence , and no direct connection to climate change is conscious , the ice is now in a dangerous position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British Sw@@ an@@ sea University . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the far @-@ reaching withdrawal from the beginning of the records &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he also confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; under scientists , whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ s will now be back again and may with@@ ered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said his colleague Adrian Luck@@ y@@ man and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our models say it will be less stable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this development will last decades .
even if this researchers re@@ mark the break@@ age of this gig@@ antic ice @-@ ber@@ gs not on climate change , so in the past decades , many ic@@ acy of the Antarc@@ tic peninsula are destroyed .
this long or@@ ap@@ ples of the Antarc@@ tic extends towards South America .
according to the research of the British Antarc@@ tic Sur@@ vey , the Ice area of the Antarc@@ tic peninsula has dropped to 28 000 square kilometers in the 19@@ 50s .
to decline has contributed to the decline .
the Antarc@@ tic peninsula has over 50 years around three degrees at around three degrees and tell us to the areas where the temperature at the fastest .
CD@@ U likes Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f at the personnel
because it always becomes increasingly difficult to occupy themselves , the CD@@ U ur@@ ges the CD@@ U , from the worker @-@ bound association to become more attractive .
only shortly before the summer break the cra@@ yon has passed 41 new jobs in the administration .
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the county of M@@ ett@@ mann .
now even 17 train@@ ees have their first working day after themselves .
the cur@@ ri@@ culum in the circle are obviously very popular .
some 620 applications were to be sold for those attending this year .
nevertheless , the circle is still missing to cope with the requirements and tasks .
currently , there are currently no inter@@ connected jobs in the circle of M@@ ett@@ mann .
among other things , doctors and Engine@@ ers as well as forces of general administration .
the CD@@ U wants to join the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG initiative and join the Fach@@ hoch@@ schule in the Administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the management should work out according to the wish of the parties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a concept for recruitment and personnel development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is to cover not only short @-@ term demand for professionals , but forward @-@ oriented to the application scar@@ city means it means .
the overall concept should be oriented towards the inside and outside , concrete measures for cross @-@ cat@@ ers and include a training on CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
this already sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with a personal problems , which did not know in earlier times .
other cities promote good officials and presented and offer more attractive terms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; speech is given by a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Competition of the Public Emp@@ loy@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this includes a high number of employees , the disease and age @-@ related claims resulting from the ministry .
so the highest time to action so that no more places remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter peoples , leader of the CD@@ U , continues with his party on the common application .
he did not have long ago on the cra@@ yon for a f@@ au@@ st@@ thick surprise when he asked the st@@ aff@@ ing of mu@@ st@@ ling openly in question and the rest of the other parties were aston@@ ished .
people would like to examine all the options that make a withdrawal from the municipal worker association .
&quot; if we do not come here at short notice about a satisfac@@ tory solution , the circul@@ ation@@ ary should strive for trade unions - perhaps also in collaboration with the county cities - a Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U is trying to get the CD@@ U , the employees and officials to pay better than the collective service for the public service actually fores@@ ees .
the sal@@ aries are currently exactly as prescribed , enh@@ ancements or more money there is only if you move into a higher degree that orient@@ ated itself in professional years .
yet , the tasks of the circle has grown more and more in recent years .
only a few weeks ago , new spaces had to be established , where employees are concerned about the provisions of the new pro@@ stitute protection law .
last but not least due to the increasing number of asylum seek@@ ers have land@@ mark Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ dire@@ ktor Martin Richter a problem : they have too little personnel .
Italy intensi@@ fied the sound to an NGO @-@ migrants
Italy has war@@ ned NGOs to use the bail@@ out boats for migrants in the Mediterranean in the Mediterranean , war@@ ned that they should not continue to keep up new rules for their operations .
&quot; if NGOs do not write any new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue , &quot; said interior ministers Marco Min@@ nit@@ i in an interview with the gymn@@ asium daily La STA@@ MP@@ A .
Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came one day after the Italian authorities had a boat of the German aid organisation &apos; youth bail@@ out &apos; , because their team had worked together effectively with human traff@@ ick@@ ers in a way that lighten@@ ed the illegal immigration .
the aid organisation , which has been in operation only since a year , ref@@ used to express themselves in a detailed manner of the Italian State of Amb@@ ro@@ gio Cart@@ osi@@ o .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us and remains the saving of human life our top priority . so we are sorry to operate at the moment in the search and rescue zone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organisation in an opinion on social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only assess any acc@@ us@@ ations which are currently being raised , only after we have collected all the information and can judge the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had the boat from &apos; youth rescue , I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , which has been monitored by I@@ u@@ v@@ enta since October .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is thought that his crew ac@@ infl@@ atable boat migrants on board who are delivered to them directly by human traff@@ ick@@ ers , and that the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers can be eliminated , so that the ships can be used again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one such coinci@@ dence , it was supposed to be 1,3 miles in front of the Liby@@ an coast , according to the acts of the State of State , whose content was released by Italian media .
the occupation will be susp@@ ected to deri@@ ve over the authority of the Italian coastal coastal , rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other moti@@ fs .
under the Code of Conduct , boats like the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta must above all have an Italian police officers on board who monitors their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations , have so far been declared to keep the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said the new rules as un@@ necessary , but unacceptable , as they would not have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; essential changes or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their bail@@ outs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
under those who ref@@ used to sign is the No@@ bel lau@@ re@@ ate organization doctors without borders ( MS@@ F ) .
Min@@ nit@@ i said by now that the number of migrants that came to Italy after the rescue operations in Italy during the last weeks to realize that efforts to strengthen the Liby@@ an territorial sea and cooperation with local citizens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the last days we started to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he gave plans for further conversations with Liby@@ an citizens in this month about economic development initiatives and with Ch@@ ad , N@@ iger and Mali about action to reduce the number of migrants that leave these countries in hope to achieve Europe .

there were three friendly guides available for this .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the castle and W@@ einf@@ est of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome bonus .
the first tour conducted during hot summer temperatures along the vineyard to the Michael@@ skap@@ elle above D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim .
it followed the view@@ points , partly in towers , from which one could look far beyond the paths of woods and the times @-@ sto@@ cked levels .

console instead of law@@ ns - Bundes@@ liga supports e @-@ Sport
are sitting at the Sport @-@ Stars in future before computer con@@ soles rather than fighting in the wind and weather over the stadium .
fact is : E @-@ Sport has long been a serious business , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - large stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gest@@ ures included .
these are also the first Bundes@@ lig@@ aver@@ an , who are increasingly being involved in this field .
the beginning made 2015 of the V@@ f@@ l Wolfs@@ burg , later followed the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the VF@@ B Stuttgart , which founded the mid July an e @-@ sports section and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to am@@ aze new young audi@@ ences for VF@@ B &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the Board of Jochen R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is safe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is still a considerable rise on this train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the upcoming weekend , the Foot@@ ball @-@ World Association had organized the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; in which the gam@@ ers of various clubs compete against each other .
besides Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , e.g. Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Eind@@ hoven , for example .
Robin D@@ ut@@ t sees great potential in the e @-@ sports .
the Ex @-@ coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Wer@@ der Bremen is meanwhile an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real football should deal particularly with the 14 to 30 years old , that young people also go into the stadium in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : the condem@@ ned to con@@ quer all possible markets , especially the Asian , to con@@ quer .
with prominent e @-@ sport@@ s@@ men under contract you could be present on these markets online , than once a year to send the Bundes@@ lig@@ am@@ ann@@ schaft to Asia only once a year .
what is it exactly ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the E @-@ Sport , computer games like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; League Of Leg@@ ends &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dot@@ A 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Counter@@ strike &quot; or just the football @-@ simulation FIFA on competitive level . &quot; &quot; &quot;
long ago , as in normal sport also have established , in which the pro@@ s compete against each other .
and with the Asian @-@ games , E @-@ Sport is already part of the official program .
but is it all about a kind of sport ?
for many , the performance is certainly ordinary .
even In@@ go F@@ rob@@ ous has long been faced with the question .
for the professor at the German Spor@@ tho@@ chschule in Cologne is E @-@ Sport a sport because it is com@@ peti@@ tive and lots of biological and physical reactions , which one can also find in classic sports - for example , elevated heart@@ beats , hor@@ m@@ onal changes .
furthermore , it co@@ gni@@ tive abilities , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a quick reaction capacity .
professional gam@@ ers should not only exercise on the console but also exercise their body and respect the diet .
&quot; the fit@@ te player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but also problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; d@@ oping is becoming more and more a theme . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in@@ spec@@ tions are hard to be performed at online @-@ games , and in the scene the structures of classical Sports .
positive points out the scientists provide the high inclusive effect of e @-@ sport .
players are international on the road , this is like a great global family , there are no intercultural inhi@@ bit@@ ors .
a study of corporate consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and Bundes@@ minist@@ eriums Inter@@ active recre@@ ational software ( BI@@ U ) tells the E @-@ Sport a rapid growth ahead .
in 2016 they have been implemented in Germany 50 million euros , mainly about advertising , sponsor@@ ing and big tournaments .
sales at 130 million are expected in three years .
against the barely 2.4 billion euros of the Bundes@@ liga are indeed little .
however , the E @-@ Sport &quot; is no longer far from the other established sports , like hand@@ ball , basketball or ice @-@ ho@@ ckey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte consultants .
international are many countries already .
great markets are Asia and the USA , where Ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez at the US team N@@ RG e@@ Sports .
Hollywood Ac@@ tor Ashton K@@ ut@@ cher investing in the e@@ Sport competition
also in Europe does a lot .
in an Norwegian school E @-@ Sport has been introduced as a class@@ room , says F@@ rob@@ ous .
in the Netherlands and France , the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Ver@@ a loud D@@ ut@@ t are now obliged to establish an e @-@ sports department .
&quot; in the European comparison , Germany lag@@ ging Germany &quot; explains VF@@ B @-@ Board R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann .
falling in no@@ stal@@ gia and the ancient times should be clari@@ fied , today is no longer sufficient .
it is about maintaining the tradition of the association , but the company is at the same time able to align the company on the modern market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we live in a digi@@ tised world , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says D@@ ut@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there you can not stick to it that just as football ever was , as it was always . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michelle Carter because of the lyrics , the Con@@ rad Roy for self @-@ su@@ icide , condem@@ ned
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encourages her boyfriend by texts and calls to su@@ icide .
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her condem@@ nation behind bars and five years were exposed to mal@@ nutrition .
Carter was sentenced in June for the jo@@ vial killing of Con@@ rad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 .
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is unknown .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter allowed to stay free up to date .
she had been faced with a maximum penalty of 20 years but her legal representative argu@@ ed that both she and Mr Roy in an psychological disease suffered .
in red sti@@ p@@ ants and a cream colored bl@@ ouse , Carter is with tears in the eyes , with folded hands and down in stra@@ ined eyes when it was condem@@ ned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your actions have brought Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ ut@@ or on the court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she ended his life to make their own better .
it has no responsibility for you , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has no rep@@ ent@@ ance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ker &apos;s lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hor@@ ri@@ ble circum@@ stance that it is totally un@@ fortunate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , judge and Mon@@ iz said however , did not find out that their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; age or ty@@ res or even their mental illness have significant influence on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a prosec@@ ut@@ or read a statement by Ro@@ ys mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there is &quot; no day at which I m@@ our@@ n &apos;t the loss of my beloved Son .
I want that he is proud of me and how I go with everything . I try to be with all of my pain , which we shall carry for eternity with us , for his sisters being there , &quot; said it in it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ ys Si@@ ster , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that they will be followed by the realization &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; that they will never be part of the wedding of their brother or be an a@@ unt for his children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no longer this only person has been together with which I &apos;ve been together for my birth every day , is a pain that I will always keep in mind for the rest of my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to put a legal precision , as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to commit a different icide , su@@ icide .
Carter was 17 years old when Roy in 2014 was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxid@@ ation in a vehicle .
the case attracted national attention on himself , after car@@ ts written noti@@ fications , that she had encouraged him to finish his life .
&quot; Hän@@ g you on , spr@@ ing@@ man of a building , I myself don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; she said in several messages that she was sent in two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the moments before his su@@ icide , she wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must do it , Con@@ rad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All you have to do is to turn off the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter draws attention by the death of Roy and ordered that they will benefit by any press by the case .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
among the few , the Carter defended , Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , which was sentenced in Italy because of the murder of her British ro@@ omm@@ ate in Italy before she was released two years ago .
Mrs Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published in the Los Angeles Times a comment : &quot; Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help , not j@@ ail . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ me : learning from the new Mini @-@ l@@ ah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua Kim@@ me was allowed to run at the Audi Cup as captain , is no coinci@@ dence .
the FC Bayern tr@@ aut the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner a big season - Extra @-@ motivation is not enough .
something was there different on his place in the cabin , that saw Joshua Kim@@ me immediately , even though the additional gar@@ ment was very small , very small .
but since far and wide on the second day of Audi C@@ ups , of course no Philipp l@@ ah@@ m and also no Manuel Neu@@ er went to see , he made himself fa@@ sten to the arm .
&quot; the trainer did not have announced , told the Con@@ fed Cup winner , after his first use as Bavaria captain .
good , the entrance could have been better run than at the 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the character of the co@@ aches could also interpre@@ t .
not the eight years earlier Art@@ uro Vi@@ dal was born in the youth of youth , Deb@@ üt@@ onds and especially from the holiday professionals , existing C @-@ El@@ f as game guides , but he .
sugar cane distri@@ butes well in the de@@ ar@@ est to those who want to do much in La@@ une .
wh@@ o@@ ever was au@@ ser@@ tation to join the heritage of l@@ ah@@ m can make a small extra motivation only well @-@ used .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kim@@ me confirmed , &quot; this is what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday fl@@ itz@@ ed the 22 @-@ year @-@ old as a mini @-@ l@@ ah@@ m across the field .
to the right back , that is now its position , the white binder at arm did its rest .
and at all worked Kim@@ me in this start , like the one who can take the ru@@ der also best into the hand .
he gave instructions , tried to ste@@ er the in@@ mir@@ ro@@ red tro@@ upe .
he had the view for the whole , while many others were occupied with themselves .
Vi@@ dal thus to re@@ sign his missing fitness ( un@@ folded ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches sent to the de@@ com@@ ings to the achievements of Asia @-@ journey ( folding also only partly ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le , l@@ est no negative at their first appearance at the Bayern @-@ Tri@@ k@@ ot .
and all of all fol@@ dable is very good .
Sü@@ le ran next to Kim@@ me , Ru@@ dy before the defence , both ag@@ lies sou@@ ver@@ n .
the well @-@ known Napoli @-@ storm was often difficult , moreover the sweet@@ ness tried to be successful in the game a few times .
his colleague Ru@@ dy was there that the result was &quot; not as we had the expect@@ edly . &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance at the debut of the debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; game storage , Temp@@ ow@@ ech@@ sel : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this style I was also fet@@ ched . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as unusual , this Bavaria is still for the new ones , in connection with the games .
Ru@@ dy for example was not one or two , but determines six or seven interviews .
Kim@@ me , according to some funny statements in the back of his new fellow @-@ players .
there he heard of the sweet@@ ness an interesting phrase : &quot; what is going on here I have already noticed .
with Bavaria you just have to win every game . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all this he does not need to teach the new one . &quot; &quot; &quot;

it is often un@@ reconc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as Evel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) still was the Ministry of Economic Affairs of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
this shows itself more than one year in which the new economic ini@@ ster Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chambers and businesses from the region are speaking on T V @-@ demand of a change in economic policy - and simultaneously the old minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;

again this year the Ministry of Plan is based on a plan @-@ method , until 2021 the building is set to stand .
a role in the plans of the country also plays the West@@ um@@ geh@@ ung Trier , which stands in the urgent need of the Federal Convention .

Frank N@@ atus is also expected a concept of the country as it wants to fix the skilled crafts in the region .

none of the companies described the enterprises as a recall .
European automobile manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions .
but the nit@@ rogen ox@@ ides , the diesel engines , are considered car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ s and can cause as@@ thma .
the cost of car manufacturers , systems for neutr@@ alization of the disp@@ oss@@ ing of diesel vehicles to install , take also what it makes difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel will also be indic@@ ted to pamp@@ er the powerful car @-@ companies and ign@@ oring the problem of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the errors of Volkswagen to regulate the use of so @-@ called isolation devices that were regulated to comply with the regulations if a car was tested , but in normal operation conditions .
in the United States several candidates were charged by Volkswagen , others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Zac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Itali@@ ans and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be put to trial in the United States .
in the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen to have a system installed to b@@ yp@@ ass the em@@ ission provisions in Europe and a request which focused on the United States .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the inclusion of Audi in the investigation could have Volkswagen hard strain : the luxury vehicle manufacturer carries out propor@@ tionally to the profit of Volkswagen in . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ en@@ asen and the lau@@ ghter against the suffering
Mor@@ di@@ llo was temporarily on one of the most popular Cart@@ oon @-@ Gallery , the l@@ oll@@ ections of his figures are his trademark .
also with 85 the Argent@@ inian association is still working and working on a film .
his message : lau@@ ghter , &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist he proposed among others as an artist for bl@@ iss through - which he frustr@@ ated .
&quot; the hap@@ pi@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost in my job , &quot; he said once .
after stops in Lima , New York and Paris at the end of the 1960 &apos;s breakthrough , following the release of his carto@@ ons in Paris Match , and then in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
again and again the artists of cities inspire .
large , overall Mor@@ di@@ llo figures tum@@ ours in drawings with the Schi@@ ef@@ en Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning he sits according to their own indications , even today on the drawing , works on a daily basis almost ten hours .
about calendar , puzzles , books for Gross and Klein , T @-@ shirts , Pl@@ ush @-@ animals and watches find his dro@@ p@@ ly figures still much spread worldwide .
for six years he also worked on a cartoon film and a TV series with its figures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the main person in the movie &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Crazy Island &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a gi@@ raffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los popular animal in its drawings - , which has a thousand feet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time his figures speak in the 3D movie , which should come to the movie screen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they are saying it is strange for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the script is not written by him .
therefore he uses more on the TV series , which is produced as its original drawings , which is produced .
Lav@@ ender is threatened with climate change
he has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened with climate change .
the lav@@ ender is due to the due to d@@ rought , the conditions and because of the disease @-@ transfer@@ able insects , which scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions , great head@@ aches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , Expert of the agricultural research institutes in Provence , said : &quot; the Lav@@ ender in Provence is effectively at risk because the plant has exposed to the effects of climate change in spring and in autumn much more .
this has effects on the life of lav@@ ender .
there is also a small or@@ k@@ ade , a micro @-@ bacter@@ ium pre@@ cip@@ ant , and in very dry weather there are very many of them . &quot;
and there is a lot in the game .
lav@@ ender oil is not only for vac@@ ation@@ ers , it is also very demanding for perf@@ ume and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having a great number of flowers , we have smaller , AC@@ COM@@ MO@@ KING and either missing or weak@@ ened .
so we have fewer parts with eth@@ eric oil . &quot;
among the solutions that are considered to be considered , a better water distribution and the slow@@ ing of the light from the ground , but also the cre@@ mation of plants with a protective mix of sound and water and the development of sorts , which are resistant to dry resistant .
the little town ge@@ isa in the th@@ ür@@ ity R@@ hö@@ n celeb@@ rates his 1200 @-@ year anniversary .

the murder of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat of Mexico
the staff of the week@@ days of Ri@@ odo@@ ce usually meet Wed@@ nes@@ days to review their plans for the reporting of recent chaos in the state Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , cor@@ rupt officials and ceas@@ eless drugs .
but on this day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
it has been informed to them that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ level journalists discuss what is safer to feel secure : you should take their children to the office , which were the target of an attack with gran@@ ulates , or leave them at home .
security professionals have written three words on a plate on the front of the room : ad@@ vers@@ al , neutr@@ ons .
you ask the Rep@@ or@@ ter to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary , perc@@ ep@@ tions and stomach @-@ feel .
there are drugs , politicians , business@@ men , journalists , who are susp@@ ected to stand on the case list of the government or the cart@@ els , a catalog of crimin@@ als that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no retirement break from violence , and throughout the country the cor@@ p@@ ses are p@@ aced . 5@@ 89 stand on his ministry in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are standing in attacks and threats among Federal Protection and until now there was at least seven dead in seven countries .
among the latter is their publisher and their inspiration of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , the co @-@ founder Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence associated with drugs .
his absence will be deeply perceived , although its presence is present everywhere is - a great photo of Val@@ dez , which shows his medium @-@ finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hang@@ ed on the faç@@ ade of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce @-@ building . two re@@ por@@ ters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Miriam Ram@@ i@@ rez , carry T @-@ shirts , which will be sm@@ iling face with glasses or its typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the Rep@@ or@@ ter are discussing about their shared issues , trau@@ ma , their night@@ mar@@ es , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although 2010 was established a special prosec@@ ut@@ or to work in order to process the cases of journalists , this according to the Committee for the Protection of journalists made only two criminal proceedings .
as with most thousands of murder , which are linked every year with drug and organised crime , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely placed in court .
in Fe@@ odo@@ ce , they still ins@@ ist to treat the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are unknown and although the terrain is still twi@@ sted .
without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting on the discussion of security is little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it is very sil@@ ly to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we do not know why we are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mis@@ str@@ ust we all &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of 15 May Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the provincial capital of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
he only managed to drive a couple of blocks far before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was lifted by two men . he was forced from his car and 12 times was shot down on him , probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; Zw@@ öl@@ fter River . &quot;
the Sag@@ itt@@ arius was driving in his car and damaged it near .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two grown children .
rum@@ ors tend to be free to fly in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
but on the topic Val@@ dez there is virtually nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ mans re@@ tention of last year and the delivery to the United States in January Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the most blo@@ o@@ dies@@ t slau@@ gh@@ tered fields of the country as ri@@ val@@ ised fac@@ tions struggle to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or several people can be shot on the road or that the cemetery is full of complicated , two @-@ story @-@ story for drug ob@@ serving that are larger than many houses for the living .
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; tranquility , &quot; if only a cart@@ el control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs @-@ trade routes in the United States has .
nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Boj@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , with the blame that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings have contributed to the murder .
first , in February the release of a interview with Dam@@ as@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the ri@@ val@@ ed cart@@ ell@@ ations in war with Gu@@ z@@ mans S@@ ons .
this publication may have den@@ oun@@ ced the sons , susp@@ ected gang@@ sters purchased every spec@@ imen of the issue as soon as it was delivered to tim@@ es@@ ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second fault was that Val@@ dez did not force that , after the conf@@ isc@@ ation of another newspaper , published the same story , the country had to leave his own safety .
Val@@ dez was a leg@@ end in Mexico and abroad , and his daughters is regarded as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists .
he had been living so long that his friends and colleagues still ann@@ ed that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced re@@ por@@ ter for North America when he joined forces with five colleagues in the formation of Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars shar@@ ehol@@ ding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without going to the smo@@ d@@ ote problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mess@@ or@@ qu@@ ez said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with time the newspaper deser@@ ved a reputation for bra@@ ve and honest reporting , and revenue and advertising .
re@@ por@@ ter loves to publish hard tre@@ ff@@ led tests without fear of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship , and the reader were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories , which no one else could be covered .
eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ odo@@ ce she received the pres@@ tige &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Prize &quot; for its coverage in Latin America .
in the same year Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the Protection of journalists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drugs , where they lead to them .
he gave voluntary to him that he had fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to continue living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the time of the CP@@ J Award . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; drug trading in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you need to take the task as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b .
I don &apos;t want to be ques@@ tioned : &quot; what did you do in the face of so many dead ... why did you not say what went before ? &quot;
the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team mis@@ ses Val@@ dez , the Spa@@ ß@@ vogel , who was able to cur@@ se the friend , who was generous with hu@@ gs and rat@@ ors , a teacher , who knew how to survive .
you trusted on his routine .
he would always carry his hor@@ r@@ t .
he would always go to El Guay@@ nab@@ o , the bar opposite from the office , and always sitting at the same table .
well ask them : was his love for routine be ?
his own death also forced them to question their own ass@@ ump@@ tions about how they can do their work best and stay alive .
&quot; you do not like it if you &apos;re dealing with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their fur@@ tive in@@ - and cross @-@ ways to move drugs .
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ i@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even at the best times , a high level of self @-@ confidence and self @-@ keeping .
tru@@ sting his own inst@@ in@@ ies .
if it sm@@ ells , keep it away .
the hass@@ le is , the editor of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real that &quot; od@@ ours is a sense that can be decei@@ ved ... and then the thing happened with Javier . &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are in Sin@@ alo@@ a no more - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , gu@@ err@@ ero and other states , in which a gi@@ fted mix of lu@@ cr@@ ative sm@@ ug@@ gling sm@@ ug@@ ly , weak institutions and cor@@ rupt @-@ minded government .
the landscape is constantly changing .
in the room where employees met by Ri@@ odo@@ ce to security training , were suddenly no mobile phones allowed . days previously known that Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , for monitoring of journalists and activi@@ sts in Mexico .
out there were two polic@@ emen protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .
they were asked by the provincial government , the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ story building in a four @-@ story area of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
half in the joke , some of the re@@ por@@ ters asked , whether this officer belong to the 50 per cent of the polic@@ emen that referred to the govern@@ or itself as not trust@@ worthy .
it is months ago since the re@@ por@@ ters have gone into the mountain landscape , where the drug ban@@ den de fac@@ to are under control .
for the issue of that week ri@@ ck@@ ce has broken on three main stories .
there was the ass@@ ass@@ ination of the brother of the former known box@@ ers Julio Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an ex@@ pos@@ é to the state of the state that focused on the hom@@ etown of the Govern@@ ors .
and there was a group that resulted in one of the most expensive restaurants in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an , one block from the office of the prosec@@ ut@@ or , an ab@@ duction .
there was no official word about who has been kid@@ n@@ apped or how it came to pass , so it was bew@@ are advised as it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite locally of drug makers and public authorities .
a re@@ por@@ ter from public records , that the restaurant was registered under the name of a policy that reign@@ ed the govern@@ or Institu@@ tional revolution Party ( Pr@@ i ) which ruled the whole century all political levels .
recently several Pr@@ i @-@ govern@@ ors were acc@@ used because of high @-@ cali@@ ber cases of corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the Rep@@ or@@ ter to write about prior inci@@ dents in this locality , including one in which a son of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; went down to a military attack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a few months before , the reader had seen the C@@ olumn of Val@@ dez as the best informed source about the ab@@ duction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier we had already known what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nickname &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El FLACO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of its slim body st@@ ature . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
the office of Val@@ dez has been dedicated to the storage room for signs and stickers that are dedicated to the murder of journalists who have become something they had ever expected : activi@@ sts on behalf of the press .
re@@ por@@ ter Miriam Ram@@ i@@ rez be@@ got a few signs and went on the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the prosec@@ ut@@ or .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body has been discovered and proj@@ ected officials , based on DNA testing that it is of its .
in all the country journalists have become more lou@@ der by drag@@ ging in organized protests , S@@ OS Press , &quot; on the roads and construction projects .
this day , the director of Bo@@ y@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judi@@ ciary in the case of Val@@ dez .
in a meeting with the Gover@@ nor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day following the murder of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez sei@@ zed the authorities , journalists and let them bring them , because they have said the truth .
she has since then asked that it is once again divided by the government because it is concerned that their rage in obj@@ ectivity has in@@ ju@@ red its obj@@ ectivity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico will be organised by organised crime , participate in government offices and a similar society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ journalist , &quot; wrote that re@@ por@@ ters will not only be killed by drugs , but also on command of politicians and security forces working with organised crime under a ceiling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the media group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ulo 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; produced more than half of the attacks on both journalists and officials last year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico you give because they want you keep the mouth spro@@ por@@ k , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the Mor@@ de have a de@@ terr@@ ent effect .
nobody for@@ gets the death of the blog in Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your body was found along with a not@@ ebook that was supposed to be signed by the Z@@ etas @-@ Kart@@ ell : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here I am due to my reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a computer @-@ keyboard and head@@ phones besides their sever@@ ed head .
some stores have chosen to close as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border of Ch@@ ihu@@ ah@@ ua , following the ass@@ ass@@ ination of the correspon@@ dents Mi@@ ro@@ slava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue to do as there El Man@@ ana of Nuevo continues according to the ass@@ ass@@ ination of their director in 2004 .
in 2010 the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ arez at the front line with a editorial page on the title page &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have been escap@@ ed from their home countries or even from the country .
it is a pain@@ ful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile and they still observe the streets and look for dangers .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted as it apparently was mur@@ dered by the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was killed together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who remain back and continue working , there is a daily dance with risk @-@ rich decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra who once wanted to be po@@ et , gives us that the drug trafficking will be start@@ led .
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and this is why I was re@@ por@@ ter , &quot; he said .
at midnight on last Friday , when the last issue was already finished sa@@ ver the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce on the side@@ walk before the office and d@@ rank beer , than at one time all their phones began .
a number of sho@@ ot@@ ings with belt gri@@ ds and safety ju@@ ices close to the bathing house Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed T@@ ads .
the war continues to escal@@ ate as it was promised by a series of Kart@@ ell &apos;s messages in the region .
from the edge of the border , they have published the news on the site of Ri@@ odo@@ ce via mobile phone .
the front page will be subject to change the next day .
Sir@@ enas are close to - another shooting in the area .
Boj@@ or@@ qu@@ ez gave a look at the polic@@ emen , the betting held to see if they were in read@@ iness .
if they had fear of all , they showed it not .
under the vast portrait of the folded Grün@@ er of the newspaper , whose central finger was visible for quite Sin@@ alo@@ a , followed the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce its foot@@ steps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you also keep thinking about &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Bo@@ ik@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the same day was ass@@ ass@@ inated to the Javier , she asked me to send her to the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ os@@ aur@@ s used cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age to avoid his enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , even though a terri@@ fying thing .
now researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible Nas@@ horn of a Canadian mountain work@@ ers were so well preserved that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of Din@@ os@@ aur@@ s . &quot;
it was so well preserved that they could even notice that his created skin was killed by red@@ dish Braun - and they said they had something of a &quot; un@@ quiet past . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Current Bi@@ ology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proved to be found &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the st@@ oned arm@@ os@@ aur@@ s , who ever was found , and one of the best din@@ os@@ aur@@ s specimens of the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fos@@ sil is a newly discovered kind of N@@ od@@ os@@ aur@@ s , who lived in the middle of down@@ time period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
its incredibly well er@@ ately condition has resear@@ cher which it as &quot; really remarkable &quot; describe , aston@@ ished
according to reports at National Geo@@ graphic , the ge@@ sted plant @-@ fres@@ ser is the best preserved Fos@@ sil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k , when he was on 21 March 2011 in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , gru@@ b .
he met something that appeared in the surrounding rocks at the Plat@@ ze , and decided to look in more detail .
the fos@@ sil came from him fos@@ sil was sent into the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to cover the wild animals within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) of heavy ra@@ inf@@ ant .
after all this hard work the finished result is now ready to un@@ veil@@ ed .
&quot; if you just blin@@ zeln a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that it slept , &quot; said the Haupt@@ aut@@ or Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum where the cre@@ ature is to be seen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will enter the scientific history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ os@@ aur@@ s - the mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ os@@ aur@@ io . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
researchers have found that this plant fres@@ ser , though it is covered with a arm@@ or and a changing tanks , probably was threatened by meat @-@ eating din@@ os@@ aur@@ s .
the strongly coated din@@ os@@ aur@@ s used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age to hide themselves from pre@@ dat@@ ast@@ ing , and used a sh@@ iel@@ ding technology which is used as a bac@@ kl@@ ine , which is also used by many modern animals .
this could have been allowed to per@@ ish themselves better into its surroundings and to hide its enemies , say , which suggests that it was threatened by greater din@@ os@@ aur@@ s .
the 110 million year old cre@@ ature from the family of the N@@ od@@ os@@ aur@@ s has made head@@ lines in May and is now listed in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and it Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta marked with the Muse@@ um@@ st@@ echni@@ ker Mark Mitch@@ ell , one of a team who has spent more than 7,@@ 000 hours with it carefully .
the amazing conservation of the tree allowed it to document Dr. Mitch@@ ell and an international team of scientists , the pattern and the form of sc@@ ales and arm@@ or about his body .
they discovered the conspir@@ acies , a widespread defense method in the animal @-@ rich , which means that the top of the cre@@ ature dar@@ ker was dar@@ ker than their under@@ side .
although the contem@@ pl@@ ation is custom@@ ary , the results are surprising , as the size of Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta by far the animals living today .
it indicates that the din@@ os@@ aur@@ s had enough pressure due to meat @-@ eating din@@ os@@ aur@@ s , that evolution has been fav@@ oured as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals that ap@@ point the conspir@@ acies - think of ra@@ e , z@@ eb@@ ras or gir@@ d@@ ams - are much smaller and viol@@ ated than lo@@ ot , which sign@@ alized that this N@@ od@@ os@@ aur@@ s was exposed to a real struggle for survival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ ory behaviour on a massive , strong ar@@ mo@@ red din@@ os@@ aur@@ s show how dangerous the din@@ os@@ aur@@ s have been to be dangerous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chemical analysis organ@@ ically connections in their sc@@ ales also indicates that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r brown was .
scientists continue to investigate the animal and references about his life , including his consolidated Dar@@ at , to find out what it has eaten as his final meal .
they believe that the din@@ os@@ aur@@ s , when he died , was driven into a river and also driven into the sea where he s@@ ank on the back to the sea .
at that time Alber@@ ta was as warm as South flu@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably far more widespread than they are today .
&quot; this N@@ od@@ os@@ aur@@ s is really remarkable , because it is fully covered with preser@@ v@@ ated skin , but also in three dimensions and the original form of the animal re@@ tains , &quot; said Brown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that the animal looks almost as much as in the early wars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you do not need to use much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you are just a little with the eyes sh@@ iel@@ en , you could almost believe that he is in sleeping . &quot;
the ch@@ alk time was a time , as a huge thermal bath , fl@@ at@@ ous din@@ os@@ aur@@ s , which stood on two legs , the earth was crossed .
although the king of them , the Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ os@@ aur@@ um Rex , million years after Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta lived , the p@@ inn@@ ed din@@ os@@ aur@@ s was ad@@ jour@@ ned by some of his terrible ancestors .
this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ r , a 38 feet ( 11.@@ 5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters .
the scientists , whose latest findings in the journal Current Bi@@ ology appear , believe that Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta decreased after death in the sea and in the mud .
the cre@@ ature was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k , when he was on 21 March 2011 in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , gru@@ b .
according to the museum , it is the abandoned din@@ os@@ aur@@ s of the world , including skin and arm@@ aments , and is complete from the mu@@ zzle to the hip .
the creatures were average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and have weigh@@ ed up to 3.000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it enth@@ s two 20 @-@ inch types tops , which rag@@ ged from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ge@@ sted plant re@@ fres@@ ser was curved through Western Canada until a floo@@ ded river was floo@@ ded into the open sea .
but the habitat of the din@@ os@@ aur@@ riers passed its arm@@ or in exquisite details .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied rem@@ n@@ ant of this specific spec@@ imen are so well preserved that the door@@ step is still b@@ ump@@ y ar@@ mo@@ red panels covering up the din@@ os@@ aur@@ s
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko for National Geo@@ graphic , such a level of conservation is as rare as a profit in the lot@@ to .
the more I wo@@ e , the more it will be .
pet@@ ri@@ fied Rest@@ e of the skin still cover the hol@@ y ar@@ mo@@ red panels , which carry the skull of the beast .
his right fore@@ foot is on his side , his five fingers are split up .
I can count the shed on its sole .
in the Thunder@@ storm : Mass@@ enk@@ ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A8 : many Ver@@ sions
violent accident on Thursday Saturday on Thurs@@ days : just under 30 cars are involved in a mass @-@ friendly bol@@ age .
there are numerous associations , long kilomet@@ re tri@@ m - and g@@ aff@@ er .
on the highway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A8 ) have been in@@ ju@@ red on the late Thursday afternoon at a mass strike around 20 people .
according to the first information the police were against 17.00 hours between the connections Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a th@@ under@@ stor@@ ms almost 30 cars , including probably trucks .
on the exact number of the last gaps there are no data available .
it was light to medium @-@ sized injury , said a polic@@ eman .
a large listing of rescue vehicles was at the in@@ genu@@ ity .
the Autobahn was locked in direction of Munich completely .
in the direction of Munich , a approximately ten kilometres long back .
like an AZ @-@ re@@ por@@ ter , it also came to a counter @-@ car to massive disabilities - due to numerous genes .
fire bri@@ g@@ ade noted the characteristic of the vehicles that now have to reck@@ on with sensitive pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 Uhr then a second accident on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a coll@@ ision between an auto@@ vent and a car .
a rescue hel@@ ic@@ opter was on the road to the accident .
Deutsche Bahn : group test@@ es &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced before : nothing is dead on the train and as@@ le@@ ep .
or it is deep@@ ened in his work and has just a geni@@ ous thought .
and then : pu@@ ff@@ f .
comes the Schaff@@ ner und w@@ ok@@ en an uns@@ an@@ ft or h@@ ates the rides in the middle of the workflow .
ticket control .
but times of inter@@ rup@@ tions are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently under @-@ control card control .
you just confirm by mobile phone that you have taken his place and can be upgraded to the ticket card .
currently , a test run runs on two routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes the offer , we expand it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is expected to be available in Germany next year on many other remote trains in Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said a train speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is called the trains the driver stand@@ ings without Schaff@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be able to use that , however , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to book an online ticket - what already most passengers do .
you also have to have purchased it over the app from the railway , the DB Navigator , which is why the most convenient way of ticket booking is .
and finally you need a seat @-@ reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works in the train , it runs in the train , calls his ticket under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in case of the test customers then there will be a button for electronic de@@ valuation .
the traction companion get a message on their mobile devices that Fahr@@ g@@ ast X is located in the train and has taken the broken seat .
comes the train companion in the ticket control to place Y white he that there is a passenger with already de@@ pri@@ et@@ em online ticket .
so you can continue to work , continue to be silent .
the &quot; check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the rail@@ ways - which is to use the passenger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wants to travel without ticket control by our train @-@ companion , ch@@ illed in the DB Navigator just yourself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this enables the passengers to shape their travel time in the train , &quot; says Michael Peters@@ on , Marketing manager of DB Explorer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; second Plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to address the individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
wh@@ o@@ ever de@@ parts that drives you know that besides del@@ ays and missed the rides are to the largest nu@@ ances .
because often , in any case one of the fellow travelers do not need any documents that you need to de@@ valuation of online tickets .
either the credit card or the human card is missing or otherwise a document which one must advance .
the result are endless discussions between traction guides and rides , which leads to poor mood in the part or large space and del@@ ays in controlling your own tickets and taking the activity at the end the time takes care of other concerns .
there is only a small number of test@@ ers to use the new service .
and that also applies to the ICE ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further rail numbers on the same track are not yet un@@ locked .
how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Britt@@ any Fer@@ rell was sh@@ aken up to their core .
just a day after she arrived in New York City having arrived in St. Louis born on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b flat , which they rented and sc@@ roll@@ out by Facebook on their phone .
she st@@ um@@ bled over a mail of someone from the High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year child and it is still on the street , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
bew@@ il@@ dered , because no one else had posted the information on their feed , she joined Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly saved on their tim@@ eline .
the Rap@@ per from the territory of St. Louis was thereby the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , killed , live live .
he post@@ ete a picture of Brow@@ ns &apos;s lively body that was spread over the street and there were four hours left .
&quot; this is wild , &quot; thought Fer@@ rell .
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she depos@@ ited her cell phone to return later in the evening to twe@@ ets about people at the Can@@ field @-@ Drive .
there were photos of the police band and people , scre@@ amed , and from a man who claimed to be a burning with the wording : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
they wat@@ ched a live feed , with which a polic@@ eman in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators standing with a rebel@@ li@@ ous dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , dep@@ t a different polic@@ eman his gun and cri@@ ed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is not usual , &quot; remin@@ ded Fer@@ rell to her statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder that we used to have acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to and which we can call . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at this moment I felt sh@@ ook .
I was angry and we@@ pt . &quot;
you booked a flight back and went home the next day .
after landing at 23 o &apos;clock she received her 6 year old daughter from the house of her father , and decided that the two went to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on next morning .
what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary , &quot; Wh@@ ose thir@@ ets ? &quot; in the cin@@ emas from the 11th century .
it is a history of survival and the protest , of love and loss , of strength and resistance , which exists in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers .
as a li@@ king with her daughter who had a flower gar@@ ment and a suitable crown , according to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two had a conversation that they had countless times before this morning , over the black experience and the black condition . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I have taught you when black people must fight for it , what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remin@@ ded it of what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police have killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that was not right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I could not take her , &quot; said Fer@@ rell later .
&quot; that which happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
it must know it and it must be seen and raised in it .
it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the different layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to free to free ourselves .
even though I have the happiness to give her an experience in which she personally is experiencing a cle@@ ave of racism , she is no different than the next black women child .
I feel I would have a bad service to keep them away from it . &quot;
the first station when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority that was placed to a camper , considered the activi@@ sts on the possible non @-@ indic@@ t@@ ment of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there Fer@@ rell and her daughter joined together with a local business lover who did lunch .
they prepared po@@ ckets before and hal@@ ted to pass on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly started a new kind of activ@@ ism for Fer@@ rell .
&quot; my activ@@ ism changed completely after August 9 , &quot; said it and notices that she was appointed as Stu@@ dentin at the University of Miss@@ ouri @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had no experience in organizing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has all come . &quot;
weeks later Fer@@ rell met during an evening demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ director of the film .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said , she and her Kamer@@ am@@ ann Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ r@@ ar wished only to document , what happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a question came in Fer@@ rell : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you document or try to find a story that you can use ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this skep@@ tic@@ ism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often of wh@@ ites - in a community that benef@@ ited from her pain and her resi@@ li@@ ence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently explained in an interview : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that people who were born in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on and raised their voices , and we wanted to do it differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the then Co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the field that is known for his activ@@ ism in around To@@ dest@@ ra@@ kt &apos;s in@@ m@@ ates .
his involvement has brought the project closer together with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years following browsers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us . we talk &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Davis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the main guard for me as these people are represented , as I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to focus on a Fer@@ rel@@ ls experience - to show that it is not about a Messi@@ ah guide , but a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it proved to be the revealed participant in the film .
consequently , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Fer@@ rell &apos;s life as she likes to love and mar@@ ries her wife .
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that it has to give a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the feeding of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Fer@@ rel@@ ls is the role of black we@@ eping women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; two of the three founders of the movement which after the killing of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ by Martin in 2012 have shaped the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black@@ li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , sul@@ g@@ low women in executive positions have carried the movement altogether , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and therefore we are fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
black , sul@@ g@@ low women must carry the main load of everything . &quot;
follow @-@ on to notice that &quot; the movement is really held by black women and many black women . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is important that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a affir@@ mati@@ ver type of action , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where Fer@@ rell was selected as a heart of film due to her identity as a heart of film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was the person who sh@@ ook this energy &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s no coinci@@ dence , even though it was at the fore@@ front , because in a life on these clo@@ ist@@ ers , as a black , g@@ low woman is so much at stake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can feel their energy from the screen . &quot;
in the meantime , the news item in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on has gone long ago , but the rac@@ ted connections between the municipality and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rell asks for 2 ½ years because of the block@@ age of a highway on a demonstration .
it describes the soci@@ opoli@@ tical atmosphere of the area that it calls her home : &quot; a m@@ ess . &quot;
nevertheless they complain about a voc@@ als and she feels obliged to remember that since three years ago she went into F@@ erg@@ us@@ on to the road three years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we need to love each other and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; Si@@ w@@ ahn &quot; : TV @-@ reader on bit @-@ gallery
the bit gallery moves the people , although it is not yet built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping center at the southern shore of the pedestrian zone since the first presentation 2009 the population in advoc@@ ates and opponents .
cold leaves the subject to barely any one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also on our Facebook @-@ Page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will be discussed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; while the one to say a bit Gallery : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this would be a dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no human &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the advoc@@ ates build that there is a gallery more customers in the city , of which also the rest of business benefit , fear the opponents , that then the pedestrian prec@@ eding .
in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the property , on which the farmers market hall is mark@@ eted in the 13 multi@@ line markets .
the end of the construction works will thus be finished .
the Galerie @-@ M@@ acher want to integrate a Mark@@ thalle in the new hall - and for a room with possibility of sitting outside sitting .
Simone Rooms : &quot; we have been buying almost a week in the farmers market for many years .
mostly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the country racks always very will@@ ingly .
also the but@@ cher we have discovered for us .
we would like that during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is an opportunity to maintain this promotion .
in other cities there is also .
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially the small @-@ market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &apos; whether direct marketing in a market hall in the gallery , comes to the height of the rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it may not be very low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what &apos;s shopping in Bit@@ burg ?
if clothes , shoes , dru@@ g@@ ated or supermarkets : I find the su@@ perf@@ lu@@ ous .
of which there is enough in our city .
one can see how many charges are empty here - some for months and years .
but since it is not even a proper weekly market , it is all the more important that we have at least retained the market hall .
after all , the goods offered are fresh , is mostly offered directly from the producer and is ob@@ el@@ clean at the end .
as one sees , stores will be logged in a shopping centre only by bigger firms , as the dor@@ m mi@@ ets are often not viable for a retail@@ er .
too bad , special stores are almost no longer and that which is still left , then will probably also disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping center with a Mark@@ thalle will not fit together .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
above all , where should the peasant market hall during construction time ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even on duration if the bit gallery is actually going .
or does it create the Ges@@ pen@@ st bit gallery before to exp@@ el all business from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; this will simply not work .
and a shopping center that is empty , needs no one .
in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farmers market instead of this gallery .
but for a farmers market gi@@ b it is thanks to the w@@ ahn@@ sin@@ ess many - like I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in Bit@@ burg no longer place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if the farm@@ land is cap@@ aci@@ ed , a piece of culture will disappear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a suitable simil@@ arity : artist creates por@@ traits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
in the middle of the room of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which hang almost un@@ noticeable - that hang on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 por@@ traits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Tu@@ pf@@ ern and Hair cuts that you were sent by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the cuts from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth where the former sec@@ rec@@ y Analy@@ zer was able to ban@@ ded a 35 @-@ year sentence after they publicly made diplomatic reports on the site Wiki@@ Le@@ aks .
the new exhibition , which was opened on 2 August , means A Bec@@ oming res@@ embl@@ ance ( A suitable simil@@ arity ) .
it is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg whose discipline unite their expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ wife and land@@ mark , whose condem@@ nation was transformed by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been created by the algorithm analysis of DNA , which was extrac@@ ted by Mann@@ ing , as any intellectual comment could not only be interpreted with this gen@@ om@@ nia of DNA data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the in@@ dur@@ ated determin@@ ev@@ ism of these inter@@ pret@@ ations - but also created to identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but has already been openly discussed since her pu@@ ber@@ ty about the identification as a woman , it was condem@@ ned for 20 indic@@ ons , including six off@@ ences against Spi@@ on@@ ag@@ eg@@ es@@ etz , computer fraud and theft .
through the prison its picture was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gr@@ ated self @-@ adhesive , black @-@ white self @-@ continu@@ ance , in the Mann@@ ing clearly sits un@@ ease on a riding @-@ seat and a plat@@ former per@@ gap has been associated with it .
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came straight from the great success of their 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger S@@ ons &apos; .
it produced the artist &apos;s artist from stran@@ gers of for@@ ensi@@ c art@@ ef@@ acts and ch@@ ew@@ ing g@@ um by extracts the DNA out of the fall , in order to establish an image of how these people might look .
that was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a Tim@@ et@@ ag@@ azine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing , while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg near the new exhibition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and she was not visited at that time and she could not photograph@@ ed so she took contact with Chelsea in and asked them whether she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artists and their adh@@ er@@ ted M@@ use were replaced by un@@ equal bri@@ eff@@ ect@@ ators who re@@ plac@@ ements several letters over the course of two years .
it even created one of Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o illustr@@ ates Com@@ ic &quot; Supp@@ o Images , &quot; which would be pre@@ di@@ ct a future in which President Ch@@ ei@@ as Jud@@ gment would and it would be able to see the exhibition personally .
that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was released , Mann@@ ing release was asking for seven brut@@ al years in a military prison in Kan@@ sas , was a welcome type of happy meeting .
there are also now at the opening of the exhibition somewhat deep@@ es and Star@@ kes , since Donald Tr@@ ump goes a war against inform@@ ants from the governmental camp and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , res@@ um@@ able paths that he should actually fix , continue to infl@@ ame .
as De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg after the strange tim@@ ing of all these things was asked , she said that things are going to happen for a particular reason . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in one on the wall of the gallery held the artistic testimony of Mann@@ ing with their over@@ sized signature including ( the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; i &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in their sur@@ name ) is an end of the &quot; automatic &quot; &quot; &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , whose foundation has been gender , breed , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the opposite wall is their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ es of C@@ s and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hop@@ ed by integrating the 200 characters ( or nu@@ cl@@ oti@@ des according to the highly developed scientific l@@ ex@@ icon of the artist ) show how amazing , at least in biological ways , we all are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what people will hopefully bring about it is that our gen@@ ome is not about who we are and how openly genetic data are for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , also to be seen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so that &apos;s 30 of these stories . &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition which is kept in an own room is a page from the top @-@ mentioned com@@ ic Nov@@ elle .
she shows Mann@@ ing as she emerg@@ es with a Fre@@ is@@ diction in the hand from the disciplines of the United States such as King @-@ Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they make your speech , then they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we never stop the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter , which she has written me , &quot; said the artist , that ran out of Philadelphia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still get up go@@ ose when I talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was predic@@ ted in the com@@ ic book - but if they should do it , then they will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the mas@@ ks , which coll@@ ars themselves like hor@@ des of proteins .
this was also pur@@ pos@@ eful as everything was written in the exhibition until the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ atur ) , in which their genetic bit@@ ches were written with pencil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past I had them on the wall but I wanted to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted to feel that it feels like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement , which also hidden behind her liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of the University of North@@ western and an employee of the University of Oxford
a nation@@ wide female dog hunt is under@@ way for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford , who became known as susp@@ ects , after a man had been engaged in a luxury apartment in Chicago with fat@@ al injury .
on Monday for Wyn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) , because of their inn@@ umer@@ able participation in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au presented , as the Ak@@ ks of the Local Court of C@@ ook County show .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , after several stit@@ ches died .
a head@@ line of the police authority of Chicago published and published so that the le@@ che was discovered on July 27 .
officials received a call , came to the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several violations in his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was declared dead on the place of events for dead , and det@@ ective exam@@ ining the stit@@ ching as murder , while police are actively seeking the two susp@@ ects , said officials .
La@@ them has been an extraordinary Professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at North@@ western University .
Alan K. Cu@@ bb@@ age , Vice President for Universitäts@@ Relations , said in an e @-@ mail explanation , that La@@ them now has been quar@@ terly and excluded from the subject of the campus of North@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now an abstract issue that is investigated by the competent authorities and the North@@ western University operates in this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cu@@ bb@@ age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is a Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
a spok@@ es@@ man of the university and the Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail explanation that we are in contact with the police in Britain in contact and ready to help the US investig@@ ative authorities in every concei@@ vable manner . &quot;
the statement added that war@@ r@@ ens colleagues were sho@@ cked and want that he exhibited her .
Chief Communications officer of the Police Auth@@ orities of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said , he urge the susp@@ ects to ask the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police has a conception of their location , and our efforts to locate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building car@@ et@@ akers of the Grand @-@ Plaza building which had just received a mysterious tip that said in apartment 10@@ 08 .
the police described the scene as very cru@@ el .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was un@@ clear if the incident took place on 27 July .
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ them and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management team of Grand Plaza published a statement by the inhabitants : &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline , and the background of the offering , and investigate a variety of moti@@ fs , including a potential incident occurring .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will close the W@@ ada @-@ roadmap in the near future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Russian vi@@ zep@@ re@@ mi@@ er mut@@ u@@ alties . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Russian vi@@ zep@@ re@@ mi@@ er Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said , it won &apos;t take long before the remaining criteria in the world @-@ anti @-@ d@@ oping agency ( W@@ ada ) for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping agency ( R@@ US@@ ADA ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap R@@ US@@ ADA has the right to plan and test in collaboration with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK anti @-@ d@@ oping ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the W@@ ada @-@ roadmap was updated in this respect , &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday .
the PM comm@@ ited the second part of the roadmap of the W@@ ada to meet the code that describes the criteria for the re @-@ setting of R@@ US@@ ADA and recently published on the website of the organization .
according to Mut@@ ants , he does not contain anything that could cause Russia &apos;s cause .
&quot; everything was announced , everything is implemented .
and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( I@@ OC ) and the W@@ ada in the near future , &quot; he added .
one of the criteria listed in the list @-@ mentioned criteria is clear that the Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping authorities has to publicly accept the reported outcomes of by the W@@ ada lawyer by Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren and publicly funded PhD in Russian sports .
with regard to the matter said Mut@@ ko : &quot; we are leading the investigation by having made an error on our anti @-@ d@@ oping system .
all measures have been implemented .
but there were no state programs , and we will not ad@@ mit anything that doesn &apos;t exist . &quot;
mut@@ ually words vote with those of Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping Commission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; talking to the Russian sales point R@@ Sport at the beginning of the day there were Sm@@ ir@@ nov issues of the past in Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping organisations , then added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains contro@@ versi@@ al positions and regulations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no one has to accept this report un@@ condi@@ tionally , &quot; Sm@@ ir@@ nov added .
R@@ US@@ ADA was excluded in November 2015 in the course of the d@@ oping sc@@ and@@ als from the W@@ ada of execution of d@@ op@@ ing@@ es in Russia .
however , you have not been allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( U@@ K@@ AD ) .
after a visit to the main event of the organisation in Moscow in July , W@@ ada General Director Olivier Nig@@ gli , that R@@ US@@ ADA moved out in the right direction &quot; moved to again .

the start @-@ ups that will help your company not to become the next U@@ ber
Amy Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure the luck with your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up but the surveys do not work .
answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent .
and even if you pronoun@@ ced anonym@@ ity , some workers negl@@ ect to the process .
&quot; there was simply never consistency and obj@@ ectivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t who run the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ commerce Hair Care Society Ma@@ dison Reed .
it has called people from outside to help .
a new race of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is on w@@ axes to help companies out how their employees feel .
through creating and licens@@ ing of software , which has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement , it allows companies to offer surveys , specific@@ ity and complaint messages , and in some cases wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lowers , allow C @-@ suite executives to deal with and direct contact to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for the persecution of their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up Gl@@ int that is used by companies to measure workers commitment .
help she said that she has a better insight into what your employees think and feel with Gl@@ int in the three years .
in addition to the Sn@@ ap @-@ surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat @-@ card of the company that shows on a glance which units have most complaints and which managers have low level results - so you can hon@@ ors why .
companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture you have to stay , so that you have not been the next U@@ ber , who has been involved in Sk@@ and@@ ale since then a former employee has published a blog post , who talked about the environment that have spoken , pun@@ ished .
for start @-@ ups like gl@@ int this wish is for an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity .
the Global Governance , Regulation and Compliance @-@ industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion to the 2020 strategy , following the ir@@ respective technical website let &apos;s talk Pay@@ ments .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and recognize bad behaviour , saw a rising interest and activity beginning of this year in the middle of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alle in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
conver@@ cent has almost 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
u@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
like Gl@@ int , allows conver@@ cent companies tailor @-@ made &quot; pulse &quot; surveys send , tru@@ sting responses in real time collect and view the warmth maps of your problem areas .
it also provides an anonymous SMS line , with the staff can report bad behavior .
and if the main business leader is involved , complaints directly to the super@@ visory boards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Court of public opinion has captured the Reg@@ ulators , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Quin@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Conver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a company is found that his staff is bad or beha@@ ves badly or are un@@ ethical , it can experience precious consequences by consumers boy@@ cot@@ t , workers cur@@ k@@ tu@@ ation and cl@@ amping , said Quin@@ lan .
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 sites , Conver@@ cent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policy and procedures and have a simple way to achieve their corporate headquarters .
formerly an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company central , a formal complaint and hope that he was seriously taken .
it was often a timi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Co@@ uns@@ el , who said , there was no good way to follow the discomfort of employees .
now , since the company conver@@ ts conver@@ cent can problems that have previously been hidden by managers , who were hidden in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or in@@ compreh@@ en@@ sible tra@@ ine@@ - faster and addressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can closer to this holistic , 360 @-@ degree viewpoint into the experience with employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who runs the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders before employment and legal activities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
company began to take ethics , values and staff engagement in 2002 after the accounting company Arthur Ander@@ sen because of eth@@ eric bre@@ aches mer@@ ged by the En@@ ron @-@ sc@@ andal , said Quin@@ lan .
but it lasted until the &quot; Social Media &quot; came to their right , &quot; that companies know that you could not prevent their nar@@ row@@ ed laundry online .
&quot; before using technology for the monitoring of ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both Gl@@ int and conver@@ cent provide your software as a service to , and loaded the company with recur@@ ring charges for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance that takes the consent of Venture Capital investors who have supported both start @-@ ups .
conver@@ cent received $ 10 million in funding from companies such as Sap@@ phire Ventures and T@@ ola Capital , bringing the entire capital up to $ 47 million .
celeb@@ ri@@ culum $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture partner and carried out his entire financing to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising considering the inter@@ connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees are more expecting their jobs than before .
in competitive markets such as Sili@@ con Valley are high sal@@ aries and interesting projects for in@@ serts .
the employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you will spend your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if people are happy to be able to make their voices , and that the work that you do is worthwhile to make this company successful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and called Experience on Linked@@ In that both conver@@ cent as well as gl@@ int . &quot; &quot; &quot;
investors can reach R@@ end@@ on when its portfolio companies run well . companies run well if employees are working and engaged .
if the analytics tools of third promise , commitment and commitment to employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
data on staff members according to the experts of the workplace culture is important .
but the data is us@@ eless if the car@@ et@@ aker of a company has no measures to take .
in fact , if a company asks for your feedback , it can have an expect@@ ation that change is on the way .
and if change is not fast enough , or not at all , these dis@@ appointments can be breed and appropri@@ ately .
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you have to have prepared to have 4,000 talks , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen to rely heavily on collecting data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you do not follow the staff will ask you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you take care of that ?
and who does not take care of why should I ? &quot;
Ma@@ dison Reed , who now cros@@ ses monthly staff members , was able to initi@@ ate measures on the same day when a problem on Gl@@ int will be reported .
and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated staff , it was able to organize the decision @-@ making and quality of communication , capable to organize several teams within the company and add a communication training to tackle the problems .
for Ruby Tuesday , the company always receives new insights into the staff , and it hopes that in the long run , this leads to a better bond of workers in a industry that is known for high revenues .
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose the people , &quot; said Vit@@ rano .
&quot; and if you lose man , you also lose clients .
and if you lose clients , then you will lose companies .
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the Bru@@ ins
it is at 23 o &apos;clock , when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ ers enter@@ tained on one side of the new exercise fields of the team on the campus .
some have moved their tri@@ k@@ ot@@ ted parts and show the back full of swe@@ at from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team , these un@@ active minutes represent a mid@@ day break .
players who are ins@@ cribed to the summer courses , are returning after the three @-@ hour exercise to their final examination , before they return the next morning at 6 : 30 a.m. to the water@@ man Foot@@ ball Center .
&quot; that is for the guys the next three days a real tre@@ t@@ wind@@ mill , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before the Monday was Tuesday to Tuesday .
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminated two @-@ days exercises to facilitate the burden of players , and they have extended their days - at least until final on Friday .
therefore , the first three trainings in the U@@ C@@ LA should begin at 19 : 15 o &apos;clock in order to meet the already completed time sched@@ ules of the players .
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the break at the beginning of the Camp@@ s were postpon@@ ed almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six playing hours in West@@ wood practical exercises .
they should hold out in the course of August 18 exercises . 20 before the start of the formal chan@@ dis@@ ation for their pre@@ lu@@ de against Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he supports the control change of the N@@ CA@@ A even if they add a different part of the player to another point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this huge burden three or four days on them , and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they simply pushed it through , they plac@@ ken further , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think as soon as we arrive to Saturday and we have more time , it will really be great . &quot;
the U@@ C@@ LA will end its practices , as soon as the camp is termin@@ ated , which has been issued by the clear state of its fields from an adjacent parking place and the adjoining Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the up@@ scale class that is already covered with foot@@ prints , which will be a protective network behind a door@@ step , no easy task will be .
Bru@@ ins players should occupy the hotel from this weekend but Mor@@ a adm@@ its that there could be a problem once these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our security &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far fet@@ ched to think that people go there a room and then stop there to draw a exercise .
if you have the vide@@ ob@@ and from one exercise , it is quite a good deal .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces at parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
I am not too much worried about it .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with counter@@ s from third parties and show their results based on the original article , the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called f@@ ake news .
the company said in an opinion on his website that it will begin with the use of updated machines , to detect possible frac@@ tures and to send them to fact@@ sheets that may display results of the fact@@ sheet from the original article .
Facebook has been cri@@ tici@@ zed as one of the main points for so @-@ called f@@ ake news , of which many believe they have influenced the US presidential elections in 2016 .
the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , whereby the French voters have been floo@@ ded in May with false stories , and Germany supports a plan to be pun@@ ished after social media networks , if it did not succeed , hur@@ ried post@@ ings just before the elections there in September .
on Thursday Facebook told us in a separate declaration in English that in the US , France , the Netherlands and Germany will start a test of new facts .
&quot; in addition to finding out , which stories of fact@@ sheets are challenged , people want more context to make decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara Su , Produc@@ t@@ ress for Facebook @-@ News in a blog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook continue to be his feature to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; test article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and works on other changes to his news feed in order to reduce false news . &quot; &quot; &quot;
creation of a Com@@ ic @-@ Romans : a Castle in the History of England
in his recent past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was to be seen in a Squ@@ ee@@ ze music video , and was for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ he and 1980 @-@ he was a sh@@ ep@@ hole .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years a turbul@@ ent history of its cozy sitting in the P@@ ent River Valley in K@@ ent and is now facing inspiration for a graphical novel by Jam@@ ie Rhodes , a m@@ op@@ ha@@ ari@@ gen Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I find it so nice to look at the manus@@ cript of someone who has been dead since 300 years &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ a Castle in England &apos;s vol@@ tages from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another , coming British artist - Isaac Lenk@@ ie@@ wi@@ cz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isa@@ bel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book by Rhodes , based on an archive : he wrote 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he un@@ expected emotional .
&quot; I just responded to the thum@@ b pressure on the page of a letter to it that he was written by a double ag@@ enten in the 1700 @-@ er years , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is its perman@@ ence ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
and letters always sm@@ ells of smoke , because back then there was a fire of light due to the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he himself alone .
ah , I love Archive ! &quot;
for someone who runs with old papers is that he will be supported by National Trust and the Arts Council England and almost four months lived in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have been talking to my welcome ( ) ) it seems to be all too beautiful to be true .
Rhodes spent his days exploring the vi@@ kt@@ ori@@ ental &quot; new &quot; castle , to study the archives and study the many treasures and cur@@ ity of the castle , like the mon@@ ot@@ ted Hy@@ b@@ ans , on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch .
he emig@@ rated through the grounds and the ruins of the ancient castle and spoke with landscape sp@@ ines , gar@@ dener and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
then , at night he ate &quot; whis@@ key and started to write . &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , as the National Trust received full access when the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
as Rhodes a decade later , the staff first began to take care of the archive , which he said as &quot; hundreds of years , in which Arist@@ ok@@ es said , &quot; Oh , Cast it on the loft . &quot;
day@@ books , letters from the period of English Em@@ pi@@ res , maps , which poss@@ essed , &quot; you could mean that land @-@ fle@@ e would be boring , &quot; says Rhodes , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fight the two families .
guys , let &apos;s go all his way ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive on a broad base in the English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle , to join the peasant u@@ prising of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of a rebel@@ lion that appeared in 13@@ 80 in the castle in this book with the title &apos; K@@ nigh@@ tly Family of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , says Rhodes .
&quot; the farm arose in this area and I thought an u@@ prising was a good start .
maybe the two are linked together ? &quot;
other stories are firmly ro@@ oted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; that tells the story of the Jes@@ uit College , whom the family was hidden seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; in which the sm@@ ug@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rell received from the 18th century when he filled a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made later years later than its coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) .
the Dar@@ rel@@ ls are Rhodes &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gentlemen are going to be able to always make debt and spend money on things they could not afford .
other generations of Dar@@ rell @-@ men des@@ per@@ ate their debt crisis , as they married rich old women - I imagine they as a bunch of well @-@ looking boys before , with a talent to adver@@ tise Er@@ bin@@ nen . &quot;
after the end of his use in the castle Rhodes , looking for other unique write experiences
he has had a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a com@@ ic @-@ novel about El@@ se@@ amen , the grounds of a san@@ atori@@ ums from the early 20th century , which has since been recovered from nature again .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go again , &quot; he says .
it was like : &quot; Oh , now I have to cope with the dam@@ ten life . &quot;
campaign launched : more than 300 years old Mari@@ esi@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the veil@@ ing of the 301 year old Mari@@ enkirche in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf has started its campaign to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau of Thursday ) .
even until Thursday Mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team want to hold the logo and the slogan for Nelson .
at the end of August it is supposed to be a celebration of the campaign on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ ver@@ th .
&quot; too nice for us .
or ? &quot; ask the creators of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer Chapel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we think that ( of course ! ) do not really &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; write them released on her yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but we use this measure to gain your attention .
and to make clear that man@@ ches is better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in essence , we are the firm conviction that we as a bathroom Hon@@ our citizens know very well about the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the action there is more than &quot; just &quot; one logo and a slogan , it is called on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is to form@@ ulate a om@@ iting promise that gives the city an un@@ mist@@ ak@@ able drive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally they stand in the competition with other municipalities .
a central five @-@ digit amount is the city of Bad Honnef opens up its new umbrella brand and the campaign .
military reform in Turkey - Kur@@ dish fear of the army
every year in early August advis@@ es in Ankara of the Upper Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) on retirement and transportation in the officer cor@@ ps .
this is how this week also .
at first sight a normal procedure .
but nothing is routine for the Turkish forces a year after the cou@@ p attempt .
the meeting was not held in the building of the govern@@ s , as formerly , but at the office of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the consultation of the heads of the government also took part in the five c@@ zep@@ re@@ mi@@ ers as well as the Minister of Defence , Internal , Justice and External Action . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these were civilians in Y@@ AS in the number of transi@@ tions .
the government moves the bree@@ ders on the military .
general stab@@ sch@@ ef Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the com@@ man@@ ders of the army , the air ballo@@ on and the nav@@ y were de@@ posed .
since the failed cou@@ p has fi@@ red Erd@@ og@@ an 169 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of attached connections to the movement of exile , Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , the Erd@@ og@@ an as the wire pul@@ ling of the cou@@ p .
against 4@@ 86 people who must immediately participated in the cou@@ p attempt , will be negoti@@ ated in Ankara since this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already on the day after the cou@@ p Erd@@ og@@ an had called Erd@@ og@@ an as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worship &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as he give him the opportunity to clean the Ar@@ med For@@ ces &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but has Erd@@ og@@ an the army really under control ?
at the end of February the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article with the heading &quot; Un@@ beh@@ agen in the military @-@ head@@ quarter . &quot;
in the general governing board there are concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ isation &quot; of the army , which manif@@ ests itself among other things in the lifting of the head@@ scar@@ f ban for soldiers , wrote the newspaper .
the large cleaner at the army and the safety ju@@ ices continues at any rate .
in mid July Erd@@ og@@ an led by decre@@ e per decre@@ e further 73@@ 95 cou@@ riers , including 23@@ 03 gen@@ zi@@ sts and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
in doing so , it seemed like I have pe@@ aked the military on the military .
the gener@@ als were earlier than the actual masters of the country .
three times , she put@@ ted under calling on their role as guar@@ dian of the world@@ ly state order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to his election , 2002 , Erd@@ og@@ an the power of the military &apos;s step by step back , not least by calling on calling for the reform of the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
former officers say , Erd@@ og@@ an t@@ rei@@ a targeted a Islam@@ isation of the armed forces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Voc@@ al Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Voc@@ al Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war@@ ned a well @-@ called officers , who sought after the put@@ sch test out of fear of persecution abroad , the Turkish army will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ af@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
meets that it could not be such development the N@@ ato is not cold .
in any case , in the Alliance , there are doubts about the cleans@@ ing of the Turkish army .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the management structures and operational capabilities be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; say N@@ ato diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington is changing the rules for the Green Card
there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of Green Card , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , c@@ ited by the media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he looks ahead to lower the legal immigrants in the 5@@ 0,000 per year , more str@@ ingent regulations for gaining visa for satisfying work permit and restrictions for families @-@ oriented visa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Republi@@ cans and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , save wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers , and will do this by the US will change the way that people from other countries will be spent Green Cards &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent the chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this new application procedure will come to the candidates who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge which will benefit from our economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump , c@@ ited by American media . &quot; &quot; &quot;

again , over the past few months the future of the race track has been argu@@ ed - now it is supposed to go fast .
even before the end of the year , on the other side of the year , on which the tourist train goes , will be built .
in order to secure the future of the increase in the long term , according to the ministry of the ministry , according to the ministry of the ministry we will commen@@ ce this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to further order the course of Il@@ menau @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country becomes especially important for tourism &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; stated traffic @-@ secret@@ ary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Erfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs for the commissioning of the track is approximately 2.5 million euros .
the country gets 75 per cent from this total .
the contract , on which the shuttle is to be ordered in the future from the country , it is currently being completed , explained S@@ üh@@ l .
the Ministry and the South@@ th@@ ür@@ ingen railway as an operator are already familiar with the technical details .
&quot; this means the roadmap to tra@@ ded the used vehicles and the quality standards , &quot; &quot; S@@ üh@@ l &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
this means that the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle will be ordered at the end of December 2017 .
the race track shuttle is an especially popular tourist cable between the stations of Il@@ menau and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
during the past few months in the course of a pilot &apos;s company , the circuit is used by sufficient many people to order them again in future .
the track is also very heavy in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real , and we should worry
just as you thought it cannot be more crazy at 2017 , a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots .
yes , actually .
sex robots are currently a great thing .
recently released the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ) ( FR@@ R ) a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , em@@ eri@@ ti@@ erter Professor of Robotics and Arti@@ ficial intelligence at the University She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we must begin to take their rise seriously .
customers can choose the eye @-@ color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of fo@@ g harv@@ esting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people make themselves funny , but the companies deliver a lot of it , and we will see them much more often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Shar@@ key during the publication of his new report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern sex@@ es have evolved from their infl@@ atable partners to rob@@ otic partners with a sili@@ cone , which feels warm up - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
the user can also adjust its robots even according to his con@@ vic@@ tions , &quot; and you can select all the color of the robot via the form of the ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or the color of his ring .
but there will be more wor@@ rying , as many robots have the &quot; person@@ alities &quot; who would look like a Step@@ ford @-@ woman .
modern sex doll@@ s have developed to robot with a sili@@ cone skin .
the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robots makes it possible for example to adapt their robots to the properties that will find it pleas@@ ing like rel@@ ap@@ ness .
and then there is the True &apos;s Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex @-@ robot with pre@@ programmed person@@ alities like &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which con@@ veys the impression of rel@@ ap@@ ness and &quot; Wild Wendy &apos;s &quot; with a &quot; advent@@ uro@@ us &quot; personality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality , which is adapted as good as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war@@ med the website of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; True Compan@@ ion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so much they like , what you like , and they don &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
she has her m@@ oods in the course of the day - really like real people !
it can be tired , fixed upon conversation or it may be &quot; in mood ! &quot;
there are many wor@@ rying aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the lower female characteristics , the play@@ ings in rap@@ e ( is called here : ir@@ ref@@ ende ) Far@@ rah goes , be@@ un@@ quiet a most .
on his website is True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a VI@@ BR@@ ATOR , but for males .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if women ( si@@ c ) can have a VI@@ BR@@ ATOR , why do men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just just another sex toys .
their emergence and the increasing sophis@@ tic@@ ation point to something dark and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the Ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with subj@@ ection to an optional addition .
most men will of course no longer notice sex robots , and while the FR@@ R noted its rising pop@@ ularity , but still remain provisi@@ onal on the edge of consumer culture .
but what was cor@@ rup@@ ed from the edge @-@ zones can be in terms of the spirit of time in which we live , very instruc@@ tive .
and many people are not od@@ d or bel@@ ei@@ ve until them the free market there is their permission .
there is a certain over@@ cut that these highly developed sex robots are threatened in a while in which the rights of women are threatened globally , in which there is a president in the White House who has been co@@ ined to have women sex@@ ually attacked .
the de@@ terr@@ ent aspect of the television series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the Mag@@ d &apos;@@ ) are not the graphical images , the fu@@ eled body and the extinct eyes , but how realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but in the moment it does not feel like a big leap .
the target behind these sex robots is to establish a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( if also with Por@@ no@@ star propor@@ tions ) .
your buil@@ ders want them to feel human , that they are the movement of a real body .
however , on the point when it comes to their &quot; person@@ alities , &quot; the robots are no real women .
you cannot separate yourself from their companion or simply go away .
they have no placement or a background of the background , nothing , which indicates to independence or anything , which might inter@@ f@@ ere to the imagination .
to put in other words : they are counter@@ productive slaves .
or to express it in the prec@@ urs@@ days of 2017 : maid
m@@ umps large performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney to the term of a healthy human mind
it has become a conn@@ ect@@ edness of the tr@@ ump era that the political divisions which have pol@@ ari@@ zed the U.S. elect@@ or@@ ate even families in small @-@ format .
around Christmas and harvest festival existed in the USA newspapers with advice on how to cope with the hor@@ ror of tr@@ ump dimensions .
we all supp@@ os@@ edly permit all of us to burst our filter bu@@ b@@ bles .
less noticed is the power of m@@ umps to co @-@ together .
I chose this because my c@@ ous@@ ins , a left @-@ oriented se@@ er , who lives in Chicago and has long lived with the re@@ public@@ ans in our family who visited me this week in New York .
they remin@@ ded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with dr@@ ump in the White House everyone is known to know the she , including the Republi@@ can relationship , fought with her decades , suddenly and quite od@@ d on the same side .
around the dining table this is certainly a good thing , but it dis@@ agree with me in a wider context that this also brings significant risks to it .
the left was strengthened by dre@@ ump , but the de@@ vot@@ al effect of his presidency did the power to push us all to the right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when we speak of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; norm@@ alize &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and g@@ ump , we refer to the cru@@ el@@ ly possibility that we could no longer rep@@ el his places of a day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , there is a still scar@@ f long @-@ time scenario , in which the ump of Republi@@ can of the right wing , &quot; norm@@ alized &quot; which suddenly appears in comparison to its standards as in@@ compreh@@ en@@ ite of reason@@ abl@@ eness .
I find myself nowadays by an active no@@ stal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ neys , the dog at the Aut@@ od@@ ach , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how its tax return ) - both in comparison to tr@@ ump in fact occur a rather mild Stra@@ ights .
when tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the Republi@@ can only be spirit@@ ually healthy in order to qualify as im@@ meas@@ urable improvement .
when my c@@ ous@@ ins was in the city , we brought our children to the Kar@@ us@@ sell abroad , the largest of the Kar@@ uss@@ ells of New York &apos;s Park department , and the top three dollars that one can spend in the city if one needs a caffeine .
the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass design on the central cylin@@ ders - all c@@ low@@ ns are cold , and the animals rot@@ ate themselves to look upon their own shoulders - extremely dark and the clim@@ atic music con@@ veys this in a strange way .
so many acc@@ us@@ ees of a city dis@@ ap@@ point : the views of high buildings are old , the sky@@ lines are becoming familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream .
five @-@ five years later , and I am still not quite busy over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is in fact no Swiss cottage - the theme pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not - but a big roundabout in the north of London .
the Central Park car@@ ou@@ sel is still a strange magical experience , since here two years old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women can go on it and all have a great time .
if I could have been able to evaluate the car@@ ou@@ sel , I would have given him the total score , but fortunately no man has asked for it .
on the other hand , I was forced to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before I could go through my credit card .
in the Coffee @-@ House on the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to finish the score with a 15 % drinking - this to buy something about the shop .
this not only leads to a slow@@ ing of what should actually be a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no need is required .
the poor woman in the department of buying was exc@@ ell@@ ently , while I tired of experience he made my credit card with five stars .

as Bauer Arnold a strange egg is found
as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the neighbor@@ hoods of F@@ ishers and E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen were released into the holidays and into the further schools .
three of the dem@@ ol@@ it@@ ates go in future at the Gymnasium , four to the Real@@ school .
Schul@@ er Angelika Pl@@ te greeted with parents and representative of the public in the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen .
we chose the 29 students of four classes under the direction of Sophia Schum@@ acher and Reg@@ ine Meder a young eag@@ le , who grows in the Ch@@ ick@@ n@@ erhof , but still being released into freedom .
to this , the m@@ under@@ e Sch@@ ar led a musical with the title &quot; The eag@@ le in the Ch@@ ick@@ n@@ erhof . &quot;
Bauer Arnold was a strange egg , and he caused it to bur@@ sts of his ch@@ ick@@ ens .
instead of a chicken , a small eag@@ le came out .
but the hope of making him a chicken , sm@@ ote , the eag@@ le spread over a high mountain its wings and escap@@ ed .
after that , the classes showed three and four in the single @-@ phase of Y@@ vonne Frank a chicken .

the eag@@ le stand for the integration , said Schul@@ er Angelika S@@ te .
the vir@@ al may be different from the other young animals ( ch@@ icks ) , but they belong .
but he will never be like a chicken .
his purpose is to be free .
they wished each quarter of the quar@@ rel that he feels in his new school .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it followed Dan@@ th@@ d to the colleagues , the former school leaders Michael Müller , who has always jump again at ped@@ ago@@ gues , and the parents representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ch@@ ick@@ er time is now over , explained class instruc@@ tive Sophia Schum@@ acher .
they leave their students after two years of lessons very well because it had been a really great time .
finally , I have left her on the quarters of the past .
for the conclusion , all students left a song of summer time and holidays .
it was great joy in the children .

software Update for Diesel vehicles : what people need to know now
how accurate does the software update take place ?
need to participate diesel drivers in the promotion ?
the most important questions and answers .
at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW @-@ Group software offers available for a total of around 5,@@ 3 million cars .
they are supposed to improve the emissions of emissions of emissions from 5 and partly Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ diesel or worse are exemp@@ t from it .
Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in from ACE Auto Club Europe gives assess@@ ments :
is the new action compulsory ?
no , the tra@@ ded software updates are optional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the binding updates were only valid for the vehicles , the Schum@@ an software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their retro@@ fitting has arranged the drive @-@ Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed of updates ?
the makers have announced an independent implementation in the coming months , but not yet called an exact date .
Daimler has informed to write any person concerned .
if any in@@ spec@@ tion is due , it will be done in their context .
how long should the or@@ ge@@ ars remain in total ?
&quot; difficult to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ an@@ in .
it is due to the commitment of the manufacturer as well as of political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have seen voluntary sur@@ rendered the car manufacturers on the subject of environment so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update last ?
the refur@@ bish@@ ment itself could last in the workshop only three to four hours .
time @-@ elaborate could be to get an appointment .
what makes drivers , who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW @-@ Group ?
the ACE will be waiting for waiting .
probably foreign manufacturers would move , so S@@ met@@ an@@ in .
is now a massive price loss of Euro @-@ 4 @-@ cars ?
the ACE is fear@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but even in the regions , where driving is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fahr@@ ote &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in rural areas there has so far been no added value for older diesel .

we make the city liv@@ able
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadtbau@@ meister , continues in the coming year in R@@ ente .
the job is already written - suitable applic@@ ants are r@@ ar .
since 31 years W@@ acker Stadtbau@@ meister .
and the work always makes him great fun as he con@@ veys on the pressing group .
he will report by varied , but also challenging tasks that await his successor .
at the same time ad@@ mi@@ red him that no application will fill the application profile .
the city seeks a architects or construction engineers at the next time .
thus , in consideration of the regular dism@@ iss@@ al fri@@ es - still enough time for a development .
da Has@@ lach for the administrative community as sub @-@ rights authority , the applic@@ ant must advance the applic@@ ants .
because this function will definitely be kept .
if they cannot fill out this anymore , citizens would have to drive consulting to Off@@ enburg .
but Bür@@ g@@ ern@@ ä@@ he is the city and he himself important , says W@@ acker , who reported by a good working environment as well as good atmosphere between authority and citizens .
in more than 30 years in office , some important projects have accumul@@ ated to look back at the W@@ acker with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city live , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is safe across the building and its staff is safe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future are varied projects on the agenda : the re@@ mod@@ elling of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ as and of the low @-@ parking place .
the chin bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium @-@ rolling is still subject .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter alone will strike around 1.5 million euros with be@@ ech , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do it correctly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appreci@@ ates W@@ acker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; all in all waiting great tasks for my successor .
the work here is fun . &quot;
designed for a Stadtbau@@ meister of large scope .
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s own Bau@@ hof and G@@ är@@ t@@ ner@@ ei could be quite flexible to it .
&quot; one can move far , &quot; says W@@ acker , and the design of the founding facilities will often commen@@ dable by citizens and visitors .
as the old town as an ensemble is under monument protection , it is important to have &quot; an eye to have what rein@@ for@@ ks , &quot; when new builds are approved , the separ@@ ative Stadtbau@@ meister .
anyway , the Stadtbau@@ meister is a high responsibility .
he is belly , &quot; at the end everything runs here about my table . &quot;
in care and coordination he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neum@@ ai@@ er ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been serving Manfred Schön@@ er ( Tief@@ ental ) for more than 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also that his successor is long , wishes W@@ acker : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really identified and want to stay with the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good working environment but also for the further development of the city .
wh@@ o@@ ever wants to be@@ have Roland W@@ acker , should provide information about the city of Has@@ lach a closed study as a diplom@@ acy or PhD with expert architecture and have good expertise in the areas of construction and construction rights .

bike mounted on lines cast : southern track closed
according to police previously announced the blue bicycle from the rail@@ road pass in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Street ( B@@ 116 ) .
these were so badly damaged that the prot@@ est@@ ation must be hal@@ ted .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male perpet@@ rat@@ ors and are looking for the bed@@ time after them .
near the Tat@@ ort had been observed by witnesses a pink sco@@ oter and a bike @-@ driver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond Lausanne , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB @-@ Spe@@ aker Christoph Pos@@ ch &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the or perpet@@ rat@@ ors could have put themselves in large danger and also endang@@ ers the train .
in addition to the damage to the L@@ ok and the plant , as well as the late @-@ car drive and the cost of rail tran@@ sports they could also provide shut@@ ters of the rail@@ ways to the perpet@@ rat@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; overall be of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; significant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damages were re@@ medi@@ ed on the Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the southern track could be led without disabilities .
just ten persons , we had fallen in late morning , two of whom see the correspondence .
Gü@@ ter@@ pts were not falling , but they had del@@ ayed .
according to Ö@@ BB @-@ Spe@@ aker Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be replaced approximately 200 meters of bur@@ ns .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
rot@@ es meat , dairy products and chocolate could help IB@@ D ( infl@@ amm@@ ation intest@@ inal diseases )
rot@@ es meat and chocolate can sound for your diges@@ tive system like a night@@ mare .
but a new study claimed exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could soo@@ the the symptoms of patients with infl@@ amed bow@@ el disease .
the incur@@ able state that affects the USA around 1.3 million and in Great Britain 300@@ ,000 causes stomach @-@ f@@ ights and bli@@ sters , recur@@ ring or blo@@ ody break@@ down , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
while those afflic@@ ted usually get rid of meat and dairy products out to soo@@ the their symptoms , researchers found at the Wash@@ ing@@ ton@@ er University out that the essential amino acid must contribute tr@@ yp@@ top@@ h@@ ane of proteins to develop immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant intest@@ inal .
the leading researchers , Dr. Marco Colonna , declared that immune cells in the gut , to ensure that dam@@ aging micro@@ bes , which hide themselves in the food , not penet@@ rate into the body .
cells that are capable of infl@@ am@@ using infl@@ amm@@ ation , are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without in@@ sensitive tissues .
when the balance is too far towards infl@@ amm@@ ation , it may result from infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory intest@@ inal disease .
in experim@@ entation has been established that a kind of tolerance subsi@@ ding immun@@ isation occur in mi@@ ce , which carry a certain bacter@@ ium in their bow@@ els .
and the bacter@@ ium need tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the blocks of proteins in order to det@@ ach the appearance of the cells .
Professor Colonna said : &quot; we have made a connection between a bacter@@ ial art - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the intest@@ inal micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han had the mi@@ ce in their food , the more they had of these imm@@ unity . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han rich diet toler@@ ant , less infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory intest@@ inal mi@@ lie@@ us promotes , when the same system will work with people .
the Post@@ d@@ ok@@ tor@@ and@@ in Dr. Luisa Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an under@@ sought a kind of imm@@ uni@@ sts that promotes tolerance than they had found that a group of university tastes such cells had , but another group of des@@ erts that was not separated .
they susp@@ ected that the difference with the intest@@ inal micro@@ bi@@ al of the mi@@ ce had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and mushrooms which usually live in the gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal tract .
the har@@ nesses of the mi@@ ce were found DNA sequ@@ ential and there were six bacter@@ ial cards found in the mi@@ ce with the immune cells , but without them were missing with the mi@@ ce .
mi@@ ce were re@@ ared in a ster@@ ile environment so that they did not have a intest@@ inal micro@@ bi@@ ome and they did not developed this kind of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
to understand how the bacteria re@@ acted to the immune system , the researchers can grow L. reu@@ ter@@ i in a fluid and then conducted small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ri@@ pe immune cells that have been isolated from the mi@@ ce .
the immune cells developed into the toler@@ ant cells .
when the active component was pur@@ ged from the liquid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ met@@ abo@@ lic , which is known as an in@@ do@@ l @-@ 3 @-@ l@@ actic acid .
if the researchers re@@ dou@@ bled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ h@@ ane in the for@@ age of the mi@@ ce , the number of such cells rose by around 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ ical values were hal@@ ved , decreased the number of cells around half .
Dr. Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an explained that people have the same toler@@ ant cells such as mi@@ ce , and that most of us protect L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal tract .
it is not known if Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ epi@@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i have found cells in people like on mi@@ ce , but def@@ ective in genes in relation to Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with anti @-@ infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ern@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the development of these cells is probably something we want to promote since these cells control their infl@@ amm@@ ation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
potentially can lead to the expansion of this pop@@ up at the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho thinks that Manchester United has committed a &quot; geni@@ us &quot; with Nem@@ an@@ ja M@@ atic
Manchester United has signed a &quot; geni@@ us &quot; with Nem@@ an@@ ja M@@ atic , &quot; believes Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut on Wednesday evening against S@@ amp@@ dor@@ ia .
the 40 million pound Signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game , before the U@@ EFA @-@ Super @-@ Cup against Real Madrid starts on Tuesday , and impressive in the semi @-@ role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira to Beli@@ ev@@ ched .

&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a geni@@ us in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will help him to be ready earlier than later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three of four to get , I thank the association , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Boeing &quot; m@@ alt &quot; Dream@@ liner into the sky
the U.S. aircraft Boeing has the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner into the sky .
the pilots fle@@ w from Seattle in the US state Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in US @-@ State Michigan , and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and one minute .
on the wheel@@ chairs , the shape of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers was to be .
this whole was a endurance for new engines .
Boeing had previously made such commercial advertising earlier .
thus the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing @-@ logo in the sky was painted .
new pre@@ cip@@ itation for Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a problem
&quot; &quot; &quot; how the wind turned out : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Sig@@ mar Gabriel , the SPD member was , looked at social @-@ democratic prime minister before elections always with a certain concern after Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only no stor@@ y@@ fire from the Party cent@@ red , merely no counter @-@ wind from the covenant - so loud the most important wish of the elect@@ oral campaigns .
since Martin Schulz the party has radic@@ ally changed this .
since then , the employees of the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ House are watching with growing discharge the events in the SPD @-@ governed national cities .
what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year , head@@ winds would not take place in the approach .
there were depths .
and one after another .
the CD@@ U @-@ CD@@ U looks after the surprisingly end of the red @-@ green majority in Nieder@@ s@@ achsen , a general signal against co@@ ali@@ tions of SPD and Gre@@ ens .
&quot; this shows once more : red @-@ green is simply not able to go@@ vern , &quot; said CD@@ U @-@ Secretary General Peter Tau@@ ber the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
the surprising fraction of a Green MEPs influenced the government of Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SD@@ P ) in a serious crisis .
five months before the election @-@ elections put his red @-@ green coalition with it its A @-@ votes @-@ majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green @-@ Bundes@@ bus@@ ch leader Michael Kell@@ ner has asked the Ab@@ sin@@ ful Nieder@@ s@@ äch@@ s@@ ische Grünen @-@ members of the Ni@@ ke T@@ ue , to return to their mandate .
the transition to CD@@ U means a clear pre@@ cip@@ itation of the voters .
El@@ ke T@@ hou must immediately back her mandate , &quot; said the Federal executive director and elect@@ oral campaign of the Gre@@ ens Network Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must not be true at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; si@@ gh a SPD elect@@ oral campaigns as on the opening morning the new Hi@@ ob@@ s@@ bot@@ schaft achieved the party central . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan W@@ eil , SPD Prime Minister of Nieder@@ s@@ achsen , stands for the survi@@ vor@@ s of the green Members of El@@ ke T@@ ets to CD@@ U without their own ruling majority .
it is the provisi@@ onal highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in the SPD country .
and no one knows what comes next .
the mis@@ ery began with the un@@ expected defeat at the Saar@@ land election in March .
a blue eye , more not , cal@@ med the com@@ rade @-@ time .
after the National@@ rats@@ wahlen in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and Nordrhein @-@ Westfalen , everything will be different .
that was it then - and indeed everything was clearly worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to Tau@@ m@@ eln , the Düsseldorf @-@ pl@@ eite Haute the party smooth .
effort@@ less r@@ ushed the comrades in the weeks after that again .
then when she had just shot new courage , the G @-@ 20 Summit was from Hamburg .
and with him the next draft came .
Mayor Olaf Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD @-@ Land@@ esch@@ ef , abandoned at that weekend his Nim@@ bus , because he sat in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie , while his city burned down .
and because he made quite a false communication in the crisis communication , that is what you can do wrong .
since then , Sch@@ olz has been fighting for its political survival .
now also Stephan W@@ eil .
due to the VW @-@ Ab@@ gas@@ aff@@ aires and its role in the super@@ visory boards , the Nieder@@ s@@ äch@@ s@@ ische Minister has been in criticism for a longer time in criticism .
mi@@ ese Re@@ surveys came on .
nevertheless , or maybe just that , W@@ eil tried to put more and more strongly in the Bund in the past weeks .
the aim of the former citizens of Hanover , to develop its power in Berlin remained hidden in the environment of Martin Schulz as well .
they let him grant him because they dism@@ iss the stabil@@ isation of the party from W@@ eil .
well the exact opposite could occur .
w@@ eil as part of the party internal atomic force is basically no gu@@ ilt .
and Mr Schulz not at all .
you make every effort the comrades have to keep their own ranks closed .
her wrath is set out on the Gre@@ ens , and here especially to the Ab@@ sin@@ ful female parliament@@ arians T@@ ent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and more democratic , as Ms T@@ ells their own care@@ ers over the interests of all the other , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ ers@@ ch , Chief of the Party left in the SPD parliamentary group , the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ms. T@@ west is not elected for her person as a direct candidate , but on the State of the Dutch Gre@@ ens in parliament , so the Nieder@@ s@@ äch@@ s@@ ische Dep@@ uty continues .
the logical consequence would be that she returns their mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , Chief of the SPD parliamentary group , indic@@ ted a &quot; un@@ democratic man@@ eu@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; the elect@@ or@@ ate four years ago was clear : the people have made Stephan W@@ eil as a prime minister , &quot; says Su@@ per@@ mann , who runs the Nieder@@ s@@ äch@@ s@@ ische SPD as a nickname candidate to the Bundestag .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the personal career of a future CD@@ U MEPs will vote the vote @-@ vote &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he requested the background to be clari@@ fied .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to know if there has been more or there continued commitment by the CD@@ U Lower Saxony . &quot; &quot; &quot;
funding for the Center III
who wants to be gentle to the years may soon get support from the country .
about the informal Mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representative St@@ eg urban development on Wednesday in delicate .
at the beginning of the information seminar , Sch@@ in@@ dler gave once again a review of that previously failed .
since 1991 it has been shed in sensitive renovation areas .
at that time , in the refur@@ bish@@ ment area I from 1991 to 2004 , the Land of Baden @-@ Württemberg has taken over two thirds of the group .
in the refur@@ bish@@ ment area II from 2005 to 2016 , the grant was still at 60 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Sch@@ in@@ dler , the previous renovation projects are a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; successful &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - it &apos;s finally important to promote the interior development , and not only develop new construction areas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on April 4th you have received the information of the Intergovernmental Conference in Karlsruhe l@@ ends that there will be a refur@@ bish@@ ment area III .
the sum total g@@ os@@ age 8@@ 33 333 euros , of which 500 000 euros from the country , the rest of the municipality received .
how is a re@@ organisation ?
one will continue to examine so in@@ dler , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are .
but it also plays a role if in the planned territory should at all be amazed at all .
if necessary , the regions could then be postpon@@ ed again .
the pier represented at the Mit@@ tw@@ och@@ evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; cellar presented the contents of the federal state @-@ country &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where the renov@@ ations would then be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
core of the program are the Rev@@ ital@@ isation of Inn@@ enst@@ äd@@ ten , enhancing housing and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure .
the measures would have object @-@ related , that is called per plot .
the re@@ organisation would eventually be defined as a stat@@ ute .
the permit period for funding funds has been ongoing since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
even until September this year , however , the inventory would only be carried out at once , in the context of those who fill out a questionnaire to filling out a questionnaire .
in November or December the pro@@ posi@@ tional test should be made , so that in the coming year will be started with the renov@@ ations .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann explained that each municipality can perform the poss@@ essions pre @-@ investigations .
it is about evaluating and decide the municipal miss@@ able mis@@ sil@@ es , and to decide when to be san@@ ded and to what extent .
for the respective property there will also be a re@@ frac@@ ture in the basic book .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will once again get received , and get a picture of the situation , she spoke .
Got@@ zel empha@@ sized a key success factor for the project was the participation of the participants .
therefore , there will be question@@ n@@ aires who will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and will be filled up until the end of the summer holidays .
the gel@@ be Ques@@ tion@@ naire is the &quot; building and the bows , &quot; in which it is among other things about the structural condition and san@@ itation .
in the grey Ques@@ tion@@ naire , the &quot; household and residential area , &quot; you can get information about size , distribution and residents of a living room .
the blue &quot; working bow &quot; is only to complete if in building commercial rooms are operated .
however , to be noted , de@@ d.@@ zel definitely pointed out that a mark@@ er questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , new construction measures are not condu@@ ci@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sch@@ in@@ dler emphas@@ ised that the distribution of funding funds after &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wind and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; working &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - who first comes first .
one cannot book funding for later . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in conclusion , pictures of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Local Center II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was shown to make the present a restau@@ ration &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
British invent@@ ors himself sets up a micro@@ chip in order to come into house and car with a hand@@ movement
one bri@@ tish invent@@ ors is the first in the country , which is equipped with a micro chip so that he can enter his door@@ step , and even start his car with a hand@@ movement .
Steven North@@ am , 33 , had impl@@ anted the tiny chip between Dau@@ men and fore@@ finger and now provides service for businesses and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q .

the technology resem@@ bles a cats and dogs impl@@ anted micro@@ chip , and only lasts 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. North@@ am wants to change the locks of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for a surcharge of £ 300 per Castle .

the advertising costs of the White House will cost the tax@@ pay@@ ers .
the decision of the White House , a nav@@ y hel@@ ic@@ opter to fly for an event that highlights the American production last month , costs tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the indications of the military that have been left to the TI@@ ME Magazine , up to 24,@@ 000 US dollars .
the green white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on 17 July in the White House with American construction programmes .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and executive officials of the White House made a circuit through products from all 50 countries .
the hel@@ ic@@ ut @-@ made hel@@ ic@@ opter was issued beside a yacht from Maine , a fire@@ man from Wis@@ cons@@ in and a for@@ kli@@ ft in Mississippi .
the military office of the White House slow@@ ed the presence of the hel@@ ic@@ opter in a frag@@ ment@@ ary order or FRA@@ GO , barely 36 hours before the hel@@ ic@@ opter at the South La@@ wn S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit which is responsible for the operation of the hel@@ ic@@ opter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just wanted to be aware of it because it is an ever@@ common event with high visibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the com@@ man@@ de@@ ur of H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event of its super@@ visor , the dep@@ uty nav@@ al level . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message showed that the hel@@ ic@@ opter arrived on 17 July at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning at the South La@@ wn for the event at 15 o &apos;clock , and so long stayed to the law@@ ns between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 p.m. on this evening .
the note adds that if the departure should be del@@ ayed from the White House , due to the restriction of the service , a second team would need for the return flight .
the original stat@@ utes was at the event of hel@@ ic@@ opter , while the safety of the unit remained on the ground during the period during the period .
the records made available from the TI@@ ME provided no clearly whether a second flight number was required .
the H@@ atch Act ver@@ provides Bundes@@ minist@@ ered , State ownership for political purposes .
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 was asked if the event could hurt the destination .
&quot; one question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch A@@ cts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the com@@ mander .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds , as if you are closed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; answering the Dep@@ uty command . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the &quot; Made in America &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not be covered by the H@@ atch Act .
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the president gave a impetus to reform of the health reform , which was under@@ way in the Senate , and he com@@ pressed the efforts to rest@@ ment the government regulations .
the use of the aircraft , which is known as Marine One or Air Force One , for politically advant@@ ageous purposes is not a new phenomenon .
President are oblig@@ ated to use them for the journey .
but to demand their use only for a photo @-@ OP , is un@@ common .
tr@@ ump led an investigation in February than the presidential plane in front of his first Kamp@@ agn@@ en@@ r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that exam@@ ines the use of the presidential flight through its predecessor .
&quot; the White House is enthusiastic about the show &quot; Made in America &quot; - the products from all 50 countries which are manufactured by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the dep@@ uty secret@@ ary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 occup@@ ations often perform training flights in the area around Washington and the South La@@ wn through to dep@@ loy the U.S. president in the White House with precise Zen@@ tim@@ eters .
as a tr@@ ump in early July at the G@@ 20 Summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 was conducted in the White House 58 Ex@@ erc@@ ing land@@ ings .
the flight for the &quot; Made in America &quot; event mat@@ tered with the training Stat@@ utes for the month , said an official .
Hel@@ i@@ kop@@ ter units fle@@ w 11 hours to this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support . &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pay@@ ers took the burden for any of the other re@@ pro@@ ps that were presented at the event .
a spok@@ es@@ person of Si@@ kor@@ sky said , the company was not involved in pat@@ ching the hel@@ ic@@ opter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not matter bud@@ get@@ ary records for the presidential term , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to St@@ and@@ ent@@ ari@@ fen of the U.S. Defense Ministry for the fiscal year 2017 , the DO@@ D Re@@ placement of the V@@ H @-@ 3D is however 24.@@ 380 USD per flight @-@ hour .
records of the unit , the flight time of the plane crash at 30 minutes from the hom@@ age of Marine Cor@@ ps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House argu@@ ed that the actual cost of running the hel@@ ic@@ opter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers based on estimates for the proposals is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs , which are included in the annual means . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a margin from the year 2015 , the in@@ serts for DO@@ D does not include the costs for DO@@ D , but consider the costs for fuel , maintenance and contract conclusion .
at this time the former press spok@@ es@@ men of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , the use of hel@@ ic@@ opter for the event .
&quot; the idea is to present these weekly things which are produced in America , &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the federal state Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud of that they contribute to our national security , and I &apos;m assum@@ ing that hundreds , if not even thousands of people are dependent on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think like most Americans are all proud of hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ters and other military equipment , for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ reless .
it is of course adequate that highlight it . &quot;
it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump was inter@@ acting with the hel@@ ic@@ opter , when he joined his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver of a fire@@ man .
in the White House Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and j@@ ok@@ ing with the media through his own fleet of company products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have three of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of tri@@ cky task
leaders of the Second tennis Bundes@@ liga jo@@ ins the Tab@@ ell@@ end@@ ritten Su@@ chs@@ dorfer SV on .
the TC blue @-@ Weiss Ne@@ uss is coming tomorrow at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel at the Tab@@ ern@@ end@@ ritten Su@@ chs@@ dorfer SV .
despite these five games , the leader of the Second tennis Bundes@@ liga has received the sense of reality .
teamwork Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has any respect for your opponent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team that is always played in quite similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; just in the back positions I find the team very well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dorfer SV mainly take imports from the high north .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their plans and Finn@@ s can even refer to events in the Davis Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and they are also strong in the double , &quot; says Z@@ ay overlooking Har@@ ri Hel@@ i@@ ova@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andre Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben Ol@@ esen , Martin Peder@@ sen and Andreas Bj@@ ör@@ hus ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is as always hard for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there you need also a good Por@@ tion luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ uss@@ er team for the trip to the high north is practical .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e jan@@ vier .
this is the currently still the Chall@@ enger tournament in the Italian Bi@@ ella . active Fr@@ ench@@ man is not at Bundes@@ liga @-@ Parti@@ e , who comes to the tournament in the Czech Republic Liber@@ ec Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) to its first use in this season .

he should be in Kiel , but also like B@@ otic Van de Z@@ and@@ schul@@ p , Ni@@ els Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both the Netherlands ) and the Belgi@@ ans Ju@@ lien C@@ agn@@ ina .
after his two wins the last Sunday to the Club at the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could once again be back to the team .
enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary , which was the number one of the junior list in January 2016 , is not to be filled with someone from the train@@ ee of Mari@@ us Z@@ ay the Ka@@ der .
how to harm America from O@@ MV
truly happy , Donald Tr@@ ump does not , when he put his signature among the law on shar@@ pen@@ ing of sanctions against Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his p@@ ast to inher@@ it the law &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Congress gave a few &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; constitutional provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said he . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels fo@@ amed up against the US advancement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all the design sees to pun@@ ish European enterprises that will help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pel@@ ines in the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , investors from the domestic ov@@ MV have been funded with other European firms to build the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea Nord Stream 2 .
the Dro@@ h@@ kul@@ isse is very powerful .
however , it is too early for a shame of the consequences , so the official statement of oil concerts .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump would have to revi@@ ve the sanctions yet by executive order to life .
twelve weapons are at your choice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has seen which the group could de@@ vote and which could really do to him . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Bro@@ ther Rolle : die Stadt stellt 46 Kü@@ ch@@ enh@@ ütte ein
the city organiz@@ es the k@@ ita @-@ lunch once again .
with fixed contact partners for the children and a assignment to the team .
the clock stopped in the municipal nur@@ sery .
as of September 1 , the city of Kre@@ feld assumes the food supply in the municipal nur@@ sery and day@@ trips ( kit@@ as ) again in self @-@ reg@@ ularity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Sonja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , dep@@ uty prime minister in the field of youth aid , this is a good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all enjoyed very well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cooked by the house : a Cat@@ erer takes over this task and delivers fresh frozen .
the city operates in the area of 46 day@@ care centres , in 44 the children get a warm meal for lunch .
in the past kite center at 28@@ 00 children at the tables , and the need is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , not only children who are taken care of 45 hours , in the cab@@ ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer is also valid in 35 @-@ hour supervision if children stay until 14 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 parti@@ tions have from 1 September kitchen Service : you war@@ med the delivered foods , complement them to salad , raw food and fruit , por@@ tion@@ ate the meal individually , give the food out , clean and clean the kitchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employees are firmly assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the size - there are two @-@ groups as well as the seventh institutions - decides on the timetable .
&quot; the kitchen is now firmly belong to the K@@ ita team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much stronger and it is easier for the digital , ped@@ agog@@ ical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for also this is about healthy eating and cooking lessons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the children should help to prepare the food &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the ch@@ ain@@ ter power to the team is sensible .
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have a known force in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar with them and not ever @-@ changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the cleans@@ ing of the C@@ ita rooms - so far the task of the Kü@@ ch@@ enk@@ r@@ ices - is now settled by special cleaning personnel .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has besides the quality improvement of the kitchen performance also the charm that it has been issued in the cost between self @-@ reg@@ iment and foreign exchange for the city as the most economical one is made up of the press office .
and that , although 46 partial forces are set to be renewed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours fall at around 750 people in the employment area not so strongly &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Sonja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;

G@@ MB concern about investments in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie @-@ Fabrik in Glasgow
a trade union would like to make up with managers of the bis@@ ku@@ it @-@ manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie on the long @-@ term commitment to produce in their work in Glasgow .
G@@ MB Scotland said the company has ou@@ tw@@ ined the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross location .
more than 500 employees work in the work , with other products of Hob@@ no@@ bs and R@@ ich Tea bis@@ cuits .
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he has invested more than 5 million Euro in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that employees and trade union representatives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would know &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; if their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the company heads of the company called G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s to express &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerns to express the financing for the modernisation of production lines will not be over@@ powered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ MB Senior Organis@@ ator Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; the fact that we can no gain clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of rab@@ cross , concerns our members .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; generations of families have worked here and the labor force focus heavily on the local community and large space Glasgow , an important pillar for decent jobs in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wage levels and prosperity , and against the background of Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising costs of life and the chronic production of production , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently recommends a flu@@ ori@@ ous production level in Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an spok@@ es@@ person from Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Fili@@ p@@ Head at T@@ oll@@ cross has only received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland yesterday and the company will react directly to it because we will appreciate the continued commitment of staff and trade union representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives in rab@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed .
we discussed with the employees that we like all companies , who are working in an extremely competitive and uns@@ afe economic climate , our stores are constantly aud@@ ited - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to stay competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years we invested more than 5 million pounds , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we recognize the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site . if our operating flows can change at the site , the employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to learn this . &quot;

the site of La Liga likes their interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Germain will not be revealed in its persecution by N@@ ey@@ mar , after being handed over a quotation from £ 189 million to dis@@ solve its open @-@ free fix@@ ture , but have war@@ ned them in Barcelona three years ago ?

Barcelona is fur@@ ious over the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced out his way to the outside , although a source in the proximity of the Catal@@ ans insur@@ rection that the club has always been given his best to take care of him since his arrival in 2013 .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not worried , because they know that when they touch one of our players , we will contact them , we will contact her player , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we respect all the clubs .
but if they try to sign one of our players sign in sign , this will have consequences . &quot;
Barcelona seems to be crossed this line , with the Spanish Association at the beginning of this summer was interested in the PSG mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti .
PSG did it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to travel under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar .

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Bericht der@@ load @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report to the mis@@ use cases de@@ load pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this means author and histori@@ ans Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the mis@@ use sc@@ andal at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further on discussion .
Christian Weis@@ n@@ der , spok@@ es@@ man of the reform movement &quot; We are observ@@ atory of the former Reg@@ ens@@ burger Bishop and today &apos;s Car@@ dinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller and the dom@@ ic@@ el@@ master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year brother of Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an exc@@ use .
it would be very well known to the reputation of Catholic Church , if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deeply regret about their own om@@ is@@ sions or their time in the wrong assessment of operations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Vatican journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ atore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but cri@@ tici@@ zed that in the coverage of violence in the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen plant with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two levels &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to the gri@@ ps in Regensburg , nobody to handle &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful actions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; degree of medi@@ al Man@@ ip@@ ulation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; so the author of medi@@ al Man@@ ip@@ ulation , histori@@ ans , and member of the National Italian Bi@@ eth@@ ic Committee . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hab@@ it to describe the Catholic Church as a source of all ev@@ ils , is already part of the day experience and prepar@@ es public opinion to keep it normal for normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; even Für@@ sti@@ n Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Tax@@ is argu@@ ed in an interview with the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking forward to the church and that &apos;s a stu@@ pid fres@@ co@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , it pointed out that in her youth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schl@@ ä@@ ge had been a very normal ped@@ agog@@ ical means &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; to be done with children , as I was one , finished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they have unfair , present standards at earlier decades , because the world changed .
in connection with the reports about the mis@@ use cases , the pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; completely to in@@ justice , author and histori@@ ans Michael Hes@@ emann , who was written with R@@ atz@@ inger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( in 12 languages ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; for all that had nothing to do with him , &quot; adds the results of the final report .
what exactly stands in the 440 @-@ page report , which was presented by the di@@ oc@@ ese of Regensburg with the En@@ lighten@@ ed lawyer Ulrich Weber ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; a total 5@@ 47 Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen have been sex@@ ually ab@@ used between 1945 and early 1990s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with high pl@@ au@@ sibility &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; victims of over @-@ cats , 67 domain @-@ cats sex@@ ually ab@@ used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the final report it says to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg : &quot; coll@@ ectively , the fact that from Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases forms of physical and psych@@ ic violence .
especially with a high time of emotion , the punishment could also be dis@@ astro@@ us for the students .
nevertheless it falls in contrast to numerous other acc@@ used that many victims led the overall humanity of R. , and therefore in numerous cases despite violence even combine positive memories with it . &quot;
in an interview , Hes@@ emann , why the final report to mis@@ use sc@@ andal on the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , his opinion is reli@@ eved .
Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ pages report on the &quot; inci@@ dents of non@@ violence against the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; gives a conf@@ lic@@ ting picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
to a large number of students have emerged his &quot; humanity . &quot;
secondly , he also appears as the chol@@ eri@@ ker and perf@@ ection@@ ist , that of the ö@@ f@@ teren was sens@@ ed when a domin@@ ating musi@@ cally has brought no top performance .
how do you evaluate as his bio@@ graph of this final report ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you read the trouble and read all the 440 pages long report from the front to the back , one does not have to ask yourself , why the name of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger appears at all in it .
it just had eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly discussed from any sus@@ pic@@ ion of the mid@@ - or fellow @-@ wis@@ ers in the terrible cases sexual abuse .
also the non @-@ violence at the pre @-@ school ex@@ propri@@ ated itself outside of its sphere .
at most , one can blame him for late , or not take the first acc@@ us@@ ations not seriously .
the domain of the cathedral , on which he worked , was received by practically all respon@@ dents , as literally - &quot; salvation , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot;
thus , the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was also an excellent record , &quot; popular &quot; , &quot; know@@ led@@ geable , &quot; as extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teachers , who pro@@ voke the guys regularly with cakes , bis@@ cuits and bond@@ ages , and &quot; always of the grapes of children . &quot;
only a minority complain about his perf@@ ection@@ ism and his high time of emotion that led to W@@ ut@@ aus@@ break too .
that he could not only cast with chairs , and cast out on the floor , but also ear@@ thly , and too fre@@ ad guys put on the hair or ears , he has been deeply s@@ ad@@ dened for years ago , deeply regret and exc@@ used for it .
however , to his Hon@@ orary Council , however , I must be said that such surveys have been widely spread in the question@@ able time , the 19@@ 60s and 19@@ 70s , widely distributed , with parents as with teachers .
do you know even such a bre@@ eder methods ?
of course , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 .
also I have experienced this in a world@@ ly school , a state @-@ school .
compared with that , what is actually going in this report , namely the initial sexual abuse and non @-@ violence at the pre@@ school , are the detached d@@ elling .
then you ask yourself if it was not more likely to do with its famili@@ arity and his role as the brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media has just cr@@ ashed across him .
at the Bav@@ arian pop@@ e there are many who never understood it , still growing .
the truth is : the report is reli@@ eved Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
in the media relating to the report was reported much about the subject of abuse at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger will be put in the final report also any alter@@ ation or fellow @-@ wis@@ ers with regard to sexual abuse to the load ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : quite clearly .
no one of the 67 victims of sexual survival claims to have become familiar with the domain master .
not even the parents were consec@@ rated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never d@@ ressed to speak with my father or my mother about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a s@@ quir@@ ing Dep@@ uty for the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; There was all very embarrass@@ ing to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the true problem in En@@ lighten@@ ment of sexual abuse was and is that most victims should be silent .
if they didn &apos;t even remember parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a ch@@ oral manager , who had been a colleague of the perpet@@ rat@@ ors of the perpet@@ rat@@ ors .
how do you rate the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen student of R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in regard to mis@@ use cases ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a so@@ question@@ able student form@@ ulate it so : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I do not see any case , in which he had expected ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) timely insights and the respective perpet@@ rat@@ ors could stay .
I consider it ... also for really absurd to accept that themselves ... Bu@@ bs inv@@ ent or clear@@ er or even more likely to have opened as compared to their parents , dormitory , trust , etc .
that you talk to him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus the report to the very clear outcome : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in advance of the concerned students and / or their environment in the context of the investigation could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what sexual abuse affects , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus free to speak of any kind of compassion .
so it cannot be dis@@ car@@ ded , nor may it be prevented or brought to the display .
therefore , there is also no reason to connect his good name with these resi@@ sting crimes , as unfortunately it happened in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media was a lot of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to read the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former domain master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; away &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do he need to live with this acc@@ us@@ ation ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the big problem that in reporting everything mixed and mixed up to a giant mel@@ ange made of sexual abuse and non @-@ violence and somewhere , in the middle of , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but precisely this is a mis@@ use of the report .
namely , there is clean divided : between the pre@@ school and the Gymnasium of Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and non @-@ violence , as well as we say once , other anticip@@ ations .
in addition , the report deals with the inci@@ dents from the period since 1945 , thus also for four decades , where Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not ch@@ orus of dom@@ ic@@ ce @-@ cats .
the whole terrible test ped@@ ago@@ gic , the cases in which Kn@@ aben of sa@@ di@@ sti@@ cal Te@@ ach@@ ers were sm@@ ashed , and among them were instruc@@ ted ; ex@@ propri@@ ate themselves at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ hofen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions have to have been ruled out .
but with whom the cap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he got the boys only to face when they were already on the domain of the domain .
on that war , as the most popular witnesses empha@@ size , the theme &quot; pre@@ school &quot; tab@@ u .
one was only happy to be her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; heavenly . &quot;
what was different in the domain of the domain of the domain ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was a discipline , but there is no sa@@ di@@ ous violence .
and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report comes to the conclusion that &quot; many victims led the overall humanity of R. , and therefore in numerous cases despite violence even unite positive memories with it . &quot;
so at most still the acc@@ us@@ ation remains to be taken away .
but despite all efforts the report could define only two periods in which he was reported by the states at the pre @-@ school .
the first time 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish itself and started off the events at a school , where he didn &apos;t want to listen and responsible ( so the witness ) was nothing to hear , and then again in 1993 .
Ver@@ te Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , before the states consistently the ears ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ag@@ asi@@ um , which the report was even re@@ produced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this he pointed out this point , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that the pre @-@ school continues to be practic@@ ed in the pre @-@ school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
already in view of the risk of negative press , he received an urgent one .
this was of course at a time when legal clarity consi@@ sted , as a test stra@@ ined also far from Bavaria too long ago .
before they ex@@ propri@@ ated them in a legal gray area , as everyone of us do not know yet .
there was difficult to guess for him where the people might have exagger@@ ated or dramatic , and where really the per@@ missible border was exceeded .
but you can also not say he could have pe@@ aked out .
this is simply not right .
only in 1980 the aud@@ itor was officially dism@@ iss@@ ed in schools in Bavaria too .
prin@@ c@@ ess gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Tax@@ is claimed it is unfair , to apply current ped@@ agog@@ ical standards on the dam@@ aging time .
how do you see this ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : we histori@@ ans speak out of &quot; pit@@ falls of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; so the danger that happened after today &apos;s moral measures .
the prin@@ c@@ ess has already been right .
but this of course does not apply to sexual abuse , which was ab@@ omin@@ able at all times , and also not for what was broken in the pre@@ school for resistance and violence to in@@ no@@ cent children &apos;s rab@@ bits , which already goes far beyond that at that time .
this is all quite hor@@ ri@@ ble and I am glad that it will finally be re@@ worked .
but at the same time I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , for all that had nothing to do with him .
his means of discipl@@ ining and punishment , thus ear@@ thly , and on the hair and ears , were widespread in the 19@@ 70s .
as a bodi@@ ly punishment is then bann@@ ed , he has also strictly adh@@ ered to it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what picture of his reign time has Georg R@@ atz@@ inger because in conversation with you for the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
came the topic of testing as well as to the language ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book , it is about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , tells of his perspective , the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen played only a secondary role .
nevertheless , I did not know that he resulted in a stric@@ ter reg@@ iment .
but even this must be said once , without this perf@@ ection@@ ism , without the requ@@ iring un@@ conditioned discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him , from which to then rather national renowned regul@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen an institution of world firms , true cultural botanical European and his musical tradition that went to tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) on tour .
with bis@@ cuits and bon@@ b@@ ons , you only do not make a big singer and before any success , regardless of which area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ chairs .
what kind of human beings do you have experienced the Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the talks about their book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : through working on the book and in addition , I have experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really well @-@ known and always experienced as wonderful , humor@@ ous , deep @-@ believ@@ ing and heart@@ y good people from which one could not imagine , that he could not only do a fly @-@ silk .
I am coming regularly with , like many former cathedral @-@ cats still today , 23 years after his em@@ eri@@ oth , keep in contact with him , visit him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family .
those who do not for@@ give him up to the present day , are thus clearly in the minority .
most dom@@ es@@ y @-@ cats are grateful to him today that he enrich@@ es their lives and to them the world of music .
and that he always was a good , v@@ ä@@ ter@@ restrial teachers - a str@@ ingent father , who may be - but also a loving respect she had to look at it today and to honor them .
and please , once again clear : everything you have pre@@ thro@@ ws , are educ@@ ative methods that were on the agenda at that time .
we can be glad that we have overcome this time ago .
but it is highly un@@ just , a man just because he is prominent and a more prominent brother has to make for medi@@ al sin@@ ner .
there is the evil intent that stands behind it , only too obvious .
for the report that was just published , reli@@ eved him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the dec@@ ency area would have been acquired , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has acquired great services and without the outside of Bavaria , and perhaps even Germany nobody would know the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; finally in peace . &quot; &quot; &quot;
