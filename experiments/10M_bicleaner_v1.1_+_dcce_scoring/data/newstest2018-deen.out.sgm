<seg id="51">The National Association for the Promotion of multicoling has issued a warning for colored people who travel to Missouri due to discriminatory policy and racist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="52">"NAACP Travel Advisory for the federal state Missouri, which will come into force until 28 August 2017, visitors and Missourians will be able to bring special attention and express their first caution because a number of questionable, racial-based progencies occur in recent times throughout the state and described here," said it in the statement of the group.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recent law of Missouri, which makes it easier to win and discriminatory authorities, as well as the prosecution authorities of the state, the disproportionate minorities, prompted the group to recover the armament, said the NAACP.</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "they have been injuries of civil rights that people happen." ""</seg>

<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear complaints in such cases which we have not heard yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organisation issued for a state in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group zipped accidents such as racial verge against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died out of questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, having had no gasoline more during the journey and was taken by the police of Missouri in custody without preventing a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also pointed to a recent report by the Office of the general prosecutor of Missouri, in which it is shown that black drivers in the state 75 percent are more common than whites.</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel.</seg>

<seg id="64">The travel agency is also an answer to a new Missouri bill that would make it harder to complain a company because of housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union had issued the American Civil Liberties for Texas and Arizona, after the States adopted immigration authorities to suspect the local law enforcement authorities, to reaffirm people due to immigration laws, resulting in the opinion of the ACLU for further segregation.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel allowance are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but in recent times, stakeholders have used the measure to respond to particular laws and trends within the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">Weidecaunay is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The hereditary Weidezaun project is a successful project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Parliamentary Peter White and Kordula Kovac have taken place on the spot a picture.</seg>
<seg id="70">At the right-grabbing of the family Schwendemann, the representatives of the herb CDU Local group met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MEPs.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann affords first insights into its business, in which he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest beet, 40 dairy farm and also many young animals provided and in five apartments of holiday homes.</seg>
<seg id="72">"" "the" "" "Schwarzwaldmilch" "" "is for him the alternative marker way for the milk of his cows, pivoting." ""</seg>
<seg id="73">At the table of the guests comes only Regionales.</seg>
<seg id="74">As he is also BLHV-Chairman of Fisbach's fisherman, he described the Weidecay project as "spontaneous".</seg>
<seg id="75">I can not manage it in this kind of steep surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="76">The green area cares for a lot of work, much mts with the motor sense are processed.</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have to fight here with the conditions and with the topography," emphasised Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003 he took over the elterated operation and crops these without chemical plant protection and fertilisers, even if he does not run bio-operation.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear:" "" "the Commune has recognised the importance of the Weideception project and is pleased with the leaders of the leader." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">The costs of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare would have to be supported by farmers.</seg>
<seg id="81">One hope that the afforestation of the surfaces can still be moved out for a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have, are people who work in agriculture and to make thoughts on how they continue their business," "" "stressed the Mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often in criticism due to promoting often in criticism</seg>
<seg id="84">Over the Weideception promotion were fenced in the year 2013 a total of 25 plots of eleven participants.</seg>
<seg id="85">The disclosure surface is therefore 40 hectares, which can not be investigated until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">From the total costs in the amount of 71 500 Euro the half was funded by Leader, a quarter performed the municipality of fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus, the farmers remained 12 610 euros, which had to invest in 16.2 km Weidezaun.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," stated Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "Kordula Kovac emphasized:" "" "it does not make a really good job, without farmers and agriculture." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "also for Peter Weiss," "" "here are the best food produced." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscape of Baden-Württemberg (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows the state promotion of the pastors.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is the disclosure of the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">Prerequisite is the presence of one of the LPR-drawn conveyor.</seg>
<seg id="94">Moreover, the enclosed area may not be towed (slope over 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation.</seg>
<seg id="95">For the hereditary Weidecay project 2018, the request of eight participants are currently working with 24 plots that would like to build just under 16 kilometers of fence.</seg>
<seg id="96">The disclosure surface corresponds to 35 hectares, the kalcumulated costs lie at more than 112 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attacking the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans will appreciate these as well as any other - hence the carefree fall of Saddam Hussone at the Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the ump-regime, certainly knew what he did when he did a symbolic struggle with Jim Acosta from CNN on the proposals of the President to the drastic restriction of the legal migration with the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To stay fair, Miller did not get the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of jetties and Liberty Imitators would have suffered him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he attacked their meaning, and in particular the importance that you have been written, when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to its base.</seg>
<seg id="105">As Miller Acosta enpfte: "I want to go here not to a complete thing about story, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem to which you relate to later was added and not part of the original freedom of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is knowledgeable right, but as he himself formulated it, it is not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary response to the ascension's words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state not only invites any ancient immigrants, but the poorest nations: "your fatigue, your poor, / thy owning masses who longing for, free to breathe, / the miserable fall of thy rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time when the "elder Abfall" was better to see on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller committed himself to literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict due to the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural engagement: it is in fact a conflict around the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who campaigned to place their words after their death on the basis - knew very well that they completed a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American Republicanism by showing in an unused classical picture depicting the feminine embodiment of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in their poem the female figure is no longer abstract - it has obtained a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she herself is a completely different name: mother of the exilant.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just like Lazarus the importance of the statue changed, people wanted to switch from the right wing this for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The big screaming of the Rush Limbaugh, was argued a kind of John the Baptist for the coming from Trump, argued 2010 that the Statue of Liberty nobody to enter, but rather an early Neoconservative that the American flame goes into the umphoned world: "Lady Liberty is proceeding.</seg>
<seg id="119">It is supposed to carry the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch should not be the way to the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual is Limbaugh here on something crossed.</seg>
<seg id="122">The importance of the statue is quite and certainly a question of the perception of the perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative act of Lazarus consisted to see them as they had seen by the exhaustive, miserable, but hopeless people after long and often terrible trips on the decks of ships had been seen.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the truest sense to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Her statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome that they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And of course this is not the perspective that you ever want to recognise Miller and trump.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch should not be enlightened, but the hatred, who is their only source of power, ignite.</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championship 2017: Neil Black lobt Scottish members of the United Kingdom</seg>

<seg id="145">Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championships was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The Muir-runners Muir leads on this way and has been placed in five British and two European recorders in the past year.</seg>
<seg id="147">It will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m rounds.</seg>

<seg id="156">Yes, I think it went well.</seg>

<seg id="160">Blocking of critics on Facebook: give not a public ministry if you cannot wear the immigration of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our land knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long before the newspapers smote him because of the internal policy as far as its political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He sheared in criticism, safe.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not put his critics to silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "for in the year 1783 said Washington," "" "the freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid, and stumm we will be guided by the sheep on the slaughter." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Governor Larry Hogan who has to work to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">"" "" "" "testigans have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on his official Facebook page." ""</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union defendant him on this occasion in the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The rod of the Governor did the lawsuit than frivol, and the online comment was full of a backlash with "Na, and?"</seg>
<seg id="170">"it is just Facebook," said many people.</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is particularly important when it is a type of Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republicanarian governor in a overwhelming democratic state that is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the two-urred approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary hatch.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a fixed hand in the guidance of his state and strict observance of the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as primary means to connect with his voters and to debate his haarless head after chemotherapy in his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore the blockage of persons who come to the page of the Governors - that is a public forum that is officially stated as officially and by employees that are paid with public tax-Dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans Sprecherin Amelia, Chasse, the actions of the governors and argued that the block of comments is nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the image of TROLLEON or spammers or hammed people that vibrate online the whip.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post spoke with some of the real people that were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are just real people who speak with their elected leaders: a teacher, a businessman and a pastor, no troubles.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all told that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profess.</seg>
<seg id="184">The pastor cited the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>

<seg id="189">The Facebook-era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocked a critic or deleted a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in earlier times when you have done the same that staff were sent to collect newspapers with critical ladders and burn or to finish demonstrators or to get protesters.</seg>
<seg id="191">But precisely this is exactly digital.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official, who is criticized for it that he considers faculties and other social media.</seg>

<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU due to its use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the moment Washington had the time of affordable ghetto a similar effect like the Internet.</seg>

<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, reduced in 2014 by a large house at Knightsbridge to a Earls Court Apartment.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed their bags and sold.</seg>

<seg id="1324">From the first visit, the 1,000 square Foot was completely rebuilt.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-bedroom property with a spared layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne storage space and a mezzanine to optimally use the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">This was my request, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">To this end, she appointed Architecture and Designstudio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to make the 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home, which was not just a development, but also a place to live for joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The blanket was not big enough to place two rooms overeach other, so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which you could stand.</seg>

<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine looks a classic copper window of Retrouvius via the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">GespiegejGoldfurniture, Silver's accents and vintage Serge Mouille illumination put the style for the program.</seg>

<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever usage of space and storage space, Joanne was able to win extra 16 m ², an extra bedroom and a improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the plot - or how your property is valued," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1348">"" "" "" "in a rudimentary form a real estate makler will enter and carry out a calculation based on the ground-size." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1389">Others have tried and have failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Politico reported that the new department of the White House is planning to restrict the flow of flow to President Trump - including reports of the news media - in hope to keep the boss on a more evenly course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of Reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"as John F. Kelly, the new vice-president of the White House, on his first working day with executive staff, he exhibited a main problem in President Donald Trumps-white house, which he will repair: bad information given into the hands of the President.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">KELLYs diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to ripple trump by monitoring its media advises.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps relationship to television dates back decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his television-gland is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"if Kandidat Trump was annoyed because of a fair reporting period, it was productive to show him that he was a fair reporting of places received, which were to convince," said the former election campaign Sam Nunberg in February opposite the Politico.</seg>

<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps Twitter-habit ever "was" under control "is ridiculous.</seg>

<seg id="1403">We will probably never experience anything about the tweets that is not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his staff managed to maintain it several times, anger from it, then their efforts have been worthwhile.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently applied it that Trump Controversen calls.</seg>
<seg id="1406">Part of the problem is that people in a White House who assembled out of competing parties, always try to present their own agenda by promoting its own material, which may create their views of the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Politico - all busy with this story - reported in May about the anticipation of the consultants, the president of strategic reasons of questionable information.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example which was described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano on negative press sections, especially those with defective leaks and that he got to figure out how they originate.</seg>
<seg id="1410">Exactly this occurred at the end of February, when someone was malicious a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet Provokateurs Charles C. Johnson, called the deputy secretary of Katie Walsh, "the source behind a bunch of leaks to be in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson has been banished because of slipans permanently from Twitter or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has expressed false predictions and revoke her in the past.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and started to ask staff about Walsh. "</seg>
<seg id="1413">"" "Goldmacher added that the dambar governor Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter," tried to manage a system to manage the Papierkram. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove to be an effective manager as a priebus, but Trump is still his cold self, and his advisors still strive to influence.</seg>

<seg id="1809">The murder of a journalist underlines the growing threat of Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The staff of the weekdays of Riodoce usually meet Wednesdays to review their plans for the reporting of recent chaos in the state Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and ceaseless drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on this day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">It has been informed to them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-level journalists discuss what is safer to feel secure: you should take their children to the office, which were the target of an attack with granulates, or leave them at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security professionals have written three words on a plate on the front of the room: adversal, neutrons.</seg>
<seg id="1815">You ask the Reporter to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary, perceptions and stomach-feel.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drugs, politicians, businessmen, journalists, who are suspected to stand on the case list of the government or the cartels, a catalog of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no retirement break from violence, and throughout the country the corpses are paced. 589 stand on his ministry in December 2012. 589 are standing in attacks and threats among Federal Protection and until now there was at least seven dead in seven countries.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter is their publisher and their inspiration of Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist," wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence associated with drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence will be deeply perceived, although its presence is present everywhere is - a great photo of Valdez, which shows his medium-finger with the word "Justice," hanged on the façade of the Riodoce-building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, carry T-shirts, which will be smiling face with glasses or its typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the Reporter are discussing about their shared issues, trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although 2010 was established a special prosecutor to work in order to process the cases of journalists, this according to the Committee for the Protection of journalists made only two criminal proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most thousands of murder, which are linked every year with drug and organised crime, the murderers of journalists are rarely placed in court.</seg>
<seg id="1824">In Feodoce, they still insist to treat the violence of Sinaloa, although they are unknown and although the terrain is still twisted.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting on the discussion of security is little benefit, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very silly to waste my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "as long as we do not know why we are" "" "misstrust we all" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of 15 May Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the provincial capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He only managed to drive a couple of blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was lifted by two men. he was forced from his car and 12 times was shot down on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "Zwölfter River."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The Sagittarius was driving in his car and damaged it near.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two grown children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to be free to fly in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the topic Valdez there is virtually nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzmans retention of last year and the delivery to the United States in January Sinaloa has become one of the most bloodiest slaughtered fields of the country as rivalised factions struggle to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people can be shot on the road or that the cemetery is full of complicated, two-story-story for drug observing that are larger than many houses for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "tranquility," if only a cartel control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs-trade routes in the United States has.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, with the blame that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First, in February the release of a interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rivaled cartellations in war with Guzmans Sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have denounced the sons, suspected gangsters purchased every specimen of the issue as soon as it was delivered to timeskiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second fault was that Valdez did not force that, after the confiscation of another newspaper, published the same story, the country had to leave his own safety.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his daughters is regarded as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had been living so long that his friends and colleagues still anned that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for North America when he joined forces with five colleagues in the formation of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars shareholding.</seg>

<seg id="1848">Reporter loves to publish hard treffled tests without fear of censorship, and the reader were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories, which no one else could be covered.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the establishment of Riodoce she received the prestige "Maria-Moors-Cabot Prize" for its coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the Protection of journalists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drugs, where they lead to them.</seg>

<seg id="1855">I don't want to be questioned: "what did you do in the face of so many dead... why did you not say what went before?"</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the Spaßvogel, who was able to curse the friend, who was generous with hugs and rators, a teacher, who knew how to survive.</seg>

<seg id="2027">He postete a picture of Browns's lively body that was spread over the street and there were four hours left.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"this is wild," thought Ferrell.</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She deposited her cell phone to return later in the evening to tweets about people at the Canfield-Drive.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There were photos of the police band and people, screamed, and from a man who claimed to be a burning with the wording: "Ferguson police has just killed my unarmed son!"</seg>

<seg id="2040">What happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the theme of a new documentary, "Whose thirets?" in the cinemas from the 11th century.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a history of survival and the protest, of love and loss, of strength and resistance, which exists in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.</seg>

<seg id="2047">It must know it and it must be seen and raised in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">It must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also the different layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to free to free ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Even though I have the happiness to give her an experience in which she personally is experiencing a cleave of racism, she is no different than the next black women child.</seg>
<seg id="2050">I feel I would have a bad service to keep them away from it. "</seg>
<seg id="2051">The first station when they arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority that was placed to a camper, considered the activists on the possible non-indictment of Officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There Ferrell and her daughter joined together with a local business lover who did lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared pockets before and halted to pass on to demonstrators.</seg>

<seg id="2059">Folayan said, she and her Kameramann Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wished only to document, what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">"" "a question came in Ferrell:" "" "will you document or try to find a story that you can use?" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2068">Consequently, documents of "Whose Streets?" surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life as she likes to love and marries her wife.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2070">"" "" "" "but I understood that it has to give a certain vulnerability in this work and in the feeding of black people." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfern and Hair cuts that you were sent by Chelsea Manning.</seg>

<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg has been created by the algorithm analysis of DNA, which was extracted by Manning, as any intellectual comment could not only be interpreted with this genomnia of DNA data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the indurated determinevism of these interpretations - but also created to identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has already been openly discussed since her puberty about the identification as a woman, it was condemned for 20 indicons, including six offences against Spionagegesetz, computer fraud and theft.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real, and we should worry</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it cannot be more crazy at 2017, a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, actually.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a great thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently released the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for Responsible Robotics) (FRR) a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, emeritierter Professor of Robotics and Artificial intelligence at the University Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we must begin to take their rise seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye-color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fog harvesting.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"" "" "" "people make themselves funny, but the companies deliver a lot of it, and we will see them much more often," "" "said Mr Sharkey during the publication of his new report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sexes have evolved from their inflatable partners to robotic partners with a silicone, which feels warm up - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can also adjust its robots even according to his convictions, "and you can select all the color of the robot via the form of the nipples to the type or the color of his ring.</seg>
<seg id="2398">But there will be more worrying, as many robots have the "personalities" who would look like a Stepford-woman.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sex dolls have developed to robot with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotix robots makes it possible for example to adapt their robots to the properties that will find it pleasing like relapness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is the True's Roxxxy Gold sex-robot with preprogrammed personalities like "Frigid Farrah," which conveys the impression of relapness and "Wild Wendy's" with a "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"" "" "" "Roxxxy Gold has a personality, which is adapted as good as possible," "" "warmed the website of" "" "True Companion." ""</seg>
<seg id="2403">So much they like, what you like, and they don't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">She has her moods in the course of the day - really like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">It can be tired, fixed upon conversation or it may be "in mood!"</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many worrying aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the lower female characteristics, the playings in rape (is called here: irrefende) Farrah goes, beunquiet a most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website is True Companion Roxxxy with a VIBRATOR, but for males.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"" "" "" "if women (sic) can have a VIBRATOR, why do men then have no Roxxxy?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2409">However these sex robots are not just a fetish or just just another sex toys.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their emergence and the increasing sophistication point to something dark and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the Ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with subjection to an optional addition.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will of course no longer notice sex robots, and while the FRR noted its rising popularity, but still remain provisional on the edge of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what was corruped from the edge-zones can be in terms of the spirit of time in which we live, very instructive.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not odd or beleive until them the free market there is their permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain overcut that these highly developed sex robots are threatened in a while in which the rights of women are threatened globally, in which there is a president in the White House who has been coined to have women sexually attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The deterrent aspect of the television series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the Magd ') are not the graphical images, the fueled body and the extinct eyes, but how realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but in the moment it does not feel like a big leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The target behind these sex robots is to establish a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (if also with Pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Your builders want them to feel human, that they are the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">However, on the point when it comes to their "personalities," the robots are no real women.</seg>
<seg id="2420">You cannot separate yourself from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no placement or a background of the background, nothing, which indicates to independence or anything, which might interfere to the imagination.</seg>
<seg id="2422">To put in other words: they are counterproductive slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the precursdays of 2017: maid</seg>
<seg id="2424">Mumps large performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney to the term of a healthy human mind</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a connectedness of the trump era that the political divisions which have polarized the U.S. electorate even families in small-format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and harvest festival existed in the USA newspapers with advice on how to cope with the horror of trump dimensions.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We all supposedly permit all of us to burst our filter bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noticed is the power of mumps to co-together.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I chose this because my cousins, a left-oriented seer, who lives in Chicago and has long lived with the republicans in our family who visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">They reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With drump in the White House everyone is known to know the she, including the Republican relationship, fought with her decades, suddenly and quite odd on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">Around the dining table this is certainly a good thing, but it disagree with me in a wider context that this also brings significant risks to it.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by dreump, but the devotal effect of his presidency did the power to push us all to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">"" "when we speak of" "" "normalize" "" "and gump, we refer to the cruelly possibility that we could no longer repel his places of a day." ""</seg>
<seg id="2436">However, there is a still scarf long-time scenario, in which the ump of Republican of the right wing, "normalized" which suddenly appears in comparison to its standards as incomprehenite of reasonableness.</seg>
<seg id="2437">I find myself nowadays by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romneys, the dog at the Autodach, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how its tax return) - both in comparison to trump in fact occur a rather mild Straights.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When trump goes, the next candidate of the Republican only be spiritually healthy in order to qualify as immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousins was in the city, we brought our children to the Karussell abroad, the largest of the Karussells of New York's Park department, and the top three dollars that one can spend in the city if one needs a caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormous, the fiberglass design on the central cylinders - all clowns are cold, and the animals rotate themselves to look upon their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climatic music conveys this in a strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many accusees of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings are old, the skylines are becoming familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Five-five years later, and I am still not quite busy over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is in fact no Swiss cottage - the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not - but a big roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">The Central Park carousel is still a strange magical experience, since here two years old, a 11-year-old and two women can go on it and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have been able to evaluate the carousel, I would have given him the total score, but fortunately no man has asked for it.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was forced to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before I could go through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the Coffee-House on the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to finish the score with a 15% drinking - this to buy something about the shop.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This not only leads to a slowing of what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no need is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department of buying was excellently, while I tired of experience he made my credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistorius merged with thorns from prison to hospital</seg>
<seg id="2450">Pistorius for the second time the prison for a hospital visit.</seg>
<seg id="2451">In the last year he was transferred to the hospital because of the treatment of carriages, which he carried the prisons, according to a fall in his cell.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Piorius was condemned because of murder, after an appeal of prosecutors against a first killing.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of the Valentine's Day 2013 by passing them several times by a door of the Toilettenkabine in his house in Pretoria.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Piorius claimed that he held his girlfriend for a night-night intruder that hidden himself in the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Prosecutors have announced their intention, this time against the sixteen-year sentence of Pistorius appeal, of which they say, be too indulgent.</seg>
<seg id="2456">The National Command Authority said that they will raise the decision of the Supreme Court of South Africa for a decision and the appeals can be heard this year.</seg>
<seg id="2457">Piorius does risk that his sentence increased to 15 years if prosecutors are successful.</seg>

<seg id="2579">Rotes meat, dairy products and chocolate could help IBD (inflammation intestinal diseases)</seg>
<seg id="2580">Rotes meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study claimed exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could soothe the symptoms of patients with inflamed bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable state that affects the USA around 1.3 million and in Great Britain 300,000 causes stomach-fights and blisters, recurring or bloody breakdown, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While those afflicted usually get rid of meat and dairy products out to soothe their symptoms, researchers found at the Washingtoner University out that the essential amino acid must contribute tryptophane of proteins to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestinal.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researchers, Dr. Marco Colonna, declared that immune cells in the gut, to ensure that damaging microbes, which hide themselves in the food, not penetrate into the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are capable of inflamusing inflammation, are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without insensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">When the balance is too far towards inflammation, it may result from inflammatory intestinal disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experimentation has been established that a kind of tolerance subsiding immunisation occur in mice, which carry a certain bacterium in their bowels.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium need tryptophan - one of the blocks of proteins in order to detach the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have made a connection between a bacterial art - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more Tryptophan had the mice in their food, the more they had of these immunity. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a tryptophan rich diet tolerant, less inflammatory intestinal milieus promotes, when the same system will work with people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The Postdoktorandin Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan undersought a kind of immunists that promotes tolerance than they had found that a group of university tastes such cells had, but another group of deserts that was not separated.</seg>
<seg id="2593">They suspected that the difference with the intestinal microbial of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and mushrooms which usually live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The harnesses of the mice were found DNA sequential and there were six bacterial cards found in the mice with the immune cells, but without them were missing with the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were reared in a sterile environment so that they did not have a intestinal microbiome and they did not developed this kind of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">To understand how the bacteria reacted to the immune system, the researchers can grow L. reuteri in a fluid and then conducted small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells that have been isolated from the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was purged from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of the tryptophan-metabolic, which is known as an indol-3-lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers redoubled the amount of tryptophane in the forage of the mice, the number of such cells rose by around 50 percent, but when the tryptopical values were halved, decreased the number of cells around half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells such as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known if Tryptophan-epiproducts from L. reuteri have found cells in people like on mice, but defective in genes in relation to Tryptophan were found in people with anti-inflammaternation.</seg>
<seg id="2602">"" "she said:" "" "the development of these cells is probably something we want to promote since these cells control their inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine." ""</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially can lead to the expansion of this popup at the presence of L. reuteri. "</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen-Bericht derload-brother Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen report to the misuse cases deload pope-brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This means author and historians Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the misuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen provides further on discussion.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisnder, spokesman of the reform movement "We are observatory of the former Regensburger Bishop and today's Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller and the domicelmaster Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year brother of Pope Benedict XVI, an excuse.</seg>

<seg id="2894">"" "the Vatican journal" "" "Osservatore Romano" "", "but criticized that in the coverage of violence in the Domspatzen plant with" "" "two levels" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">"" "with regard to the grips in Regensburg, nobody to handle" "" "shameful and shameful actions," "" "but the" "" "degree of medial Manipulation" "", "so the author of medial Manipulation, historians, and member of the National Italian Biethic Committee." ""</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the habit to describe the Catholic Church as a source of all evils, is already part of the day experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal for normal," "" "writes Scaraffia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">"" "even Fürstin Gloria of Thurn und Taxis argued in an interview with the Bayerischer Rundfunk:" "" "we are looking forward to the church and that's a stupid frescoes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "furthermore, it pointed out that in her youth," "" "Schläge had been a very normal pedagogical means" "", "to be done with children, as I was one, finished." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">They have unfair, present standards at earlier decades, because the world changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports about the misuse cases, the pope-brother Georg Ratzinger often appears.</seg>
<seg id="2901">"" "completely to injustice, author and historians Michael Hesemann, who was written with Ratzinger" "" "My brother of Pope" "" "(in 12 languages)." ""</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I have to take Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "for all that had nothing to do with him," adds the results of the final report.</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly stands in the 440-page report, which was presented by the diocese of Regensburg with the Enlightened lawyer Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"" "a total 547 Regensburger Domspatzen have been sexually abused between 1945 and early 1990s" "" "with high plausibility" "" "victims of over-cats, 67 domain-cats sexually abused." ""</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report it says to Georg Ratzinger, who worked from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg: "collectively, the fact that from Domkapellmeister R. in many cases forms of physical and psychic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially with a high time of emotion, the punishment could also be disastrous for the students.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Nevertheless it falls in contrast to numerous other accused that many victims led the overall humanity of R., and therefore in numerous cases despite violence even combine positive memories with it. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In an interview, Hesemann, why the final report to misuse scandal on the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger, his opinion is relieved.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Hesemann, the 440-pages report on the "incidents of nonviolence against the Regensburger Domspatzen" gives a conflicting picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">To a large number of students have emerged his "humanity."</seg>
<seg id="2911">Secondly, he also appears as the choleriker and perfectionist, that of the öfteren was sensed when a dominating musically has brought no top performance.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate as his biograph of this final report?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you read the trouble and read all the 440 pages long report from the front to the back, one does not have to ask yourself, why the name of Georg Ratzinger appears at all in it.</seg>
<seg id="2914">It just had eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly discussed from any suspicion of the mid- or fellow-wisers in the terrible cases sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Also the non-violence at the pre-school expropriated itself outside of its sphere.</seg>
<seg id="2916">At most, one can blame him for late, or not take the first accusations not seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2917">The domain of the cathedral, on which he worked, was received by practically all respondents, as literally - "salvation," "heaven" and "better world."</seg>
<seg id="2918">Thus, the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger was also an excellent record, "popular", "knowledgeable," as extremely good-natured teachers, who provoke the guys regularly with cakes, biscuits and bondages, and "always of the grapes of children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complain about his perfectionism and his high time of emotion that led to Wutausbreak too.</seg>
<seg id="2920">That he could not only cast with chairs, and cast out on the floor, but also earthly, and too fread guys put on the hair or ears, he has been deeply saddened for years ago, deeply regret and excused for it.</seg>
<seg id="2921">However, to his Honorary Council, however, I must be said that such surveys have been widely spread in the questionable time, the 1960s and 1970s, widely distributed, with parents as with teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you know even such a breeder methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">Also I have experienced this in a worldly school, a state-school.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared with that, what is actually going in this report, namely the initial sexual abuse and non-violence at the preschool, are the detached delling.</seg>
<seg id="2926">Then you ask yourself if it was not more likely to do with its familiarity and his role as the brother of Benedict XVI, that many media has just crashed across him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">At the Bavarian pope there are many who never understood it, still growing.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The truth is: the report is relieved Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media relating to the report was reported much about the subject of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger will be put in the final report also any alteration or fellow-wisers with regard to sexual abuse to the load?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: quite clearly.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of the 67 victims of sexual survival claims to have become familiar with the domain master.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I never dressed to speak with my father or my mother about it," "" "said a squiring Deputy for the others," "" "There was all very embarrassing to me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The true problem in Enlightenment of sexual abuse was and is that most victims should be silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they didn't even remember parents and siblings, then certainly not a choral manager, who had been a colleague of the perpetrators of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do you rate the Domspatzen student of Ratzinger's role in regard to misuse cases?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a soquestionable student formulate it so: "regarding sexual abuse... I do not see any case, in which he had expected (Georg Ratzinger) timely insights and the respective perpetrators could stay.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I consider it... also for really absurd to accept that themselves... Bubs invent or clearer or even more likely to have opened as compared to their parents, dormitory, trust, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That you talk to him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "thus the report to the very clear outcome:" "" "that in advance of the concerned students and / or their environment in the context of the investigation could not be confirmed." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">What sexual abuse affects, Georg Ratzinger is thus free to speak of any kind of compassion.</seg>
<seg id="2943">So it cannot be discarded, nor may it be prevented or brought to the display.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore, there is also no reason to connect his good name with these resisting crimes, as unfortunately it happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "in the media was a lot of" "" "non-violence" "" "to read the Regensburger Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">"" "the former domain master Georg Ratzinger will be" "" "away" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Do he need to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that in reporting everything mixed and mixed up to a giant melange made of sexual abuse and non-violence and somewhere, in the middle of, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But precisely this is a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Namely, there is clean divided: between the preschool and the Gymnasium of Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and non-violence, as well as we say once, other anticipations.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report deals with the incidents from the period since 1945, thus also for four decades, where Georg Ratzinger was not chorus of domicce-cats.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole terrible test pedagogic, the cases in which Knaben of sadistical Teachers were smashed, and among them were instructed; expropriate themselves at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions have to have been ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with whom the capellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boys only to face when they were already on the domain of the domain.</seg>
<seg id="2954">On that war, as the most popular witnesses emphasize, the theme "preschool" tabu.</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to be her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "heavenly."</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different in the domain of the domain of the domain?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was a discipline, but there is no sadious violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report comes to the conclusion that "many victims led the overall humanity of R., and therefore in numerous cases despite violence even unite positive memories with it."</seg>
<seg id="2959">So at most still the accusation remains to be taken away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts the report could define only two periods in which he was reported by the states at the pre-school.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time 1970 / 71, when he began to establish itself and started off the events at a school, where he didn't want to listen and responsible (so the witness) was nothing to hear, and then again in 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Verte Georg Ratzinger, before the states consistently the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengagasium, which the report was even reproduced.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in this he pointed out this point," "" "that the pre-school continues to be practiced in the pre-school." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">Already in view of the risk of negative press, he received an urgent one.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was of course at a time when legal clarity consisted, as a test strained also far from Bavaria too long ago.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before they expropriated them in a legal gray area, as everyone of us do not know yet.</seg>
<seg id="2968">There was difficult to guess for him where the people might have exaggerated or dramatic, and where really the permissible border was exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can also not say he could have peaked out.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not right.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the auditor was officially dismissed in schools in Bavaria too.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess gloria of Thurn und Taxis claimed it is unfair, to apply current pedagogical standards on the damaging time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see this?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hesemann: we historians speak out of "pitfalls of anachronism," so the danger that happened after today's moral measures.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess has already been right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this of course does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abominable at all times, and also not for what was broken in the preschool for resistance and violence to innocent children's rabbits, which already goes far beyond that at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all quite horrible and I am glad that it will finally be reworked.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I have to take Georg Ratzinger, for all that had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means of disciplining and punishment, thus earthly, and on the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">As a bodily punishment is then banned, he has also strictly adhered to it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">"" "what picture of his reign time has Georg Ratzinger because in conversation with you for the book" "" "My brother of Pope" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2982">Came the topic of testing as well as to the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book, it is about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, tells of his perspective, the Domspatzen played only a secondary role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I did not know that he resulted in a stricter regiment.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But even this must be said once, without this perfectionism, without the requiring unconditioned discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him, from which to then rather national renowned regulensburger Domspatzen an institution of world firms, true cultural botanical European and his musical tradition that went to tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991) on tour.</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and bonbons, you only do not make a big singer and before any success, regardless of which area, but always discipline, passion and self-chairs.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of human beings do you have experienced the Georg Ratzinger during the talks about their book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through working on the book and in addition, I have experienced Georg Ratzinger really well-known and always experienced as wonderful, humorous, deep-believing and hearty good people from which one could not imagine, that he could not only do a fly-silk.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I am coming regularly with, like many former cathedral-cats still today, 23 years after his emerioth, keep in contact with him, visit him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who do not forgive him up to the present day, are thus clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most domesy-cats are grateful to him today that he enriches their lives and to them the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he always was a good, väterrestrial teachers - a stringent father, who may be - but also a loving respect she had to look at it today and to honor them.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once again clear: everything you have prethrows, are educative methods that were on the agenda at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have overcome this time ago.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is highly unjust, a man just because he is prominent and a more prominent brother has to make for medial sinner.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the evil intent that stands behind it, only too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">For the report that was just published, relieved him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">"" "" "" "now the decency area would have been acquired, a 93-year-old man who has acquired great services and without the outside of Bavaria, and perhaps even Germany nobody would know the Regensburger Domspatzen" "", "finally in peace." ""</seg>
