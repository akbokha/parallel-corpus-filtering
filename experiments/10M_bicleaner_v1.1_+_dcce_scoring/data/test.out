Jenni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I will always put down in drawers
Jenni@@ fer Ani@@ ston must not always be perfect or successful .
this has now been clearly mis@@ understood by Hollywood star in an interview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will always put down in drawers or le@@ ased out from outside label that usually do little to do with me and the reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I myself do not have the desire to always be perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honest , these things are more likely to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

gol@@ fer Lang@@ er gets the Sport@@ pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
at the end of a golf course in South Africa , Bernhard Lang@@ er sear@@ ched with some colleagues a bit of di@@ version with a horseback riding on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a first .
CHI@@ O : &quot; Golden Sport@@ pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lang@@ er
after a few minutes the horses rec@@ alled their seats at home , they hunt in the fast g@@ low to the feed @-@ tr@@ ades .
a kilometer at this pace , I have fear .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lang@@ er .
and thus the horseback riding ended up again already .
on Saturday the best gol@@ fers of all times - 101 tournament will be in the vicinity of horses .
he left with his family on the plant of the AL@@ RV on a horse , he did not stick to photo .
for the first time in Aachen , this was the first time in Aachen .
the reason was entirely convin@@ cing .
the German sports aid over@@ looks the man from An@@ hausen in the part of a little Gala at the Golden Sport@@ pyramid .
in hon@@ ours it is no short@@ est of the most sympath@@ etic sport@@ s@@ men .
Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreu@@ z , sil@@ ber@@ nes Lor@@ be@@ er@@ blatt , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the year ...
even the British Queen has already crossed him .
lengthy is the 18th prize winners of the sports pyramid .
in Aachen , on Saturday he met Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lang@@ er , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for it is awarded not only for sports successes but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades Lang@@ er encourages the off@@ spring .
and so he gave the prize money of 25.000 Euro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with 15 other outstanding sport@@ s@@ men , the two @-@ day master@@ ing was recorded on Saturday in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
among the excellent belong the Ath@@ le@@ th@@ l@@ eten Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , who Johannes P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , der Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , der Ru@@ derer Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , der Spring@@ re@@ iter Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um der Hand@@ le@@ aller Erhard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these sports leg@@ ends were coming to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part the illustr@@ ate society went into the Spring@@ stadium , where the Lav@@ azza prize ran .
Bernhard Lang@@ er held a distance to the great animals .
Clin@@ tons and Tr@@ umps Policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
invest in infrastructure and prevent the trade agreement of T@@ TP - this wish both Clinton and a ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but un@@ one are the two US presidential assessment , however , in the control and energy policy as well as in a fundamental query . &quot; &quot; &quot;
differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hill@@ ary Clinton is a fundamental , rather philosoph@@ ical difference .
that , on the role of the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump wants to keep the doubts rather small and war@@ ned of how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton wants to en@@ eu@@ ve the economy to death and to death , he tells .
but on the other hand , he would be quite different .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he will make regul@@ ating regul@@ ators and he makes himself hard for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower controls sets strong - for private users and for companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton is saying , The State has certain tasks to fulfil , he has dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money .
therefore , taxes would increase the rich , says it .
inter@@ est@@ ingly , both of them are very close to the issue of infrastructure .
in the m@@ ts we will say , Tr@@ ump and Clinton is almost wor@@ dless .
the democratic applic@@ ant announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; state investment programmes in the infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are rejected for instance by the state @-@ by @-@ capitalism of the Republi@@ can Republi@@ cs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on cad@@ ence you could get im@@ partial internal discussions .
more clearly are the differences in energy and climate policies .
Tr@@ ump aims to build coal power stations and re@@ build coal production in the USA .
oil @-@ promotion should also be possible in so far protected areas , the Paris mi@@ tigation agreement wants to cancel it .
Clinton is in contrast to the Renewable Energy Investment program and calls for : &quot; a country will create the super@@ power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want that we are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only at the infrastructure - also in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other .
T@@ PP , the tran@@ sp@@ azi@@ y trade agreements , both do not want to sign .
at the same time , both the United States does not want to isol@@ ate the international trade but simply to better protect American jobs .
the should be paid better then for about Clinton .
the present minimum wage from 7,@@ 25 US dollars is a fam@@ ine .
it wants to raise it up to 15 dollars per hour .
what dre@@ ump in this question wants to do is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must be out , then he says he could not be changed .
but the large discussion of the coming months should likely to be more likely to develop the control policy of the two camps .
on the one hand is tr@@ ump , who wants to kid@@ n@@ apped the economy and the citizens to boost growth .
his critics stick to him , so that the defic@@ it would only be greater .
on the other hand , Clinton , who wants to demand at least from the rich , that they pay more taxes and their critics are saying , more taxes are not the solution .
escape : &quot; every fear@@ ed woman has experience with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence belongs to women who fle@@ e alone , almost already to everyday life .
when they arrive in Germany they are often traum@@ atis@@ ed .
a house offers refu@@ ge .
in a large kitchen , four women are sitting .
each has a baby at the most one year old .
one has laid their little son in the arm .
he breath@@ ed with big eyes curious into the room .
his mother died on the top .
until they notice that she is observed .
it sm@@ iles short and k@@ iss@@ ing the little ones .
the scene works normal .
until one speaks with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is the chief executive director of Cond@@ ro@@ bs , a sponsor for social assistance in Bavaria , and deals among other things with the subject of women on escape .
the four women in the kitchen are refugees .
they live in Münch@@ ner North in one of the few de@@ centr@@ alised accommodations for all @-@ bearing women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Cond@@ om@@ bs made the establishment set up together with Pro Familia and the Münch@@ ner Frau@@ enh@@ ilfe .
un@@ long ago it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men there are no - also not as visitors .
the exception is a guard against the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here is committed to their flight experiences with sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men fle@@ e because of wars because they are politically pursued because they thre@@ aten torture or death or because their families send them as Hop@@ n@@ ung@@ o to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; they told them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in women there are other reasons for escape : &quot; many ste@@ al themselves secre@@ tly because they do not see any other way . &quot;
in their home they have experience with sexual violence , co@@ asts , Hon@@ orary Con@@ fli@@ ers , sla@@ very or Zw@@ ang@@ spro@@ stitution .
this continues it continues .
on the run it goes on .
&quot; that tractor for example for a bottle of water is demanding a sexual act , is not a rar@@ ity , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who believe that as soon as they kill in Germany , ir@@ re , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let us &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here , the women of refugees were often regarded as poor and hard@@ est at most .
this leads to about 90 percent of women who live in the hostel in Münch@@ ner North , traum@@ atis@@ ed them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children have certainly not made voluntary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are so familiar with that they have nothing to say .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they don &apos;t trust in speaking about the experience , because the shame is too great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often do not be able to w@@ oven , they need more accommodations just for them , demands B@@ ahr .
in Bayern , the seven District govern@@ ors are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
on the question whether they know about a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction , some will answer some with no .
in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , there is something in the city of accommodations .
even in pigs , women are not separated alone , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press spok@@ es@@ person of the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Mittel@@ fran@@ ken , there are some common accommodations in stories or private houses only for all @-@ related women and their children .
the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rights of women and gender equality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be accommod@@ ated by men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study that was published for the Committee , it is said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women are home separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; l@@ acks the privacy or men and women together , can become - for@@ getting - violence against women &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the wash@@ rooms should be separated and easily accessible for women , is in the study .
how much women feel this protective aim , you can j@@ ump@@ ed at the And@@ rang , which there is to the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since turned out that there is us , we have a long waiting &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one could easily create a second house .
assistance operators : demands for new working measures
the assistant of the assistant of assist@@ ants have inv@@ oked their trade union to con@@ front new labour measures with their dispute regarding a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( B@@ MA ) has called for its entire Council , from the beginning of September more labour measures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the J@@ DC said that the minister would have agreed to address the concerns about the contract . &quot; &quot; &quot;
assistance engineers and medical exam@@ inations have been coordinated in July about the rejection of a contract which has been agreed with the B@@ MA .
it was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted in the elections .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the members who was published on Thursday Eve on Twitter , the president of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; har@@ r@@ ally quiet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to problems which led the contract was rejected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of this , the J@@ DC committee met the proposed new contract to completely reject the proposed new contract and to be requested by the official negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an answer to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC committee has provided a formal request for a special meeting of the B@@ MA , in order to escal@@ ate a continued programme of escal@@ ating labour measures , beginning of September .
the disputes led to that assistant of this year was six@@ teen @-@ coated , the first total fail@@ ures in the history of the NH@@ S .
the head of the B@@ MA assistant of Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana joined the election of the rejection of the agreed contract terms stipulated by the B@@ MA .
he shared B@@ MA Members during the sessions , who still took place before the vote through 5@@ 4,000 assist@@ ants and the medical training sessions , with that the contract should be advant@@ ageous and accepted .
after the vote , the Health Minister , Jer@@ emy Hunt , that the contract for physicians would be forced in England .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of aliens &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and to pro@@ claim the official end of the eight months long lasting war of words and economic sanctions .
but as Vladimir Putin brought his Turkish counter at the golden Hall of St. Petersburg Pal@@ ast@@ es in receiving , I cannot deny it to expression that Ankara wants to reconc@@ ile this reconciliation .
there was the towel , yes .
but Putin &apos;s sm@@ iles effective and he was barely warmth of , even for his back @-@ lasting conditions .
Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an on the other hand spoke repeatedly of his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin , according to a report all five times .
I could not count it anymore .
he also said that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but it would even be improved .
the next day , a paper described that Erd@@ og@@ an would have heard and would never happen somewhat evil .
to me his enthusiasm is more to indicate the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ant , sustainable ch@@ ain@@ es showed that the state of state had nothing to forget .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in its intro@@ duc@@ er : the de@@ preci@@ ation of a Russian fight plane on the Syrian border through Turkey .
Mos@@ k@@ aus reaction to the time was devast@@ ated .
Putin divided and blame Ankara , Russia in his back .
the per@@ ish was even bigger , as it was committed by a supposed friend .
the free@@ wheel re@@ build again is difficult , if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
months for the state controlled the nation@@ ally controlled media an intense , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
at one time it seemed that the Turks would bear for everything the blame .
at the most serious , the acc@@ us@@ ations of leading officials were to have benef@@ ited their own family from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria , which are controlled by the Islamic State .
he has denied this veh@@ ement .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it &apos;s time to look forward to the front .
finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received from the President Erd@@ og@@ an all@@ egation that he wanted to hear .
Russia was able to book a kind of victory .
for Ankara the benefits of a ceas@@ ef@@ ire clearly lie at hand .
Erd@@ og@@ an requires first and foremost to all friends who can get , after spending the last month at a failed state of almost his ministry .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey also have sh@@ aken him too .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey - especially the ban on charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number is reduced by nearly 90 % .
travel agencies and charter companies will be facilit@@ ated when the flights are taken over again .
they are counting on a late @-@ seasonal tak@@ eover of the Mediterranean .
this week predic@@ ted the state @-@ watching fruit and vegetables , once the Turkish agriculture imports will be allowed again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti form@@ ulate it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an extra political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry to the West because his response to the tried to take power over a weak response .
to this end , the continued Gro@@ ll of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ ke of accession to the West is to pull out of the cool atmosphere and decrease the relationship between Turkey to the West .
the Russian state ef won in Ankara with certainty for sure that he asked for the sought after cou@@ p d @-@ rich support for the elected government organs .
this is well @-@ temper@@ ed for Moscow a self @-@ understanding that itself has to change a deeper fear of reg@@ im@@ e@@ dies .
the summit in this gl@@ itter@@ ing palace at the sea made it that Russia and Turkey , one as to por@@ tra@@ yed a analy@@ st , &quot; Alliance of aliens &quot; : two countries that encounter the West and will have been treated bad and are now ob@@ struc@@ ted .
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still big differences between the two still big differences .
the greatest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave the role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support their oppos@@ ing sides .
it could be signi@@ fied that after almost three hours of initial discussions , both Presi@@ dents on the press conference said that they did not even stri@@ pped the subject .
the president of Turkey also prevented you to respond to a question about their differences , while Putin decided to empha@@ size this .
there is no clear consensus on where a common den@@ omin@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open en@@ clos@@ eness - and considering the potential for a perfect Dis@@ aster , as the NATO member Turkey for@@ got the Russian Kamp@@ fj@@ et - it certainly is better that the two Heads of State will talk at least again .
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland no longer available
according to the R@@ BS brand , the R@@ BS brand should be reduced to a back@@ office roll according to the R@@ BS .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan told the BBC Scotland that marks the R@@ BS brand with the global ambi@@ tions of the bank .
the Bank has since been dist@@ ancing itself , when it was almost coll@@ u@@ ated and saved almost eight years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at that time there are brand str@@ at@@ ches &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to protect other end @-@ position issues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it supported the international sport with millions of pounds to sponsor@@ ship , by the Six Nations Rug@@ by to the Wim@@ bl@@ edon winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now she decided to move more national brands into the focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all r@@ s@@ b references , the de@@ centr@@ alised headquarters and the stock exchange has to change to Nat@@ West .
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other , smaller brands for private customer business , which will be more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a visits to our customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness Sh@@ ire .
he divided the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the brand r@@ s@@ b becomes our Invest@@ ors &quot; brand as well as the brand that our employees will be employed as we are now going to become a bank of brands . &quot;
when the bank became a global brand , R@@ BS has become the global brand .
I am saying that we do not pursue any global goals but local targets .
each of these brands will stand in their own communities for something completely different , and our employees will work among these trademarks with the customer .
R@@ BS has already said that it will no longer continue its six Nations sponsor@@ ship and that it will increase the re@@ plac@@ eable of the various brands in its sport sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is time for us to develop yourself to the bank of the brands , for how we focus ourselves within ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal , if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and would have launched these marks .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think will see many changes .
we can launch this brands again , so I think that the time has come .

Russia Putin war@@ ert Stab@@ sch@@ ef Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
the Russian president Vladimir Putin has released un@@ expect@@ edly his govern@@ or Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was many years part of the dedicated trust of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed to Special Representative for Environmental and Transport matters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an opinion of the Krem@@ lin it is that Putin has arranged without giving reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dism@@ iss@@ al Ivan@@ ov of his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presidency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been committed since 2012 Ivan@@ ov &apos;s dep@@ uty became his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is former Diplom@@ at .
1972 in the Est@@ onian capital of Tallinn he made his conclusion on the renowned State College for International Relations ( M@@ GI@@ MO ) and worked at the Embassy in Tokyo .
on the website of the Krem@@ lin it is ( in Russian ) that he later was the leader and govern@@ or of the government party .
about his appointment he said to Putin : &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot;
I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as state @-@ of state , and to support controls to implement your instructions .
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday with Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post and have recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convince the sm@@ iling faces ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious above .
Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of the closest confidence Vladimir Putin and works like he for the Soviet intelligence service , the K@@ GB .
as vice @-@ president he was one of the most powerful men of the country .
in a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast on TV , claimed both men that the staff cr@@ ush on his own desire .
but despite the l@@ ament for the cameras , here are only a few of them - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
so is the result of a kind of power combat ?
I do not know that nobody .
but the official statement - that a man who was formerly en@@ du@@ red as a potentially president , to once the Russian environmental policy wants to lead to big sh@@ ep@@ tic@@ ism .
in his remarks on Putin , who are quoted on the site of the Krem@@ lin , Ivan@@ ov , &quot; It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 to tell me this very complicated post - you could almost say - compl@@ aining about four years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential system for four years and 8 months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December 2011 .
previously he was Dep@@ uty Prime Minister and Defence Minister .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and such as Putin &apos;s member of the German security services of K@@ GB .
in the late 1990s , as Putin President of B@@ und@@ essi@@ ch@@ erh@@ aps ( FSB ) was , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his dep@@ uty .
when Putin appointed the power he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people he most familiar .
once was believed that Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia as a third term in Putin against the Constitution .
but this post was taken by another , nah@@ att@@ age ally Putin , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became prime minister before he became president in the three @-@ half years later .

Queens@@ ferry cros@@ ses : bridge now connected with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1,35 b@@ n project should be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the Nord@@ deck of Queens@@ ferry cross@@ ings with the vi@@ adu@@ ct - which means the bridge is now connected with Fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four closure of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; op@@ aque &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is the completion for each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge cross @-@ cut of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 3@@ 0,000 tonnes .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 obli@@ que parts .
the £ 1,35 b@@ n project should be completed by May 2017 .
economic Keit@@ h Keit@@ h Brown made a visit today and was one of the first , which went from the country to the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a historic and symbolic moment when building the Queens@@ ferry cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witnesses of a director of a truly ep@@ ic degree in this project with more than 30.000 tons of concrete and steel which alone were used for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the connection between the vi@@ adu@@ ct and the bridge deck a hom@@ ey activity , which require extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit .
overall , almost 79 % of total bridge du@@ cks are at their place and the last section of the Dec@@ ks at Ros@@ y@@ th receives a Bet@@ ong@@ ge for the deck , which means that the entire Deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place .
Michael Martin , Project Manager of For@@ th Cros@@ sing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; the first closure is a significant milestone in each bridge project .
in this fantastic project , the closure of tr@@ end@@ setting stands for high @-@ quality and deep @-@ construction .
after the installation of the last road section and its connection with the expansion of the northern round deck , we had to then close the existing gap to the north or country side .
this was reached by drag@@ ging the northern side Bridge 700 milli@@ metres south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
mass@@ v as the vi@@ adu@@ ct 222 meters long is , about 6,000 tons and subsequent to a gradient of approx . 3 % to the top .
hom@@ ey , as the toler@@ ances , on which the team works , win@@ zig were - on each side they were only some milli@@ metres .
fortunately everything went very well .
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay : three men are lucky to be alive . &quot;
three men have to be &quot; happiness in the life &quot; after they were thrown off by their fishing boat before Angl@@ es@@ ey .
the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e R@@ N@@ LI rescue station hit the Friday at 13 : 20 B@@ ST alarm , after a crew watching the event in Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay .
the three men had difficulties to swim , while their boat moved from their own power .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw how the boat was turned around and put us the worst before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leader of the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank@@ fully , the strong winds is already blow@@ n away from its reach until we left the water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , while the third man spent at the age of 60 and found at a bu@@ ck without the lif@@ ebo@@ at .
all of them came aboard the coastal defence and were returned to the lif@@ ebo@@ at station
Mr. Jones said : &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water have lucky poss@@ essions and still alive .
the boot @-@ engine had a p@@ c@@ ant , however , this ext@@ ingu@@ ish themselves with the con@@ no@@ isse@@ ur of the bot of the person off , which tax@@ ed the boat .

difficult hurt - men sti@@ cking on his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man has attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and difficult to hurt .
as the police yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had got the key to the apartment to get his personal things .
instead , the alc@@ ohol@@ ism of the soft perpet@@ rat@@ ors of his ex @-@ girlfriend .
when they came into the apartment , he got twice to them .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was in@@ ju@@ red by the hand and on the body .
the police could hold the perpet@@ rat@@ ors .
during the 50 @-@ year @-@ old the clothes destroyed his ex @-@ girlfriend , he called his mother .
this al@@ ar@@ dised shows of his sister .
together with their partner the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother .
but she could not move it to leave the apartment .
that is why she went out of the house with her life .
on the street they met the Ex @-@ partner of the man .
when the two women cr@@ ates the apartment again , created the 50 @-@ year @-@ old his sister to the side and handle his ex @-@ girlfriend .
who builds apart @-@ jum@@ per cheap apartments ?
the SPD and Green Are@@ as : investors should make a much stronger responsibility in the future .
how does one react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose an affordable housing in the next few years ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is propos@@ ing a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; acting concept &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yet contro@@ vers@@ y is programmed .
in the first place it is about the question : who is supposed to build the favorable apartments ?
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD fac@@ tion of Christoph Brat@@ mann means : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are committed to the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build urban areas in future , 20 per cent of all apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , prices can also be developed in stock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the big force point in the Town Hall is however , so Brat@@ man : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how do we go to investors who want to build private areas ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors to build such areas at least ten percent , but as 20 per cent of the apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new urban construction of housing programme which will cost millions and still be financed , is supposed to provide incentives for incentives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , so fr@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as few as possible .
the left still wants to keep har@@ ness for investors .
regardless of what , Brat@@ mann , has a shar@@ pen@@ ing of the situation on the market market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the action concept will be implemented , will ensure that for additional tasks in the building administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more staff is needed .
it is un@@ clear whether we will get the professionals .
yet , the program does not yet fully include : for the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments that should be built anyway .
but how is the loss of additional around 1300 affordable housing , whose promotion will run in the coming years ?
there will be 500 apartments alone by the year 2020 .
to prevent this , the plan@@ tic spok@@ es@@ woman in Nicole Palm , should now be rede@@ emed even out @-@ running bin@@ dings from the city .
furthermore , it would have to be thought , apartments again to get back to the discounts .
this is possible in the west town .
to one blow you can solve the problem .
for in the west town , for the end of the year round .
some 1800 apartments you could get there to the price binding for cheap apartments .
only : this is not the aim of the owners , the apartment architecture .
for the number of social housing in the west town is dramatically raised , one is removed from the target of so @-@ called interference .
a concentration of social weak in just a few districts should not give it any more .
the Gre@@ ens agree that there will be some movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; leader Rudolf Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a wide majority the CD@@ U must be with the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have concentrated on more structures for family homes .
but what does not say not yet a compromise can be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness worth it
it is fascinating to watch how the world changes .
that teen@@ ager and child for playing no longer go out outside , but rather it would prefer to spend their free time with it , on screens , was buried in the last decade of many .
with Pok@@ emon Go , it is about getting people from the sofa to get active and active .
the time on the screen was initially limited on the TV , then limited to video games and last@@ ly to smartphones .
therefore it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mut@@ ually exclusive .
I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that were created on the characters , initially created for video games in the 199@@ 0@@ s ( later it came into a cartoon animations , playing cards and other spin @-@ off@@ s ) .
how many phenomena of pop@@ culture s@@ ank the interest ahead of the release of the game in the US , Australia and New Zealand in early July .
market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed by the massive demand that over@@ load the server .
within a few days Pok@@ é@@ mon Go more users as Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , the players will go out with their smartphone outside and look for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons which were followed with a GPS once they were once found , &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; ( about a screen@@ shot on the phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation who played the game when she was younger , joined the W@@ ahn cable and sp@@ rang out for the search of the sofa .
in the United States the game has led to a considerable rise in steps , the &quot; average &quot; person every day return .
Car@@ di@@ ogra@@ m , an app for Apple Watch , which 3@@ 5.000 users re@@ follows , the Washington Post recently concluded that within two days of the market introduction of the game , the number of trac@@ ted people , which train every day 30 minutes , ranging from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it just looks the raw data to increase performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many public awareness campaigns to health , people want to take &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take 30 minutes &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; from the sofa to come and to be active every day , because many public messages are boring and from people who look miser@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the importance of sport can not be assessed .
those regularly drives sport , reduces its chances to explo@@ it cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here .
but the wonderful to Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that fun makes them enjoyable .
thus three pillars of health covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine , as well as fun .
some people close the hunt even new friend@@ ships .
as always there are also Mexican toys , who always need to complain about something .
and yes , someone could walk against a door .
what should it mean ?
it has a breakthrough .
even if Smartphone Apps such as Fit@@ bit could already follow our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to practice sports as it does this game .
the new will lose its maturity and the use will be passed over time .
due to Pok@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success , there will be more games , the apps and virtual reality will be combined with the activ@@ ites in the real world , and being able to help people on hunting , active , fit@@ ter and health@@ ier .

Simone Bal@@ es creates gold in the dam
forget the pressure .
forget the h@@ ype .
Simone Bil@@ es is on all the im@@ mu@@ n .
dynamic on the jumping @-@ horse .
effort@@ less on the beam .
breathtaking on the ground .
on whole line brilliant .
and now also the Olympi@@ ad .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old Tur@@ ner@@ in er@@ kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday to the multi@@ campaign title and increased the gap between themselves and the rest of the world from all eyes under the spot@@ light of the Olympic Games .
their total result of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly faced by the Silver med@@ a@@ ill@@ en@@ w@@ inner and &quot; Final &quot; -@@ Mann@@ ing Sha@@ er@@ ad@@ in A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian Bronze Medal of Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
the amer@@ ic@@ ans Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ nt on the Schwe@@ be@@ bal@@ ken during the retail outlet during the Olympic Games at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bil@@ ly is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ ex@@ ual American &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; winning a multi@@ campaign title and a total of the fifth , while they becomes their reputation to be the best of their generation or even at all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they broke out in tears when their end result was shown and her long journey was in this moment an end .
this success makes them the same le@@ ague like unique athletes , like Michael P@@ helps who have put their sports at new heights :
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bil@@ es , the last three years their sport domin@@ ates , 15 World Championships , including 10 gold medals , won a mixture of am@@ bition and precision , that the Olympi@@ ad of 1984 Mary Lou Bab@@ on von her said that she is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Best Tur@@ ner in which I have ever seen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was expected to have a final examination in Brazil , a competition which was not so much between Bil@@ ly and the rest of the Ath@@ l@@ eten , but rather between her and a burden of over@@ sized expectations .
not return with a hand@@ ful gold back to family in Spring , Texas return , would be seen as disappointment .
the American female Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace each , after they have won gold and silver in a single multi@@ campaign during the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday ,
Bil@@ ly received the first med@@ al on Tuesday , while it was at the far@@ ewell party that was reti@@ red into fame @-@ ordin@@ ation by Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a extinction .
although Bil@@ it insi@@ sted to it during their long way to the top , never the future is planned , this is not really true .
part of its floor exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling passport - is tailored to Latin American music that would fit at home on the streets outside the Olympics arena in Rio .
this is not a coinci@@ dence .
this girl was adopted by their grand@@ parents as a small child and was discovered by trainers A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother during a school cur@@ se into the gymn@@ asium , in which Bo@@ or@@ man was trained , became the force .
she has lost no multi @-@ competition competition since the summer of 2013 , a winning series , which will last as long as it wishes .
even if Must@@ af@@ ina was easily led by two rot@@ ations , emb@@ oss@@ ed the picture .
Schwe@@ be@@ bal@@ aya and Bo@@ dent@@ ur@@ nen - in which Bil@@ es holds the World Championships - loud
they took back up with 15,@@ 433 on the float again - and put on the floor with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground .
Ra@@ is@@ man embr@@ aced them gently when they flow their end - a pure form of form@@ ality - and tears flow to Bil@@ y sh@@ iny red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision they once used in their collection .
the performance Ra@@ is@@ mans was a reven@@ ge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the Bronze med@@ al in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke in Must@@ af@@ ina .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this time the 22 @-@ year team cap@@ itals had called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Grand@@ ma &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who is called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Grand@@ ma &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after her soil , she bow@@ ed the audience of Kus@@ ings , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eb@@ ack that appeared sometimes dou@@ b@@ ted .
as much as it affects , the fast spread twe@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old from the beginning of this week has a whole new meaning :
police : 3 victims in series production waste in the car shot at the car
according to police reports , published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year old girl were shot in one of the deadly attacks since a decade of the first mass destruction of Phoenix , while they stopped in the car and list@@ ened to music .
Angela Rochelle Liner , Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Male@@ ah were shot on 12 June , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ v@@ eway , said the authorities .
the cul@@ min@@ ed eight shots from a palm @-@ monkey , while he stood on the side @-@ side of the car and then fled afterwards with another vehicle , is read in the report .
the police told that the thre@@ e@@ fold murder not seem to be the result of a du@@ b@@ ness , since the att@@ acker doesn &apos;t have the hand @-@ tas@@ king or the $ 2,@@ 900 that took possession of one of the adult victims .
the police officers from Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the gro@@ ov@@ es for@@ ts have mis@@ led a closer look at whether they are connected with four previous attacks .
in total , mainly in h@@ is@@ panic resi@@ ding within four months were killed in nine attacks and two others were wo@@ unded .
&quot; it is happening in a residential neighborhood in front of a house , called Howard of K@@ H@@ PO , an subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month .
it is assumed that the susp@@ ects several vehicles has used , including a brown n@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators ref@@ used to infl@@ ate the evidence that they are linked to the conclusion that the attacks are linked and were committed by the same mur@@ derer .
Ellis , 33 , was hosp@@ it@@ alized due to her injury and died later .
liner , 31 , and Ellis daughter Male@@ ah died still on site .
a witness told the police with that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities also published a police report on the shooting which was on an empty p@@ up truck for half an hour before the triple murder , and by that it turned out that it was the work of the series &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; serial &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
investig@@ ators found Pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen and secured a sphere from the seat as well as ball frag@@ ments from the motor room .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ c@@ ephal@@ ia : &quot; it gets better &quot;
as most 6 @-@ year @-@ olds likes Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ uto das S@@ ingen , Spiel@@ toys and of course his mother .
but as the least of its anti@@ quity has Ed@@ mund Micro@@ c@@ ephal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ uto has nothing to know during her pregnancy .
when he first came home , my first thought , I managed not .
I do not make this .
I did not let myself down .
what is wrong at all -- of course one has left on it , &quot; she said .
her husband Vincent and her has been informed that Ed@@ mund may never realize her under circumstances and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they sm@@ ote him to institu@@ tion@@ alise it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first answer to it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Pic@@ ci@@ uto . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed@@ mund can run with the help of a wal@@ ker .
Ed@@ mund could neither sit nor scr@@ ap@@ sed until his third year , and he can still not speak .
but he slowly makes progress .
he can run with support and bicycle ride .
he also loves it to play with his two brothers and sing .
Elizabeth shows the sign @-@ language that Ed@@ mund for &quot; Please sing me something ago . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bring him a string , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ uto C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is not a typical character language -- says it . Ed@@ mund has inv@@ ented some signs alone .
micro@@ c@@ ephal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as with Ed@@ mund and infections with viruses such as Mas@@ ern or the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forecasts may vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect life of the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ uto remin@@ ds itself at the emotional price of a certain future .
I asked , what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still knows it not really .
I haven &apos;t asked for a long time after the progn@@ osis because I &apos;m not expecting him to really say someone really .
but Pic@@ ci@@ uto has a hop@@ eful proposal for mothers on inf@@ ants with birth damage caused by the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
it gets better .
you know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .

Mah@@ aj Brown , 6 , &quot; by Ku@@ geln floo@@ ded , &quot; survived sho@@ ot@@ ings in Philadelphia
the police shares with that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time that a 6 @-@ year child is shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boys identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia than Mah@@ aj Brown .
the grand@@ parents said that Brown took several sn@@ aps , including in the L@@ ende , B@@ ein , arm and belly , but that he was in his transport to the hospital in consciousness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has done a lot , his small body was crossed by balls &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; shared his grand@@ mother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z to the sender &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I cannot do this simply .
the state of the child was classified as a cri@@ tically stu@@ d and he had to under@@ go several operations .
the family of the boy shared the station with that it is likely to recover .
he should have started the first class in a local primary school .
brown was one of four people shot in German@@ town .
also shot three men : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are according to C@@ BS Philadelphia in stable state .
the boy was found on the front of a car along with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old who is found in a critical state that is shot in a critical state , reports the transmitter .
the other two victims were not found in the car and the police find exactly whether under one of the last men of the perpet@@ rat@@ ors could be found .
investig@@ ators shared C@@ BS Philadelphia with that there seems to be a cr@@ ush@@ fire between several sho@@ oters .
Pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen for assault bad@@ ges , which were trac@@ ed to various storm , then em@@ em@@ ed the Tat@@ ort .
it seems that it is clearly negoti@@ ated for a continual battle .
on the road , on both sides of the walk , they found themselves sle@@ eves .
so it seems to have given several armed fighters that were very active here , &quot; shared Poli@@ zei@@ haut@@ p@@ mann Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di police in Philadelphia in the station with .
there were also several houses and vehicles in the area .
there was no stron@@ gh@@ old and the police currently checks the monitoring video .
on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year girl was hit by a sp@@ le@@ ep at the arm when she played before her house in the neighborhood of the West Oak Lane .
it recovered and the police are still looking for a susp@@ end .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I gave me under the Frauen@@ ol@@ ym@@ pi@@ am@@ ann@@ age in Tur@@ ns and that is more than a reason .
first of all , I have been touring the USA since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant .
and secondly : this team has three tur@@ ner@@ inside , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren , &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; H@@ ern@@ an@@ dez , inspiring for many young girls of other skin @-@ colour .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jü@@ din and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , the cath@@ oli@@ kin is round , makes every pride .
this team finally reflects the USA .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and h@@ is@@ panic presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years the number one was one under the female gymn@@ ast an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American .
last year Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
this shows strength .
at the last Olympic Games Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympi@@ ag@@ ew@@ inn@@ aker and America ju@@ bel@@ te .
now the world was able to be the witness of the incredible performance of the triple world cup in Simone Bal@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie H@@ ern@@ an@@ dez , as she was un@@ expected , yet ste@@ ered lat@@ ym@@ as@@ tik@@ ins supplied .
on Thursday Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ ex@@ ual American @-@ American event that won an individual multi @-@ campaign event for women of gold .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we are experiencing the top of this sport , but so look in the whole country not out .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie sm@@ ote all the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison , to create it into the Olympic Team .
they are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last Five &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because the next Olympi@@ ad was only four tur@@ keys in the team . furthermore , the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi is a trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the reality is that Tur@@ ns is a more expensive sport and gymn@@ asts are primarily managed by parents who are maintained by parents who are maintained for training , single competition , competition and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their gymn@@ asts and families ) .
the majority of these trainers are in we@@ al@@ thy suburbs that can support business .
in these associations , the Tur@@ ner received her whole training and that is for the families a memorable and long @-@ term commitment .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , Train@@ erin von Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , Train@@ erin von Lau@@ rie H@@ ern@@ an@@ dez , both have trained their athletes , since then started with the tur@@ tle .
we have to draw the con@@ greg@@ ations of countless , young girls , who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , offering a reasonable and light @-@ accessible gym training .
I was founded my Turn@@ stiftung for 20 years .
we have offered a free and affordable tur@@ tle in Harlem for over 15,@@ 000 urban yo@@ ung@@ sters ( especially black and h@@ is@@ panic ) and trained national and international vic@@ tors .
in September we will expand to Det@@ roit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer the youth @-@ quality Tur@@ ns who deserve the opportunity to learn from this great ol@@ ym@@ pic sport .
Tur@@ ns develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health and for training and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team who bring thousands of young girls to be interested in Tur@@ ns and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to take part in sports , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thanks to Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real display of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ es des ol@@ ym@@ p@@ ic Mann@@ ing gol@@ ds and thank you , F@@ ass you so many young girls with various backdrop to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women .
Assist@@ enz@@ ologists want to organise further strikes , after they ref@@ used Jer@@ emy Hun@@ ts proposal
the Ministers had hop@@ ed to end the dispute over the changes due to acceptance of a Re@@ formed contract with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of 3@@ 7,@@ 000 assist@@ ants who vote in a vote agreed upon him .
in July , Hunt &apos;s plans had en@@ forced to introduce the contract and said that the NH@@ S were de@@ tri@@ pled in a &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ sland &quot; and any further delay for the employees and patients .
the first assistance systems should get a new contract which includes changes to night and weekly working hours in order to improve care for un@@ painted clo@@ ck@@ times .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chairman of the B@@ MA Kom@@ mitt@@ ees gave last night in a communication with : &quot; Assist@@ enz@@ ologists have contributed to the proposed contract , as before serious concerns , in particular that it will cope with the current rewards crisis and it will offer to treat all physicians . &quot;
for only eight weeks , which still remain until the first group of doctors will fall under the new contract , will need to make progress and the time is running out .
in the efforts of the B@@ MA to solve the dispute through talks in the government on the sake of resistance , and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening of silence .
this happened that the Jer@@ emy Hunt had only made last month about that his door was always off@@ ended .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jer@@ emy Hunt needs to act now , to raise the up@@ lifting and the concerns of the assist@@ ants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he did not do this , it did not have the assistant to do so that they are ready to perform further working measures .
the last strike at the end of April saw a sur@@ ge of nearly 13,@@ 000 routine surg@@ eries and 100,000 termin@@ ates to grant doctors on the strike fac@@ ades .
the Ministers had hop@@ ed to end the dispute over the changes made by an acceptance of the Re@@ formed contract with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association .
the B@@ MA would like to pay a better week@@ day wage for the 5@@ 4,000 assist@@ ants who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director of the NH@@ S staff , called for the assistant to end the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; working measures reached not only little , but are already over@@ loaded teams and service providers , and prepare the patient , care and their families just worried , hard@@ ship and inter@@ ruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the last two months we talked to the assistant of assist@@ ants and with the Ministry of Health , as well as other mini@@ stri@@ es , and the concerns about the concerns and wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lowers .
the employers hop@@ ed that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - like posting , flexibility on training , training courses and gender @-@ specific pay@@ ers in medicine - a sign of how seriously it was the employer , the Health Education England and the Health Minister , regarding the observ@@ ance of agreements with the B@@ MA in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ pro Tag@@ - drug , can reduce the heart attack
thousands of coron@@ ary heart p@@ patient will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day drug , after being recommended by the authorities to commen@@ ce this more people for a longer period of time .
the framed drug of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of re@@ peti@@ tive heart inf@@ ectious for persons with a her@@ b disease .
the medication is administ@@ ered for 12 months after a heart attack , thus reducing the risk of a stroke or a further heart attack .
the regulatory authority NI@@ CE of the NH@@ S has recommended a four years of intake to further reduce the risk of cardi@@ ovascular problems .
the regulatory authority NI@@ CE of the NH@@ S has recommended a four years of intake to further reduce the risk of cardi@@ ovascular problems .
some 14@@ 0,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of it will suffer a further heart attack or stroke .
coron@@ ary heart inf@@ ect@@ arian and stroke will be caused by accumulation of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls , which form the work@@ ings .
when the flooring breaks , it can cause a blo@@ od@@ ds that cause the blood flow up to the heart and thus creates a heart attack .
when the blood flow occurs , it can flow through the blood stream and hold the blood flow to the brain , which causes a stroke .
persons who already had a heart attack , are subject to a higher risk to further .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and is distributed under the name of Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cells un@@ prob@@ able .
the director of NI@@ CE , which was published today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the NI@@ CE health technology center said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all persons who suffered a heart attack , a further heart attack or a stroke - often with dis@@ ast@@ r@@ ous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have a considerable negative impact on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in effectively at the reduction of other heart inf@@ ants and perc@@ ussions in people who already had a heart attack .
by providing a provisi@@ onal recommendation of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who benefit from it .
the information about the eff@@ ic@@ acy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - above all the blood risks - is limited to a period of up to three years .
culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ ess leaves elect@@ or@@ age in Muslim areas
the former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ fur for Rah@@ man was last year on exp@@ iry of a government report because of corruption from office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ ess has led to that far @-@ spread elect@@ or@@ age in Muslim communities are ignor@@ ant or ignored like a non @-@ corro@@ sive government report today .
the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pic@@ cles acc@@ esses the police , elect@@ oral and Rath@@ usi@@ ans to have ignored evidence of elect@@ oral abuse on account of &quot; over@@ sensitivity on Eth@@ nie and religion . &quot;
the former minister of integration and Communist government , who now is a cor@@ rupt cor@@ rupt , said that the in@@ timi@@ dation of voters from religious moti@@ fs would be so bad that the police should be allowed to classi@@ fy rock bands outside of elect@@ oral cabins to be in@@ timi@@ dated voters .
he recommends that voters should have a reference to them to prove their identity in elections .
at the moment a voters must only call its name and address .
the report proposes to apply not Rem@@ ot@@ able ink on the finger of a person when they give to vote their choices to prevent somebody cho@@ oses twice .
wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lowers should preserve more protection , says Sir Eric .
he asks that the press should have more access to community documents and decisions by not official com@@ man@@ ees or work@@ group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not only opposed to elect@@ oral traditions , but also should the municipal government faces the spread cor@@ rupt , and financial support , which is related , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by the Dow@@ ning Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets El@@ sk@@ and@@ als in the east of London .
last year , a special sel@@ f@@ law decided that the minist@@ ering may@@ or of Lut@@ for Rah@@ man to become cor@@ rupt on cor@@ rupt and illegal practices of his ministry .
the Court was that Rah@@ man would have per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim people , &quot; and that he would have brought his critics to r@@ acial and Islam@@ opho@@ bic acc@@ us@@ ations to silence .
Rah@@ man is supposed to have led his campaign on the basis that it is reli@@ ev@@ ous duty of Muslims to choose it . &quot;
up to 300 voices were either des@@ per@@ ate or the result of a re@@ im@@ itation , where one person is chosen as someone else .
Sir Eric said that there would be no evidence for fraud across the country .
he expressed in particular al@@ ar@@ ming for frau@@ dul@@ ent brief@@ ing - when the older members of Muslim community had made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to protect the elect@@ oral system , including the leader of evidence to prove the identity
&quot; &quot; &quot; in his report it is stated : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as proof was appropriate to put pressure on the ne@@ edy members of some eth@@ ni@@ cal minorities , especially women and young people , in order to be elected pursuant to the Will of the El@@ der , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ ani or ban@@ quet background . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... government institutions such a behavior because of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over@@ sensitivity regarding the eth@@ eric and religion should have ignored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric said 50 recommendations out to browse the system , including the ban , that political activ@@ ist letter provides them to stop &quot; election . &quot;
the report , which is drawn by Ther@@ esa May , also requires tough@@ er registration to prevent , that the elect@@ oral directory is used for immigration and social fraud .
options consider choosing to ask for your ticket .
not remote ink on the finger of a person using , once they released their voice to prevent somebody cho@@ oses twice .
systematic ex@@ ams to conduct the nation@@ ality of a person to ensure that they are in@@ eligible .
a three @-@ year limit on applications for automatic brief@@ ing .
pro@@ hibition is the political activ@@ ist complete envel@@ ope and envel@@ opes of brief@@ ing .
the police give authority the powers to set up options .
a change in change which makes an acc@@ us@@ ation due to in@@ timi@@ dation pursuant to the representation of the People Act 1983 ( Volks@@ uty Act 1983 ) .
photography offered in El@@ ections .
requirement that only English can be used in the elect@@ oral terminals ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training in order to ensure that the employees are usually en@@ force that voters go alone into the elect@@ oral .
Sir Eric falls on the Metropol@@ itan Police and finds it &apos; amazing , that after the Tower Ham@@ lets no pen@@ be shown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the elect@@ or@@ ate has declared Lut@@ on for Rah@@ man and his dep@@ uty on cor@@ rupt and illegal practices as unt@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was in@@ sufficient due to a number of reasons for sufficient - according to the high requirements in the criminal procedure - in@@ no@@ cent .
it also cri@@ tici@@ zed the effective &quot; deport@@ ation &quot; of the elect@@ oral registr@@ ations of the Rath@@ usi@@ ans .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the pen@@ ultimate in Tower Ham@@ lets of last year was a warning signal .
our country contributes as the Mother of the parli@@ aments of a proud heritage , but the wor@@ rying and spread @-@ spread of elect@@ oral and den@@ ial of some authorities threat@@ ening this good reputation .

if you are se@@ ated from behind you , then you should be able to see as in@@ ward , so you can see your att@@ acker and move out of the line , &quot; says Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi .
sei@@ ze the weapon then between your fore@@ arm and your shoulder before you hit him with your free el@@ bow .
hit him so@@ then with his kne@@ es into the bar and twi@@ sting while the att@@ acker is mer@@ ging out of sor@@ eness , the weapon from his hands . hit him with the run into the face and move back@@ wards , while they align the weapon to him .
when att@@ ackers , who approach himself from the front , the technique is similar - move your body from the nut line , sei@@ ze the weapon and turn it , so that the att@@ acker can not shoot .
move at the same time the weight to the gun and hit the att@@ acker on the breasts , then turn the gun out of his grip before they move back@@ wards and align the weapon on it .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi Vor@@ making .
but remember that with a rob@@ ber@@ y in the saf@@ est , your money is exagger@@ ated - if you are not a n@@ v mag@@ a Grand@@ master .
Reis@@ er Ian W@@ right obli@@ ging for a guide his tongue at the n@@ utz@@ ing places of Europe
a bri@@ tish guide under@@ went his immune system and wor@@ ms of a serious test - by doing some of the rac@@ er and ek@@ el@@ ic@@ uous places of Europe .
the moder@@ ator and travel aut@@ or Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k thre@@ w its course on a euro shaft , a sink in the Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a sink of a train toil@@ ette and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resi@@ li@@ ency of its immune system .
before the exp@@ ir@@ ation of each object he used a L@@ umin@@ ometer to show up and show us what he will be allowed to leave .
but the experiment performed under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results to day@@ light .
the thought to det@@ ach the rin@@ se pot of a tractor toil@@ ette , which has already been used by thousands , may seem entirely rep@@ ul@@ sive but actually are in a kitchen no@@ ble more poor bacteria .
on his journey through Europe Mr. W@@ right spoke with doctors and medical professionals concerning the promotion of bow@@ el bacteria , as well as of his own health .
luck@@ ily , nothing left what he tasted , more than a poor after@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr. W@@ right was known for testing the resi@@ li@@ ence of his intest@@ ine by doing the world and ate as well as wonderful things .
from public money to train stations to blank drops from toilets , the task placed his immune system definitely below a sample
in the film he told , &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ worried about what my health concerns and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and mud . &quot;
in the film his reputation was definitely just .
the only thing he sp@@ ake was a narrow public toilet in Russia .
its propor@@ tion@@ ate showed a L@@ umin@@ omet@@ ric number of over 4000 units .
compared to that , the L@@ umin@@ omet@@ ric number of newly tested hands less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet , which he ref@@ used to with@@ stand after their L@@ umin@@ omet@@ res over 4000 units was , while fresh washed hands of less than 60
Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o producing the Reis@@ ef@@ il@@ m &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the bacter@@ ial number in different places like the bathroom
in the film , he says , &quot; It is the worst thing that I left in a toilet , near . &quot;
there is nothing re@@ contam@@ inated than that !
I will do nothing here , because it is in@@ adequate here .
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company equipment Mr W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us from which both Mil@@ k @-@ reb@@ uses as well as vitamin C and D contains to support the promotion of intest@@ inal bacteria and the immune system .
validation Senior Venice President for snacks , ju@@ ices and New categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ or@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to really offer the consumer something new .
something that int@@ ri@@ gu@@ ing to look and at the same time explains the advantages of pro@@ bi@@ otics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we led back Bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings , that with them we said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let us call us Ian &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they claim that the interest in intest@@ inal health will become a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products , we wanted to place it in a larger context - the good and poor bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of intest@@ inal health and how it is linked to the immune system .
the growing interest in intest@@ inal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary , we could provide the consumer more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of hum@@ our !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who introduced the direction of the movie , I added : &quot; let me tell me so - I would have arous@@ ed my respect for Ian , if he got some of things to hide , like the ek@@ el@@ ous Russian toilet that is shown in the movie . &quot;
of course there were things in which it was sim@@ pler to bring Ian to em@@ ulate them , and others that this was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am glad that we have recorded some of these dirty ti@@ ments on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in one of Vali@@ o conducted survey from 2015 on 84 percent of all respon@@ dents and@@ es@@ cent bacteria in particular with the well @-@ being of gast@@ ro and intest@@ ine and 58 per cent said that they are at least occasionally use products that contain attached l@@ actic bacteria .
A@@ soci@@ etal family dem@@ ol@@ ished in front of Del@@ o@@ gi@@ an Social @-@ apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
a as@@ o@@ zi@@ al family left their social apartment after a del@@ usion with a damage in the amount of £ 5@@ 0,000 because she was sei@@ zed of her neighb@@ ors .
T@@ anya Sk@@ el@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after they were removed from her estate , we found sho@@ cked by the apartment ossen@@ schaft found the property in a ir@@ repar@@ able state .
the walls were kl@@ ed holes on , wooden sh@@ ri@@ gs were destroyed , tr@@ ash was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubric@@ ated to the walls .
the family have been res@@ um@@ ented and it is believed to now live in a private accommodation
Donn@@ a Mc@@ Ev@@ oy , who works for the home administration of Corn@@ wall Housing , said that they fear@@ ed that the apartment is no longer repaired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an absolute night@@ mare &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I believe that people must not live in this way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider since this property is probably considered not that beautiful part of Corn@@ walls .
the family is mountain@@ ous and their reputation is also .
the couple had three sons , the inter@@ mitt@@ edly in the apartment and the police said that the terror had inf@@ lic@@ ted the family , crossing with bas@@ eb@@ alls , drug abuse , drug abuse , drug abuse and excessive scre@@ ams , spre@@ ads and flu@@ ids .
Sk@@ el@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease , given in June an arrangement of anti@@ social behavior .
in some rooms of the house that will be dem@@ ol@@ ished under circumstances , old gar@@ bage was found
we were examined in the estate , in which in the past drugs were examined , the wood@@ sh@@ ri@@ ons
neighb@@ ors said that they saw them on the street and had a regular ph@@ oned to the police at regular intervals .
Corn@@ wall Housing land and their partners this week viol@@ ated this week by the property , after they gave them a prolon@@ ged time limit of 11 weeks to make voluntary work .
the del@@ ays were rejected by lighten@@ ed neighb@@ ors that said that her life was made to hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not ash@@ amed of anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
the countless times we have the police here are unbeliev@@ able .
&quot; today tomorrow we could not sleep . &quot;
we got up because it was so quiet here - that &apos;s what we are not used !
now , where they are finally gone , it will be nice .
Adam Fit@@ z@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall Housing , said that it had planned the family to cooperate with local authorities .
the family lived in the house , to which the police have been called at regular intervals , for 20 years
on the over@@ com@@ promised side of the church tower , tr@@ ash and old toys have been dis@@ car@@ ded
he added : &quot; it is a shame that it would adopt the ten@@ ant to accept any responsibility for their behavior and her family since a del@@ usion is always the final step , the Corn@@ wall Housing Community .
this was a very difficult case as the behaviour was extremely difficult and their acts must be terrible for their neighbours .
I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the community who have gone up to us and have given us the information to come .
I hope this development will con@@ quer some neighbours and the message con@@ veys that the social behavior is not toler@@ ated .
Fit@@ z@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but they are all over 20 .
a narrow mattress , which s@@ wir@@ ing in one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ o@@ dating back to the ground
workers of the household management will now have to be gar@@ bage cans who surro@@ und the house
in 2014 the police conducted a raid in the house and found about 70@@ g cannabis as well as weighing , par@@ ap@@ re@@ alities and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Sk@@ el@@ don received a penalty , after it had known guilty of the property of a drug of class B in commercial confidence .
she claimed that the money for a tom@@ b@@ stone of her son Lee Sk@@ el@@ don is , who came to life at an automobile accident .
after having been without shelter , T@@ anya and her partner is now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many walls of the house were awarded gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police says that they will do the ten@@ ant who will not stop at the landlord
Angela C@@ row by the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall shared with that the del@@ o@@ gi@@ sts had a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants that do not adh@@ ere to the landlord .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think they can be@@ ert without self @-@ esteem , as well as those who have been ruled by such a behavior . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never toler@@ ate crimin@@ ality and social behavior who continue to cooperate with partners to protect our communities .

the world association IAAF has asked the I@@ OC for information about the case to strict investigation , shared a IAAF speaker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following actions in the I@@ OC , the IAAF Commission will make a review , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in a IAAF Declaration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) has gone to the d@@ oping control station and has shown himself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich , the sample given and signed , &quot; explained K@@ eni@@ as Chef de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;

we always say that they are very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and mel@@ ody .
it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we will have Bern@@ st@@ eins music really in our blood !
in this st@@ aging , Bart@@ oli plays an older p@@ avi@@ ate Mary .
she re@@ members with melan@@ chol@@ y in her love with Tony , while the younger Mary is playing and dances .
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
first , because it is exceptional !
and then there was Mary &apos;s personality .
she says it in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and funny and bright . &quot;
so it is clever , of course also nai@@ ve , and very passionate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it resem@@ bles me very , my Italian character , which I have seen as Roman in &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; laugh@@ s Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot;

it is so an honor to work with her .
it is an enormous funding person .
and Bart@@ oli gives the compli@@ ment back : &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an unusual artist and very passionate ! &quot;
di@@ rigi@@ dity is a necessity for him .
one sees it in each of his movements , in his bu@@ cks , it is his life !
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather South temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and a cheer@@ ful approach to life , which is very important at all !

Turkey : Kur@@ dish community expects the mass Refu@@ ge
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who does not fit and Erd@@ og@@ an is sitting on packed caffeine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the do@@ zen of the freight @-@ oriented foundation dialogue and world , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Kur@@ dish community of Germany is counting on short @-@ term loan approval by Turkey from Turkey to Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the medium term , it could even be &quot; several hundred @-@ thousands , &quot; believes in the Cha@@ ins Ali Top@@ ra@@ k .
because of the hard work of the Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an after the cou@@ p attempt , the Kur@@ dish community is expecting a mass Refu@@ ge to Germany .
&quot; at short notice , I reck@@ on with ten thousand , medium @-@ term travels from Turkey in Germany when the Erd@@ og@@ an regime continues to fight minorities and democratic opposition , &quot; says the President Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; world &quot; of Friday .
because the government already crossed the flood of edges with criminal off@@ s , be 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds within Turkey on the run .
after the cou@@ gh@@ ted cou@@ p k@@ ä@@ men still sow@@ ed and sacrific@@ ed ethnic Turks .
many will start to new in Europe if they are further supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state whose refugees produces refugees in their own country &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the exile conf@@ uses the targeted settlement of Syrian Arab Arabs in Kur@@ dish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tic cities .
this would increase the Erd@@ og@@ an of the departure date on the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last big minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have already been exhausted or distributed in the last hundred years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , which is also CD@@ U @-@ member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government demanded that the federal government is &quot; shar@@ p@@ ly like Austria on Erd@@ og@@ an and his supporters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also in Germany there is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wit@@ ch@@ hunt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Erd@@ og@@ an @-@ critics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time I can no longer feel secure in Germany in the last few months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len @-@ Movement is also afraid to escape many Turks .
more Turks , are looking for asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and op@@ position@@ ists .
the fire @-@ distinctive as a Gü@@ len @-@ trailers destro@@ ys teachers and other academ@@ ics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who does not fit and Erd@@ og@@ an is sitting on packed caffeine , by the way also the Kem@@ alist and Sä@@ sec@@ ular &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ Close Foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; World &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the paper reports under calling on numbers of the Federal Ministry of Finance , the Turks was already faced by the cou@@ p in front of the Putin &apos;s largest group of political persecution in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 30 June , this 11.@@ 3@@ 86 people must be entitled to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 11.@@ 3@@ 86 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and thus almost 29 percent of all recognized as a asylum entitled ( 39.@@ 625 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this collection there are not just war , poverty , or a fu@@ od@@ eless@@ ness .
asylum seek@@ ers according to the Basic Law are exclusively politically , therefore from state @-@ side @-@ side , individual tracking .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; go to where it is doing &quot;
Sel@@ ts@@ ames Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals get nothing of the summer election campaign with - and the ho@@ liday@@ makers from Nordrhein @-@ Westfalen may not choose the country .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they have understood .
in 2005 , the European elections will not again take place at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ iner Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year .
for more than so far it is not : summer holidays , heat and land @-@ sw@@ elling - this is ours .
the locals , who are to be convinced by the elect@@ oral women are on vacation .
most of the vac@@ ation@@ ers that are in the country , on Us@@ edom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are no locals , so do not choose the land .
moreover , practical problems : in the holidays are assistant , the Posters are hanging , bu@@ bble fl@@ b@@ bles , fl@@ yers re@@ distribute and at the end of the votes , only effort@@ less to apply .
until the 4th of September 2016 , the elect@@ oral and last Feri@@ ent@@ ag , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has once again been taken over to the people over the people .
the hot phase if you can say that at all has just begun .
and it is also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must be for his ministry .
the SPD , since 1998 the strongest party , now lies in surveys clearly behind the CD@@ U .
thr@@ illing is how strong Ne@@ ul@@ ing Af@@ D cuts and what remains at the end of co@@ ali@@ tion@@ ality .
cel@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 re@@ forming , makes an almost in@@ con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous elect@@ oral campaign , one sees from his grand@@ children .
he travelled through the land , distri@@ butes ro@@ ses and pl@@ au@@ ks a little with the people , just as it has already been his legendary according to Harald Ring@@ storff .
otherwise , soul @-@ ering can get old feet and gives ch@@ anc@@ ellor Merkel to blame for the blo@@ om of Af@@ met@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your refuge@@ e policy , you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ uli@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; acceler@@ ates the rise of leg@@ ion@@ ship , which is going to cost him probably the beautiful ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U with its Spitz@@ enk@@ andi@@ daten , the Interior Lorenz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already seen how it is when you make the wrong time at the right place .
she has invited twice the ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel to grand@@ parents ; Merkel Bundestag is located in the north @-@ east .
but the target group did not vote , there were more North Rhine @-@ West@@ phal@@ ia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern and Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority of other Länder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compl@@ ained Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in NDR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is also a shame not to hear from other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel will listen .
otherwise the North @-@ CD@@ U dis@@ claim to the usual elect@@ oral campaign on market spaces and in front of shopping centers with umbre@@ llas and air ballo@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that , so , Kok@@ ert , plays only a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subordin@@ ate role &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also the Union also noticed that you should take the base on the land that it must be very strict , again a dragon to find the people again .
you are going on the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : in the sides of the country barely any present .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of the CD@@ U elect@@ oral campaigns to his co @-@ election is also sel@@ fish : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to go there , namely where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden weddings , every birthday party must be utilized . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because much is at stake , Sell@@ ering his SPD has now called to a particularly dedicated elect@@ oral campaign .
in surveys , the Socialists and Democrats finally ended with 22 percent behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and only just before Af@@ met@@ us ( 19 ) .
in 2011 , the SPD also had clearly gained by 35,@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
the Gre@@ ens , petty @-@ party with seven percent in the poll@@ s , are likely to prepare the leap in the land@@ tag .
they make out of the holidays dist@@ ress a modern virtu@@ e and place their elect@@ oral campaign in the internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online @-@ campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it calls the Landes@@ Officer Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise the green elect@@ oral cont@@ ests will start looking for local stimulation among the tourists .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ jek , the nickname did@@ inum , cur@@ v@@ t straight with a hous@@ ebo@@ at by the m@@ ec@@ kl@@ en@@ burg@@ ische lakes and finds it even beautiful .
your impression : &quot; choice in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not punishment . &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ rehabilitation : restaurants suffering from pl@@ ywood
at the speed , with which the B 27 is re@@ constructed , there is nothing to complain about .
for those responsible for the construction works that begin at 5.@@ 30 in the morning and only until 20 clock , there is all praise praise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have made everything quite delicate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tells El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff by the Jet pet@@ rol station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is no default .
the construction site could be moved to the south at the weekend as scheduled to the south until the end of October everything will be ready .
pra@@ ised will also be the withdrawal of those responsible for the construction work , approximately when it comes to setting up a rule .
since the construction site was w@@ ander@@ ed on Monday to the south and also the pl@@ ywood of the asp@@ erg@@ on@@ straße in Of@@ ter@@ dingen was removed and thus also the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg is back , the traffic situation within the place has relax@@ es .
the citizens can now proceed from Of@@ ter@@ dingen from the B 27 once more .
the ref@@ us@@ al traffic from the place seems to be returned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was partly considerable discomfort , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the responsible management of the rehabilitation and responsible assistant Manager Florian King . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the inhabitants of Bach@@ er@@ straße , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ nerst@@ raße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many mu@@ ch@@ ew@@ ays were examined and rather their Nav@@ i trusted as the sign@@ age .
what led to that of man@@ di@@ ver trucks in resi@@ dences .
as the vel@@ ocity limit did not meet , the community claimed to be strengthened by the instrument of M@@ ös@@ sing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was significant over@@ riding , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says King , who made himself spot over the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two or three per minute have been cr@@ ushed .
the quick@@ est was with 77 kil@@ ns at the pace @-@ 30 @-@ zone on the go .
since the construction has been with@@ drawn , it has become more calm .
for the business@@ men at the B 27 it is just a small con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg , now the street is open again .
at the same time , business@@ men do not hesitate to look .
but that the B 27 @-@ refur@@ bish@@ ment has led to them with sales wag@@ ons , everyone who asks you to look .
however , some are more and some less affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; who has to do less with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end customer &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; so for other companies , for whom has no consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also in the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Maier , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maximum light drop , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but also a means that of course , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mil@@ eage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the strongest ge@@ ared are the Local along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , holder of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , former crown , finds clear words .
this is already exist@@ ential .
not only him , but all those who have made it &quot; hard . &quot;
the customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil .
we need to be glad about each and every euro turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the sales revenue is based on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weit über 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the stre@@ aming of the street has dis@@ car@@ ded its operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
half of his staff members have dism@@ iss@@ ed .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and the half would have been released , politics would have responded differently .
instead , government president Jörg Schmidt on a request of G@@ öh@@ ner , whether there could be an financial compensation , the guest house benef@@ ited otherwise from the advantages of the location on the B . now they also find the dis@@ advantages that contribute to the restau@@ ration .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows of other coun@@ ties where something of funding have been handled .
with all types of suits , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his guest house will continue .
after all , the family business has been located since 17@@ 15 , he refers to the long history .
that other tri@@ gg@@ ers are now subject to a less common visit because of the complicated traffic performance , it can understand .
if you cannot go down , it is also what else beautiful .
that its stem cell after the end of the re@@ organisation comes back again , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt .
despite the crises with B@@ SE and bir@@ d@@ staircase , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the impact of B 27 @-@ construction works on his clients for the greatest crisis that has experienced its Gast@@ stätte in their long history .
six months of construction work is already brut@@ al .
constantly being rob@@ bed in the name of the counter @-@ terrorism in laws .
after the recent attacks , interior ministers de Ma@@ izi@@ ère now has a di@@ ck@@ ly safety package .
but what does a Dul@@ ce status have to do with terror ?
and what does the co@@ ali@@ ac@@ tion@@ ate say to all this ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the failure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically sensitive &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the Federal Minister of Finance in the presentation of his new safety package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are not asking for anyone .
others , further points would first be discussed within the parties .
I also participated in this .
as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as an inner Minister , he is located in the outcome and at a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; retreat &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the Coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère after recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach had to leave a little time before he presents his conclusions for the security in the Republic .
but these are now all the more widespread .
some of it is known to announce , loc@@ ates , that a new security unit is supposed to take care of the b@@ aking communication , is not new .
also , it is not the fact that Germany must apply several EU policies to air passengers and arms legislation .
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities does not come surprising .
in part de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , a second attempt for suggestions that has not yet to make sympath@@ etic for terr@@ ac@@ groups under penalty and ji@@ ha@@ dist@@ s with dou@@ bling citi@@ zenship swe@@ eps the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these will be difficult points for the SPD &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; sp@@ out of the CD@@ U @-@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he still consider this to be reasonable and challenge even if there is no chances at the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ ist anyway .
a few new ideas presented de Ma@@ izi@@ ère .
they are partly in itself : he is planning quick procedure for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for de@@ tention of people before displ@@ ac@@ ement .
refugees who are target@@ ing specifically in the country should be examined before their smartphones and disclose social media account for a safety review .
with claims for expi@@ red asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to make some worse than so far - such as such , the criminal off@@ ences commit or their papers were deliber@@ ately throwing to wear their identity .
some of them is political and legally un@@ cle .
man@@ ches also appears to be un@@ balanced and leaves questions open .
and with some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of thr@@ ott@@ oman for example - the question arises : what does this actually have to do with security and terror ?
yes , de Ma@@ iz@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the issues of refugees and terror .
but it is not easy to dis@@ agree that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
in addition , many people have been concerned about the high levels of refuge@@ e about security .
and things that are deeply occupied by the people , they themselves were not su@@ br@@ ated in election periods .
the inner safety is enormous in focus .
first rab@@ bet in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the insurance is great .
and yes , there are elect@@ oral campaigns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Union and the SPD can therefore increasingly stand up with the subject of internal security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past few days we went about between the two parties .
only a gar@@ sti@@ ger argument over the furn@@ ishing of the Federal Police , then on a safety @-@ policy @-@ collection of some uni@@ ons @-@ interior ministers , in which the Ress@@ ources is also a Bur@@ ka ban and a return from dual citi@@ zenship .
de Ma@@ iz@@ ère is also pain@@ less here for ir@@ reconc@@ il@@ able notes .
from a revers@@ al of the double pass it is nothing .
we have the discussion in Germany .
they are new to participate , be not sensible .
and with a guy ban he did constitutional concerns .
whether its own package is st@@ un@@ constitutional at all corners and whether it is indeed &quot; reasonably &quot; is for the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ ate partner , only has to show itself yet .
there is some dr@@ ill@@ ings , which could take care of the dispute .
however , the SPD is currently trying to pro@@ filing himself on the subject of inner safety .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Part@@ eh@@ ef Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ aled carefully to be careful about the willingness and says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to the security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
still , Volkswagen sm@@ ug@@ ly comes through .
in spite of diesel prices , the deliveries are growing worldwide .
but not in all markets it is running smoothly .
when the online reaction there is work around a term .
Volkswagen starts with the disp@@ at@@ ches sent in the second half of the year .
in the course of the year , Europe &apos;s largest high@@ lighting may continue to show a plus in the past year despite the diesel aff@@ air , thanks to its many brands and quite well @-@ running markets .
however , in July the nuclear brand VW primarily weak@@ ened primarily in Western Europe and weigh@@ ed thus again the total sales as that in the D@@ ax listed companies .
sold the brand VW in July with 4@@ 49@@ 100 cars 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year .
in Western Europe alone , to China the second most important market , sales lay 14 percent below the previous year .
in the home market Germany s@@ ack@@ ten the ship@@ ments to almost a six .
Mark@@ enver@@ vo@@ eb@@ ook@@ ef Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weak@@ est figures from July primarily on two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , in some core markets , there have been given a department of purchase in some core markets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the situation related to the cou@@ p attempt in Turkey also the British V@@ ot@@ um was deb@@ ated from the EU , explain a spok@@ es@@ woman .
in the U.S. , where the g@@ ass@@ aff@@ aires first escal@@ ated , is also on a min@@ us to be@@ ech .
big support for VW is the Chinese market .
in total , the mainly affected area of the state @-@ market of the Nieder@@ s@@ achsen is still further sm@@ ug@@ ly due to diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven month , only a supplier of 0,9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles is be@@ ech .
consolidated @-@ shar@@ pen@@ ed Fred Kap@@ pler could proceed from January to July further sales .
1.3 percent more vehicles supplied in this period , 5,@@ 9@@ 04 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated with a software subscription tests .
at alone in Germany , VW round 2,5 million cars , for retro@@ fit in the workshops .
in the course of the refur@@ bish@@ ment VW , that the alter@@ ation of the cars has no negative effects .
after the conversion of the vehicles there is no deteri@@ oration of fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor capacities .
we select the customer after completion of a &quot; Guarant@@ e@@ tion &quot; certificate but not by a &quot; guarantee &quot; of how it was owned on Friday in the company .
the reason are legal enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported the Volkswagen of his German customers now yet a guarantee of ins@@ ulated diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was confirmed on the last Monday VW @-@ representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Minister of Transport is confirmed that there was this meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has fulfilled the resolutions of my investigation Commission and to the full extent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; discre@@ pan@@ cies will not accept &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; stated Federal Minister Alexander Dobr@@ in@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
VW has assumed the guarantee that for fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor power after the conversion of no deteri@@ or@@ ations are held and all type of authorisation @-@ relevant vehicle values have been fixed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen himself uses the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not how it was owned by business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the wide term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; provides Volkswagen the possibility that buyers coming for example a hal@@ ary year after the retro@@ fitting about an engine time , and this will lead to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even in the customer interest , it is important to avoid that in case of any other damage , which have nothing to do with the ab@@ g@@ ass@@ ing sc@@ andal , to ensure uncertainty with regard to possible warran@@ ties , as it says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s why VW the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not use . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank G@@ mund at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands from rich Spar@@ kling - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bank@@ note Josef Paul spoke on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s just about 139 customers , who run 40 million euros at Gi@@ ro@@ - or any day @-@ monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German association German banks speaks of an individual and does not see a signal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal as@@ par@@ agus would need &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not to pay for their austerity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
wareh@@ ous@@ ing banks money over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay to their 0,4 percent prison .
this fee demands the Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank G@@ mund from September of private and corporate clients for deposits over 100.000 euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or any day @-@ cash accounts .
&quot; the first 100,000 Euro are free . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100.000 costs more than 400 euro per year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has had some time 40 million Euros that could be taken from one day to another and that it would not be worth spending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bank account for me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 per cent costs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chief chef . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can not lie for every million 4000 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs will be passing on after the push @-@ up principle now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; money simply can be found in the Tres@@ ors of the Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; would be much too dangerous : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have experienced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already four times , I don &apos;t have the fifth ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the ban@@ ker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most customers would have an understanding and rarely on other investment forms .
only a few immig@@ rated to other banks .
the co@@ operative association of Bavaria declared : &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the ECB is significant at all banks . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it alone to wear , be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; labour @-@ economically permanently not possible &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks therefore have increased their fees for account , credit cards or bank transfers .
with pen@@ alties for deposits of three million Euros had made the Th@@ urin@@ gia folk - and Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank Alten@@ burg Land with its Skat@@ bank branch 2014 head@@ lines .
Michael Kem@@ mer , leader of the banking union , said : &quot; we don &apos;t expect that private customers to pay with cover covered for deposits , this competition is much too strong in Germany and savings banks . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said , at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see , there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a client that is equipped with a little lush . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be a problem for a small bench if they have free money on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 1911 Gr@@ founded Gen@@ ossen@@ pap@@ st G@@ mund has du@@ g@@ ations in Bad Wies@@ see , R@@ ott@@ ach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .

the President of the Bundes@@ verband der deutschen Volks@@ ban@@ ken und Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ ban@@ ken ( Bv@@ R ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ ling , had declared the end of June : &quot; the thres@@ hold , into the neg@@ atives , is very , very high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in fact the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely buyer .
it is also not a hor@@ des through amateur collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older plat@@ former times retain their feelings rather for itself ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it alone time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
if this blog would be a message report on TV , I would follow me the camera while in the middle of a bust@@ ling street in S@@ oho , a hum@@ ble strike , my hands stop and something determin@@ ant like : &quot; so , let us take a closer look at it . &quot;
so let &apos;s take a look at it .
even though the heart of S@@ oh@@ os is slowly introduced to his charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where independent seller have been located - there are still a hand@@ ful of fantastic record stores .
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to turn the camera to the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observation .
Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , which I followed by Si@@ ster Ray ( Dat@@ es : two young women , three men middle ages ) into the Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( data number : eight men medium age , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a Coll@@ ector , I wonder ?
&quot; I already treasure , &quot; he says .
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates .
these sound@@ boards , top left ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I am not followed by e ) , dress the walls of his living room .
the reason why he possesses such a considerable number of albums and sing@@ les , is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy plates , which he could not afford to buy them as they appeared , when he was young and pl@@ ast@@ ness .
&quot; many things I Buy , are out of the late 60@@ s , early 70s , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things , in which I was probably something too young to buy them , &quot; he says .
he agre@@ es that those who are buying , rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and likes to spend alone time and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I drink not much .
this is my push .
wet , 25 , who works at Si@@ ster Ray also believes that many customers that he meets on the You@@ Go@@ v &apos;s profile .
however , he has also noticed a new wave of people who have heard about the media , people who have heard about the com@@ eb@@ ack and demonstrate their old records to buy again .
from the conversations that I have led , people usually have dism@@ iss@@ ed so to 1998 or 1999 of their collection .
customers that once sold their records to buy themselves , sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom of trailer of the turn@@ table of a certain age .
but what about the inn@@ ate emotional meaning of plates ?
it takes only a few seconds in a shop such as Ph@@ onica so as to realize that record stores a soo@@ thing community of like @-@ minded people .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers participated in the cont@@ act@@ less payments system .
some record @-@ fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar sound labels , from objects , the happy Ju@@ gen@@ der@@ inn@@ ings .
&quot; I think , sometimes it can be the col@@ t of a emp@@ tin@@ ess or property of material poss@@ essions as a kind of con@@ sol@@ ation , &quot; says WE@@ Z .
this is my collectors so I think it is with many people so .
it is a simple way to deal mentally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like her social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fle@@ ills a staff from a plat@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey of IC@@ M in April revealed that nearly 50 % of the people who bought a record , they have not heard yet .
the survey took also out that 41 % possess a turn@@ table they never use , whereas 7 % of those who buy a record , no turn@@ tables .
at this time of the message report I would probably be very worried , while I bl@@ ended by a st@@ acks to Bos@@ sa Nova compos@@ il@@ ations .
J@@ onny , 42 , who works in the case of sounds of the Universe ( including three men in the middle age ) , has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy of the Re@@ vi@@ vals &quot; of the Re@@ vi@@ vals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone was recently clean here and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no record player , but I would like to buy a radi@@ oh@@ king noise , so I can put them into the shelf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a great percentage but it is definitely going .
more products are blow@@ n , less po@@ stage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have people who say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no record player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are younger people , not older , who only slowly rise .
stop , which has devoted to the Schall@@ platten almost a whole floor , has a b@@ lower audience , when I return .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make pictures , teenagers and women middle ages .
even though the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the aforementioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts New and@@ es@@ thesi@@ zers - Wild Be@@ asts New thesi@@ zers - and the right @-@ packed pop instead of experimental jazz dr@@ acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed from the loud@@ speakers - it is good to see such a diversity among customers .
none of them looks lon@@ ely lon@@ ely , but nag@@ ging psych@@ ical trau@@ mas are hard to as@@ sert when you stand up next to someone 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , runs around in the shop for some minutes and looks at the variety of plates for sale .
it is more of a sh@@ ov@@ sky over a large purchase .
it does not earn much , so the collecting of records is not a real option , she says .
it costs a lot .
it is easy to hear music from one computer or to another , but the beauty of plates is ... &quot; it drives with a de@@ ar@@ able si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it is truly unique .
my last stop is a business that is said that a new generation of record lovers is to be inspired : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I give the an@@ al@@ ight , the je@@ ans @-@ Hot@@ p@@ ants to patterns , watching a group of young teenagers that group@@ ed for a moment to score polar cameras before a father and daughter hang out to buy a cros@@ ley turn@@ table .
on the left there is a stair@@ well , a wall full of plates of Ad@@ ele , J@@ eff Bu@@ ckl@@ ey , Amy Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
nobody sees her - perhaps because they are only purely decorative , some as far above that it is impossible to grasp it .
it is pure &quot; art @-@ art . &quot;
but considering that every attraction for these items mean more money for the industry and some customers might send to the depths of S@@ oh@@ os for more , there is nothing to complain .
there is no surprise that a population group , which has more time and money than others , the one that is most luxurious , as well as plates .
even if my research were buried , that the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote , they , at least in record business in S@@ oho , the large number of female collectors and record lovers who exist in reality , record business and in online for@@ for@@ en , un@@ considered .
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
they spend their Thursday morning with certainty not with the stroll through record stores , Ber@@ wick Street and leaf through plates , while they over@@ looks the star@@ ring of an un@@ cann@@ y , 30 @-@ year wrong moder@@ ator who rises over the shoulders of the middle aged over the shoulders .

French Court dis@@ continued offer on demo@@ lition of shops in the jungle of refuge@@ e camps
a French court has rejected a quotation from authorities in Calais , do@@ zens of provisi@@ onal shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais , in the thousands of refugees live , cr@@ ack@@ down .
at a trial , this week argu@@ ed the authorities in Calais that the state should ref@@ rain from 72 tent@@ ative business , in which persons inside the camp merchandise , sell cigar@@ ettes to En@@ erg@@ ydr@@ inks , sell , hair@@ dres@@ ser services or sell meals for a few euros in provisi@@ onal restaurants .
the Pre@@ f@@ ecture Calais was argu@@ ed that these places should be cr@@ ushed because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which incorporate a fire and san@@ itation risk .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian groups shared with the Court that businesses and restaurants are important because the free meals are offered by the government supported by government and other groups , not sufficient food for growing numbers in the camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they also out that the provisi@@ onal business and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the exp@@ ul@@ sion of people who operate the 72 pro@@ vis@@ or business , but t@@ apping that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Calais . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the judge Jean @-@ François Moll@@ a said that the food shops , cafes and restaurants can play a much bigger role than just people feed that live in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that the areas of quiet meeting between refugees and volunteers have to offer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the places that was threatened by Nieder@@ re@@ issen was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos;@@ Café des Lag@@ ers , the non @-@ profit and French classes as well as advice on asylum seek@@ ers for hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0,000 people signed the petition to maintain the Kids &apos;@@ Café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was that the closing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these children of a catastrophe would be the most recent eight years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two auxiliary organizations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Auberge des Mig@@ rants met on Friday that the number of people in the jungle who has risen to more than 9,@@ 000 people - the highest number up to now - after a steep rise in Neu@@ ank@@ le in the course of summer .

here comes the En@@ forcement Trailer
Germany R@@ aser must set off on the next generation of speed units : in various federal states , among other things in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash devices are tested , the Tem@@ pos@@ ac should be particularly effective .
the fut@@ ur@@ istic acting En@@ forcement trailer the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can for example be used at random points , where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on highway construction sites or transfer bridges with temporary tem@@ poles , there are often no necessary infrastructure to ensure there with a stationary b@@ unker for compliance with speed limit .
a continuous mobile structure can be too dangerous or consuming .
the En@@ forcement Trailer is self @-@ sufficient : its battery holds five days , the case data is encrypted via a modem .
laser measurement technology can also be captured all vehicles across multiple tracks simultaneously .
variable speed limit , as well as from tran@@ sc@@ ents to time , lanes and vehicle class can also be monitored .

great Britain cuts Silver in the 7 @-@ er Rug@@ by , after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold
the impressive performance of Britain at the 7 @-@ er Rug@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt halt at the final hur@@ d@@ le in the final hur@@ d@@ le in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were be@@ aten with a result of 43 @-@ 7 in the De@@ odoro Stadium in Rio .
Fi@@ ji r@@ ushed a master class in handling , Side @-@ Step@@ ping , retro@@ sp@@ y , liner and raw power to win gold - their first Olympics of any color .
the defeat was won by the not too bad Tro@@ phy of the Silver med@@ al , Great Britain to this day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they sm@@ ote New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the marked defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ fin@@ als on the same day could fall back to them in the finale .
but regardless of it , Fi@@ ji would have be@@ aten this form a 15 @-@ man team in punishment .
it could be a tro@@ st for Britain - but will probably not - that at least a Br@@ ite tomorrow will hang a gold med@@ al around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is Ch@@ ef@@ trainer Ben Ryan , the former boss for England made of Wim@@ bl@@ edon .
the UK had a difficult path behind it .
eight years ago she lost at Ryan every game with the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they lost only one .
this b@@ ump will w@@ ning , but the progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji began wonderful and left the GB@@ s from a lot of fun .
it felt for the captain Tom Mitch@@ ell and Co . when you were going in driving co@@ aches . the World Series @-@ winner went 5 @-@ 0 to the top , as O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au in the corner .
with four minutes of Play@@ time Jerry Tu@@ w@@ ai added another attack out of the right corner that he walked .
12 @-@ 0 and GB barely got the ball .
a h@@ ank@@ rag@@ ing T@@ ress of Mitch@@ ell stops the mountain of man Leone Nak@@ ara@@ wa a third gate , but it has Fi@@ ji only stopped .
in the seventh minute l@@ ete J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua in the right corner a touch@@ down , and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ara@@ wa added a new since the re @-@ poster and there was still over a minute game time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pre@@ ached by further weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB team and turbul@@ ent up to the line to make a gate .
the transformation brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
it is so , as if Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while GB is still se@@ eded .
this is how it is .
the GB caused fundamental changes to the half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time , until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova went through to a brilliant m@@ play of Fi@@ ji .
Dan N@@ ort@@ on started an attempt for GB , made a touch@@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game ran for a long time in favor of the South African , whose fans s@@ angen he@@ ed and d@@ anced at the ble@@ ach@@ ers .
it was not hard to admire the play@@ ful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a Vi@@ li@@ ame made the i cake with another try in the last seconds .
the wh@@ fi@@ ff pat@@ ched , the Fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ bs and GB k@@ ick@@ ed cr@@ ushed into the law@@ ns .
formerly on the day Fi@@ ji Japan in the semi @-@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 defe@@ ated and the United Kingdom ur@@ ged South Africa in a cr@@ acking @-@ match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s transformation of difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks in the first half to the front , but Dan N@@ ort@@ on broke the line with an impressive pedic@@ ures and sco@@ red a gate among the post in the second half .
a brilliant late tac@@ kling Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ month teams , secured the profits - and therefore the Silver med@@ al .
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning through the fight with the cancer of the trainer for rowing machine
there will be no em@@ ot@@ ene gold than with these games and that wants to be called .
from the first be@@ ak to the last , 220 hard chi@@ ev@@ ing that go into history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in its golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even if it was only the ding@@ ers , which were at the ruin , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was all present as they were at the second Olympics in two without tax @-@ wife , the first women in the history of the British sport , which laid an on such a scale .
their domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all their sco@@ ot@@ ted un@@ trained use , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled .
what we see are two brilliant athletes , which flo@@ ck over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ elling which does not reflect the type of tri@@ um@@ ph@@ es .
behind each gold in Ru@@ ders is a batt@@ ali@@ on willing to contribute to the incre@@ mental progress that would make the difference and it was no assistant at the same as the coach , who would not survive at all , when he was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said he was ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer , the op@@ eri@@ able and this did it .
if you do not , it spread everywhere .
it would have been a rather hard@@ est situation .
it changes a little bit of view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , beyond the season , could begin to have the inter@@ ruption to a minimum if that under such circumstances is the right term .
I needed money , so I had to go back soon .
it was an incentive .
I was in hospital and ran around at the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps were pleas@@ ing .
this is how it begins .
the Ru@@ ders is already a challenge , but this makes it even greater .
in the in@@ medi@@ ability of victory went their first thoughts on Williams , who spent a ner@@ ven@@ er@@ rolling in the morning to talk about anything more than usual , and thus tried to process his own fears .
p@@ anning , which was as captain in the Royal Arti@@ ll@@ ery Reg@@ iment in a bet in Afghanistan , &quot; I was this week an emotional wre@@ ck . this is perhaps something extremely , but it means so much . &quot;
it only repeated , how much I mean and Hel@@ en and Robin worked .
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
without Robin , we would be no one , therefore , a massive Thanks to him . he is the best coach of the world .
I could not have better myself for exercising or better trainers .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have lost no race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm , with which their opponents were unable to keep up with it .
even in the last 500 meters , when teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to close , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were very caught at the moment .
Hel@@ en called &quot; keep in process , lead in the process . &quot;
it is really important to not let it pl@@ uck up .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not trying to make some pots .
we didn &apos;t want a fire@@ work , we just wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race what we did .
the couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about his future .
Glo@@ ver must appear next week at a wedding , their own with the TV @-@ advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she wants to enjoy the moment .
I did not want to say that this was my last race .
this would have too much pressure .
in London it lasted approximately six months to understand that I am an Olympi@@ as .
it was all so new to me and I was so gest@@ ure .
here it took about four minutes .
that feels so much better , &quot; she said .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man has called by us and stated his life @-@ mate shot , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said a polic@@ eman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpet@@ rat@@ ors may be upon the run , after him I will publicly prev@@ ail .
meanwhile nation@@ wide , because S@@ ven S. could be on the road with the car .
the man is about 1,80 m tall , mus@@ cular , brown , brown and has a gl@@ aze .
meanwhile , the police have released a photo of him .
it is however a couple of years old .
in the meantime the man is carrying a gl@@ aze .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he can still bear the weapon with you , so the police .
wer S@@ ven S. looks , should the 110 call .
the police speaks of a &quot; relationship of relationships . &quot;
the sacrifice was the year 1988 , the perpet@@ rat@@ ors of 1981 .
the competent police in Lübeck did not want to make any information about the ather@@ gang or the relationship between perpet@@ rat@@ ors and victims ; however , they confirmed that a man has been killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a killing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more we are currently not saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a polic@@ eman in Lübeck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
eye @-@ witnesses estimated that was a special plac@@ ando ( SEK ) at the Tat@@ ort .
steel - Licht@@ blick for German St@@ ah@@ lindustrie
the crisis @-@ exploited and energy @-@ cat@@ ching German steel industry remains of additional costs in Million@@ aires .
financial loads , which threat@@ ens the sector from the green electricity promotion , are from the table .
it abi@@ ding in the liberation of renewable energies system in the components for so @-@ called autonomy in the German steel industry , &quot; Bundes@@ minist@@ ini@@ ster Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutscher Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Fri@@ day@@ station ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really glad that we were able to finally reach negotiations after two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the European Commission was initially planned , the steel manufacturer , the gases coming from the Ho@@ cho@@ res for electricity generation for your own consumption , to check out .
the steel sector &apos;s steel industry accounts for additional costs from 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , it now yield a reference certificate with the European Commission after talks with Un@@ fair commission@@ er in Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when the generators used in the steel panels are replaced in case of an E@@ EG circulation of 20 percent .
but even this will not be raised in the steel industry .
the IG Metall facilit@@ ated the agreement of Germany with the European Commission for their own production .
so that the status quo of the previous regulation will be largely ignored .
particular importance have the successful effort of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Steel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others need to follow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in the reform of the E@@ TS are climate and employment targets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; IG Metall @-@ Chef Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from over capacity since the 2008 financial crisis and a considerable price pressure .
last year the situation continues to tigh@@ ten the situation than the world &apos;s largest al@@ um@@ ented China given rise to the weak@@ est demand of mass in the world market .
European manufac@@ tures of Chinese steel @-@ cutting price @-@ dump@@ ing .
over the course of this spring the situation has a little relaxed .
on the one hand tra@@ ded in@@ im@@ pe@@ y effect , on the other hand the economic prospects in China have established itself .
un@@ clear how sustainable the price is reco@@ vering .
the German Ci@@ pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp remained careful on Thursday .
finally the prices would be st@@ agn@@ ated again .
the sector is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp said therefore also not to exclu@@ de the lo@@ oting of individual works .
in the German steel sector , around 86@@ 000 people were employed by the end of 2015 .
in July the German steel producer remains careful in spite of rising prices and increasing orders .
they produced more than 3.4 million tonnes of six percent less raw materials than in the previous year , such as the Economic union of Steel on Friday .
after a short increase in May , the amount consumed has now returned to each other for the second month .
since the beginning of the year , production rose by two percent below the previous year &apos;s prior year .
the association counts in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation with a rising output .
community , spirit , health : sing sen@@ iors good
the S@@ ingen has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp already her whole life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , at the teacher studies they occupy the subject of music , and today s@@ ings the 78 @-@ year @-@ old in a sen@@ iors .
&quot; sing me - emotional and physically , &quot; describes it .
after a sample she feels balanced , cheer@@ ful and a total of living , she says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; close to doing her health and spirit is something good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for singing is equal to several perspectives a great hobby for sen@@ iors , says Erhard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German Sen@@ it@@ liga .
most sen@@ iors sing in the choir and sharing with like @-@ minded the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
through regular inter@@ iors , sen@@ iors can establish social contacts and cultiv@@ ate them .
because often , dis@@ solve social and family structures at age , a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience also has made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in their choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to speak and organize themselves on the other - a choir is a very special form of being . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in a positive sense , means H@@ ac@@ kler .
for doing sen@@ iors a deep and controlled breathing .
wh@@ o@@ ever calls his l@@ ungs regularly , but also in everyday life not as fast as the pu@@ est .
even if it is about getting the sound of voice in the age , singing is an optim@@ istic hobby .
in older people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , Ursula L@@ enz tells of the federal law of the sen@@ iors of the sen@@ iors .
in the older generations , the joint S@@ ingen had a much higher priority , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and leisure , it is explained .
L@@ enz often proves that the singing or hearing of songs in older people ar@@ ouses many memories , often associated with positive emotions of their youth .
through lyrics and especially mel@@ o@@ dies themselves de@@ men@@ ced people back on long back events .
in singing , the head is also demanded for a particular performance , L@@ enz is also explained .
at the same time , to concentrate on one &apos;s own voice and to adapt to a pre@@ determined rhythm - that is a major co@@ gni@@ tive challenge .
just older people who live alone , practice so not just focus on himself .
another positive aspect is the acknowled@@ gment that one lear@@ ns through the singing in the choir , means H@@ ac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
also the self @-@ esteem grows through the singing in the choir .
to show yourself : if I &apos;m for something long , I will get better and wo@@ ke beyond me - this experience rein@@ forces me .
good reasons to start with singing , there is so enough .
wh@@ o@@ ever wants to try a new hobby , should not hesitate - even if he means to have little talent , betra@@ y L@@ enz .
you don &apos;t s@@ ings just - at 50 Sin@@ ating people who hear who hear when a tone is next to it ?
in search of the right offer sen@@ iors have different possibilities , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
sing someone from the familiar circle in a senior choir , you can simply connect .
many cities also offer insights about choirs in the surroundings .
wh@@ o@@ ever wants to sing in a cl@@ esi@@ ze choir can turn directly to the church or church officers .
many sen@@ iors also can be found via the internet .
anyone who has no access to the Internet can ask the family , friends or neighb@@ ors to help with the Internet .
wh@@ o@@ ever desire to sing , should definitely join a choir , betra@@ y H@@ ac@@ kler .
singing the soul is good and has something liber@@ ating - this applies to all ages .
Cats react sensitive to the kittens of the young animals
bi@@ ologists have investigated in Hanover , which effect the wh@@ ist@@ ing of cat@@ ni@@ bab@@ ys on adult animals has .
to her surprise , even the male did not let the males are not cold - however , they kept in contrast to the females always the same .
female cats can realize the arous@@ al level of cat@@ aly@@ bab@@ ys at the sl@@ ing of the little ones .
they react to ten percent faster to Lau@@ te of kittens , who are in great need , how scientists have found out of the Medical School and Medical School of Hannover ( MH@@ H ) .
K@@ ater also react on the herds of kittens - but always the same .
&quot; apparently the acou@@ sti@@ cal differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strongly er@@ ected females for the males either do not perc@@ ep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; said the Bi@@ olog@@ ne@@ Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding by the MH@@ H .
it is the first time in the study that was published on this Friday in the &quot; BMC Evol@@ utionary Bi@@ ology . &quot;
in a previous investigation , the research team had already found out that the duration and ton@@ height of the kittens , with the ur@@ gency of their weakness .
the total nine adult male boys and eight kittens from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the MH@@ H .
you were played for a stroll from the little ones , which were taken for three minutes from the throw box and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
for the others , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of more intense kittens , which were additionally raised .
the researchers keep their results despite the light sample , for expres@@ sive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all females , even those who had no own off@@ spring , re@@ differenti@@ ated to the hor@@ ror &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they turned up quickly to the loud@@ speaker when this ru@@ fe has been the very important kittens .
this ability may be cultivated or create with the sex@@ ually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the males at all re@@ acted , &quot; said the Bi@@ olog@@ in .
in the past , scientists have already studied the reactions of women and men on baby .
also , some studies showed that women are sensitive to inf@@ ants , regardless of whether they were already mothers or not , reported the Bi@@ olog@@ in Marina Sche@@ op@@ ann .
Po@@ dol@@ ski runs with &quot; Gala &quot; to the Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ r is a football leg@@ end in Turkey .
in Turkey against the one @-@ star so@@ ccer star Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ r was made a ar@@ rest warran@@ t .
he will be acc@@ used to be a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the cou@@ p attempt , a key football match takes place in Turkey .
in front of the Du@@ el of the Arch@@ bishop between visits to Istanbul and Luke Po@@ dol@@ sk@@ is Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul to the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya is the official line clear : &quot; business as well . &quot; is said .
already during the im@@ puri@@ fication of the acceptance test after the crash test in July the government , the daily life of norm@@ ality could not be com@@ promised .
this does not apply to those who susp@@ ected to be susp@@ ected the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len one which is responsible for the cou@@ p attempt .
at the same time , the so@@ ccer is not a halt .
against the former Star@@ k@@ ick@@ er Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ r presented the prosec@@ ut@@ or an ar@@ rest warran@@ t .
in the meantime , the ad@@ ren@@ ad was acc@@ used in America , as a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ k@@ r should be followers of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is made accountable by the President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an for the cou@@ p attempt .
although the condition is first mentioned for 90 days until October , actually it has the life of most towers but as good as no effects .
the nigh@@ tly &quot; Democracy @-@ W@@ ards &quot; on public places throughout the country has declared Erd@@ og@@ an on Wednesday for ends .
the sport is - like the whole country - split in followers and opponents .
particularly fans of the workers &quot; Alpine Club are traditionally not one of the friends of the President .
but what the Gro@@ s of the Turks , but considering most dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military cou@@ pl@@ ation .
even the fans can even get the fans - no matter if your heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or visits .
at Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger &quot; Gala &quot; it will be especially arriving on Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski .
his sporting value presented the Köl@@ ner in the expi@@ red season under evidence : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions ended the 31 @-@ year @-@ old his first game @-@ time as a Top@@ scor@@ er of his association .
in the end@@ game against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce , he sco@@ red the 1 : 0 @-@ victory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FAN@@ AT@@ IK &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; he was the best in the square . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he completed the season in an excellent way and secured his team the tro@@ phy .
thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di , &quot; the dis@@ appoint@@ ing season for the record teacher found a reconc@@ il@@ able conclusion .
after the Pre@@ round @-@ K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; Lion &quot; is made early in the European le@@ ague .
in the ad@@ per Li@@ g , there was only to rank six .
the season was not good .
Pok@@ al was the only way to gain something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have managed and that is the most important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master Col@@ kt@@ as , the game was running better .
above all thanks to Mario G@@ ome@@ z , who laid the foundation on the 14th title with 26 dec@@ ors of the season .
this is also the reason that the fans hope to return to the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
at the AC Florence , the G@@ ome@@ z Congress was known and announced just after the cou@@ pon &apos; G@@ ome@@ z after the cou@@ p attempt to return to the political situation in the country after its EM @-@ vacation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario still wants to come to us he only has to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; zi@@ pped the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ick@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clu@@ ster Fi@@ ery Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but to do this , the forward should be ready to give up around a third of its to 7.5 million euros , that we were clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his sal@@ ary to Florence we cannot pay &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite d@@ oping : these athletes have even medals @-@ chances in Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin was already locked twice due to D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lowers in Julia Step@@ an@@ owa may not start in Rio .
others sur@@ rendered ath@@ le@@ tics @-@ sinn@@ ers can only lau@@ gh at it - they fight in Rio for medals .
the topic d@@ oping are still looking for the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games in Rio .
the Russian swi@@ mmer in Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ owa , which had been charged to the games after a d@@ oping @-@ spi@@ erre du start quite shortly before the games , was filled with her start ( 100 meter chest ) gn@@ ment and out@@ dated .
it offered a sk@@ ar@@ cal scenario : with a put smile she was still decorated in the hall and had prov@@ oked with their performance .
as a state that they won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke into a jubil@@ ation .
but there are many other sport@@ s@@ men who are going to start the start despite the d@@ oping past at the Olympic Games in Rio .
here is an overview :
J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most contro@@ versi@@ al figures in the ath@@ le@@ tics .
he was locked two times because of D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
since his spell runs the Olympi@@ asi@@ an of 2004 and Ex @-@ World Champion even faster than before , he is about 100 m in 9,80 seconds the number one in the world and is considered to be the biggest challenge of Us@@ ain Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ y@@ ce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / Jam@@ a@@ ica ) : the two @-@ second Olympi@@ as and seven @-@ fold World Championships had to sit down in 2010 after having had the intake of pain by Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
after a surgery you had had heavy t@@ ooth@@ ache , he defended the 29 @-@ year @-@ old .
Sandra Per@@ ko@@ vic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : 2011 the Olympics of 2013 , World Championships was tested positive from 2010 to 2016 positive to the ver@@ ot@@ ene stimulation of meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amin .
Per@@ ko@@ vic be@@ str@@ ated the ignor@@ ant intake and became closed six months .
the four widest lit@@ ters this year will go to the account of the great Gold fav@@ ori@@ tin .
La@@ Sha@@ cht@@ sh@@ eba ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / USA ) : the Peking Olympi@@ asi@@ an and two @-@ mo@@ red world champion over 400 m , was in 2010 positive tested and 21 months been closed .
a means of Pen@@ el@@ ong@@ ation was responsi@@ bly , in@@ sured Mer@@ tre@@ k .
this year the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is over 200 and 400 m of the fastest man in the world .
I@@ wan T@@ ich@@ on ( Ham@@ mer@@ le , Belarus ) : probably barely any ath@@ l@@ eten were dism@@ iss@@ ed so many medals .
so lost T@@ ich@@ on his WM title from 2005 nine years later , after with him testosterone d@@ oping .
the now 40 @-@ year @-@ old had also had Olympia @-@ silver 2004 because of ster@@ oid cl@@ ings and the EM @-@ title 2006 because of testosterone @-@ consumption .
the termin@@ ated Bronze Medal of the Olympic Games in 2008 was given back to a judgment of the International Sport@@ Court of Audit@@ ors .
with 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m he is in rank two of the world list .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km G@@ ehen , China ) : the Wel@@ tre@@ k@@ ord@@ ances and Gold@@ is@@ ori@@ tin was not tested in May , but still may start in Rio .
at the 29 years old World Championships have been found evidence of taking a ver@@ ot@@ ene dietary supplement , the lock of the world @-@ anti @-@ d@@ oping agency W@@ ada fell mil@@ der and ran already on 13 July onwards .
Bom@@ ben@@ geschichte in Thailand - Austrian in@@ ju@@ red - berry T@@ ote
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand stand with the woman in contact , said the spok@@ es@@ person of the Ministry of Finance , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Fri@@ day@@ early .
I suffered Schn@@ it@@ tw@@ ders and had been treated in the hospital , but I have already left this time again .
your trip will be planned from the beginning of September .
whether from the further explo@@ sions on the vacations island Ph@@ uk@@ et as well as in the southern cities Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ GA , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ ph@@ on also are Austrian citizens are not yet un@@ clear .
the Treas@@ ury exist in this regard concerning constant contact with the local authorities , so mu@@ d@@ ll .
at about 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok downtown Hu@@ a H@@ in were first explo@@ ded on Thursday evening in a hin@@ ge of two bom@@ bs .
according to police , according to police , a Tha@@ is was killed and about 20 people were in@@ ju@@ red , including the Austrian , three Dutch , three pre@@ countries and three Itali@@ ans .
Freit@@ ag@@ early then again two jumping classes went high , according to the authorities a further person was killed .
also from Ph@@ uk@@ et was also reported a bom@@ bs in the morning .
at the Det@@ on@@ ation near the popular beach lovers popular Ba@@ dest@@ ran@@ ds Pat@@ ong was in@@ ju@@ red by police and taxi drivers .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani at the southeast coast of the country explo@@ ded then another bom@@ b which killed an urban@@ ization .
according to the authorities , according to the authorities in a flo@@ wery meadow , had gone into the air before the last four of the coastal police .
finally on the South West Coast and Tran@@ g called on the south @-@ western coast as well as in Ch@@ um@@ ph@@ on on the southeast coast .
you walk from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was called .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bom@@ ben@@ att@@ ent@@ ate carry the same hand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ar@@ me@@ eg@@ ener@@ al Dan@@ ai Krit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Fri@@ days early prior to journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that it is a co @-@ ordin@@ ated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is too early to express themselves possible moti@@ fs - most likely , however , it is about the works of Muslim reb@@ els .
also Thai media wanted to recognize a pattern with the attacks , which is typical for the Bom@@ ben@@ att@@ ent@@ ate mus@@ cular separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
on the other hand , the th@@ ail@@ ment police declared that attacks was not in connection with the Islam@@ ist re@@ tic movement or with the international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local Sab@@ ot@@ age , which is limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a speaker in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is rather that the bom@@ bs were laid by oppos@@ ites of the ruling military jun@@ ta .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities had received sec@@ l@@ esi@@ de references in the coming days in the south of the country - however they have not been informed of the exact time and places . &quot; &quot; &quot;
still un@@ clear , which group behind the attacks .
the police reported their officials in the entire country , security around important government buildings and airports , stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and am@@ us@@ ement districts .
in Thailand there are always smaller bom@@ bing attacks , but they usually do not align themselves to tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used over the years of Thailand &apos;s King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bo@@ l Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
after the destruction of the Bom@@ ben@@ ri@@ gen Bom@@ ben@@ explo@@ sions , the Austrian State Department recommends to its homepage , the instructions of the Thai security authorities .
high safety risks for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ iw@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah Vi@@ ews and surroundings .
after cl@@ ashes between security forces and Muslim people , no necessary journeys to these provinces will not be dem@@ ol@@ ished .
increased safety risks ( security level 2 ) yellow for the rest of the country .
the ass@@ aul@@ ts on Thursday and Friday after a few days after a contro@@ versi@@ al referendum on one of the military jun@@ ta worked out in the constitution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these sp@@ atial the military great influence even in the coming years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jun@@ ta leader and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ Ch@@ a said the bom@@ bs would have been an attempt to don@@ ate chaos , while the country is towards stability , an improvement of the economic situation and tourism .
the military in@@ ta , which had taken the power in 2014 after a phase of blo@@ ody repres@@ sion , continues to hold the kingdom again for stability and order .
however , the military has not succeeded in getting a grip on the far south of the country for years in the extreme south of the country .
more than 6,@@ 500 people have been killed in the conflict .
just under one year ago in Bangkok have been killed at a popular Hin@@ du Sch@@ purely 20 people - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the blo@@ ody attack of the younger history of the country .
the right &quot; identity movement &quot; is into the vision of the federal state for constitutional protection .
after several local dem@@ ons , the Con@@ st@@ ees in the Con@@ federation led the group under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identification movement &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Mr Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate the Deutsche Presse @-@ Agentur in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the immigrants addressed to Islamic faith or from the Middle East in extrem@@ ist way .
therefore , we observe the movement now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identification movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots that has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it turns against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mul@@ tik@@ it @-@ W@@ ahn &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; controlled mass migration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; loss of their own identity through foreign affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; constitutional in nine Länder - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Nieder@@ s@@ achsen , Saxony and Th@@ urin@@ gia - watch the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identification &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ ate said , his authority was closely align@@ ed with the leaders in the decision .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups like the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identification movement &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; to pick their target group where it stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Constitu@@ tional Treaty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
generally , extre@@ mi@@ sts , they speak with you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ ers music .
the identi@@ ties of Isl@@ ami@@ sts as well as right extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not commercial advertising for your own thing .
the propaganda should address the people emoti@@ on@@ ally .
young people are sus@@ cep@@ tible in a special way .
this is dangerous .
finally , it had been written in several federal states reports on contacts of the &quot; identification &quot; of Af@@ met@@ politicians .
Ma@@ ate said , he did not have knowledge .
for constitutional protection , possible contacts of this type only be relevant at a certain point .
it depends on whether the particular party - in this case the Af@@ met@@ ry - by certain individuals that are extrem@@ ist , its goal is changing and so extrem@@ ist .
decisive factor is whether such people have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not visible .
with a view to the marked increase in legal criminal off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refuge@@ e camps , Ma@@ ate said , he would not speak of new right terrorism in this context .
but we have found in recent years that it can be legi@@ ster@@ r@@ or@@ istic structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Fri@@ aler Group .
it can be quite clear that further justi@@ fy group@@ ings or small groups formed to plan the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refuge@@ e or attacks from other extreme right motiv@@ ations .
but a nation@@ wide or across Europe control of leg@@ ster@@ r@@ or@@ ism is not recogni@@ z@@ able .
the existing groups have emerged on the regional level or in social networks .
concerned Ma@@ ate about that many over@@ gri@@ ps went to the account of men who did not appear before in the right scene .
this is the wor@@ rying .
many of the Tat@@ an@@ tigen in attacks on asylum seek@@ ers have previously not been known as crime , politically motivated forces or followers of the right scene .

his time , he proposed only with a minute and nearly five seconds over the 100 meters of Fre@@ isti@@ l , played out there .
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
at the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney the run by Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i for medi@@ al attention .
unforgettable was the performance of the swimming pool from the Equ@@ atorial Guinea when he had to compete in a run of 100 meters of Fre@@ isti@@ l .
Fr@@ ene@@ tic has been fil@@ med m@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i at that time .
the then 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned only eight months before Olympia and had never been completed before the competition .

accidents - bus sli@@ pping in Kr@@ umm@@ hör@@ n in Gr@@ aben : 8 Ver@@ last
in an accident of a tour with 43 sen@@ iors on Thursday in Kr@@ umm@@ hör@@ n ( district Aur@@ ich ) , eight people have been wo@@ unded .
two of the in@@ stit@@ uting suffered severe inj@@ uries , distributed the police with .
the 66 years old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to diver@@ t her information according to a opposite push @-@ switch , which was partly on the road @-@ track .
the bus came to the right of the road and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch , like a spok@@ es@@ person of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the location of the bus , the people could not depend on the bus , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire@@ bri@@ g@@ ade liber@@ ated the passengers .
six ambul@@ ance ambul@@ ance and a p@@ arz@@ s came to the accident at the provincial road 2 .
the in@@ final travelers were brought back from a line @-@ bus to the Kr@@ umm@@ hör@@ ner District P@@ ew@@ sum .

the fees per cu@@ bic meters of waste is from 1st October 2016 for the area of the wast@@ ew@@ ater / Re@@ v / Wel@@ ch / Wh@@ den@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ ez 3,@@ 36 Euro ( up to 26 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 euro ( up to 2.@@ 18 Euro ) .
at the time of the plant in Az@@ endorf the waste water fee will be re@@ charged at the latest once more appropriate actions are needed .
after a high @-@ time lim@@ estone , the se@@ wage price in Az@@ endorf lie at 4,@@ 37 Euro per cu@@ bic meters .
as may@@ or Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , was noted during the approval of the budget by the Land@@ rats@@ amt Kul@@ mb@@ ach , that used for these se@@ wage systems .
the market of Kaz@@ endorf was obliged to operate in due to legal basis , making facilities free @-@ up .
from 1 October 2016 , the citizens as well as the commercial and industrial companies from Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ uth , Lin@@ den@@ berg und Z@@ ult@@ enberg deeper into the money bag .
the pipes increase between 48 and 67 percent .
how the Board of Herbert Schmidt was applied by the Advisory Board , a new calcul@@ ating of fees for the se@@ wage systems of the market community is necessary .
in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 there are also over@@ - or sub@@ mer@@ ings from the previous calcium period .
the grave eth@@ ers increase in Schmidt is that it deals with all three waste water systems for relatively small facilities with a very low waste water inf@@ est@@ ation , which is between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cu@@ bic meters per year .
thus , due to the low distribution of distribution for example , it would affect necessary repairs of several thousands of Euro .
moreover , the wast@@ ew@@ ater rise in all three lines will be slightly declined .
furthermore , in the underlying lim@@ iting period in all three lines , not least due to its age , san@@ itation and repair works in a considerable extent are fallen .
the plant in Az@@ endorf was almost 30 years old , the plants for pupp@@ ets , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth , as well as Z@@ ult@@ enberg , Lin@@ den@@ berg , and Lop@@ p for almost 20 years .
Schmidt de@@ pointed out that in the se@@ wage plant Az@@ endorf the mechanical ventilation system due to be exchanged due to damage .
in the p@@ ump@@ werk world @-@ dining , the nearly 20 years old p@@ umping industry had to be over@@ hau@@ led and den@@ oun@@ ced in the pond area Lop@@ p , after nearly 20 years operation of the first gar@@ dener , the frac@@ ture provides and an additional ventilation option to hold the water @-@ legal requirements too in future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to these extraordinary expenses were the advanced advis@@ or and maintenance costs that are taken into account in accordance with the new calcium period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which in the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 are still clearly under the current level .
stone houses made clear that during the small waste water fall into the three lines the expenditure for the operation and maintenance . &quot;
in doing so , suppl@@ emented Schmidt , the Market community of large entertainment cost at the se@@ wage systems in the past 20 years have remained spar@@ ed .
the situation for the above @-@ mentioned plants will continue to be prec@@ arious after view of stone buildings on the long term , especially since you cannot extend the supply area of the Ab@@ wasser@@ zw@@ eck@@ feder@@ ate Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ ach@@ tal for these systems , because it concerns de@@ itable institutions .

the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 % .

Snap@@ chat &quot; Anim@@ e &quot; -@@ Eff@@ ect as Asian car@@ ic@@ ature
Snap@@ chat says that this filter is animated , but some ob@@ servers say that it is uns@@ ensi@@ bly towards bre@@ eds .
with its fil@@ tering tool it take Snap@@ chat about 150 million daily users that change reality and play with identi@@ ties on such a way that already ends the absur@@ de .
you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting .
the filters are distinctive , arbitr@@ ary @-@ twi@@ sted tools that generate more than 30 million improved be@@ ers each day .
all the mis@@ steps go to the public .
Snap@@ chat filters have drawn in the past cri@@ tique you have been acc@@ used in which it would acc@@ used that the app was black@@ face or white skin as a beauty ideal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when it proposed a filter a filter , which gave them sl@@ ums , false teeth and pu@@ d@@ gy che@@ eks , there were some critics a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Money &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they asked if they repeated Kon@@ tro@@ ver@@ sen on a larger problem that the company has diversity .
the news and the sensation were widespread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and mother@@ boards , one day after Snap@@ chat r@@ ushed that it would have been the feature .
the company provided an exc@@ use : the filter was meant as a tri@@ bute to enter@@ tain@@ ees character and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced r@@ acial atism , rec@@ alled the filter at viol@@ ently c@@ lich@@ és .
others ref@@ ra@@ ined the Anim@@ e comparison .
in an e @-@ mail wrote Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student , whose Twe@@ et has been widely used over the photos that the filter was &quot; viol@@ ated and sealed . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to ar@@ gue with the return of a very hard Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the fil@@ tering effects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows that the filter is not successful , but that the terrain was drawn into the worst extre@@ mes .
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that cros@@ ses these cultural Stol@@ per@@ wir@@ ing .
American culture seems to be involved in an endless di@@ re and Integr@@ ation@@ fare , of conference rooms up to Hollywood and the equipment we all hold in hand .
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats big audience of young people - who in terms of race are di@@ vers@@ ed as their older opponents - could expect more of them , sensitivity to expect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if one of Snap@@ chat fil@@ tering is an image created for a user , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is much more difficult that such things remain un@@ noticed when it was earlier the case , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 25 @-@ year K@@ atie Zh@@ u in an interview on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday Zh@@ u , who works as product manag@@ er@@ ess and engineer for medium , you can cancel Snap@@ chat account , others requested to do the same .
in a reference for medium and in a phone conversation she said that she believe that r@@ acial @-@ related con@@ tro@@ s can reflect a lack of diversity with the adju@@ sting practices at Snap@@ chat .
Zh@@ u cri@@ tici@@ zed the big part of white , only male leaders , and ended up its appearance with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ ete@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce so that they can make such decisions , &quot; said the chin@@ ese @-@ American Zh@@ u , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but not in positions are in which they are safe or comfortable to say about it . &quot;
others share their mind , a complaint , the Snap@@ chat was mostly un@@ answered .
the company does not publish figures for the diversity of its employees and points to its status as a private company .
on Thursday , it take Snap@@ chat to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its employees , but according to a spok@@ es@@ man , the company recently focused a personnel responsible , focused on under@@ way population groups and internal integration efforts .
Zh@@ u said her turn , that she will let her Snap@@ chat account will be closed and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not o.@@ k@@ . ist . &quot;
military leadership of IS@@ IS Secret Services , introduces the Committee of Congress
Mil@@ itä@@ ran@@ nies of the United States Central Command shi@@ fted information to draw an optim@@ istic image of the war against the so called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , when the actual stat@@ uses on site would have allowed a investig@@ ative committee of Congress in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can members of the dispute , Secret Services , and the Wehr@@ bud@@ get@@ ary reports , reported by great dis@@ satisfaction under Central Command intelligence , the reported estimates made by American efforts to combat American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , shortly C@@ enc@@ om , is the military headquarters in Tamp@@ a , Florida , which controls the American military deploy@@ ments in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; message service information presented by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com Com@@ man@@ de@@ uren typically , signed a positive picture of the US efforts against terrorism when it has allowed the actual conditions on site and were consistently more positive than analyses of other messages services , &quot; quoted a newspaper article .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what should happen at Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers are suffering when poor analyses our political leaders are presented , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ken Cal@@ vert , re@@ publi@@ kan@@ al member of Repres@@ ent@@ atives &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the leadership in Cent@@ Com we@@ al@@ rich up to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report presents detailed problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the education of Ira@@ qi Ar@@ med For@@ ces .
although there is no direct reference to the fact that government works under Obama has given instructions , it shows how analy@@ st have exposed to the pressure of their pre @-@ laws , an optim@@ istic image from the threat of the Islamic state , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half year 2015 many Central Command Press releases , opinions and statements in front of the Congress , clearly positive than it corresponds to the facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; presented the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ Com has publicly announced that a military re @-@ conquest of Mos@@ elle can begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ sul ; the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by months of investigations , so much clearly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , re@@ publi@@ can@@ ic convention from Kan@@ sas , in an opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the middle of 2014 up to the middle of the year 2015 , the leaders of Central Command changed the following reports to play the threat of IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the re@@ public@@ ans called the Task Force in the Life after them was concerned that an@@ alysts were concerned with regards to the mani@@ p@@ ulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will still be completed by more detailed findings while the investigations will continue .
in addition , further investigations of Cent@@ Com reports are under@@ way by the Secretary of Defense .
democratic members of the new@@ sletters are published on Thursday their own findings , which with some of the conclusions adopted by the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2014 and 2015 the Cent@@ Com made an over@@ ly reduced process for the creation of renewable assess@@ ments on IS@@ IL and the Ira@@ qi security services , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the highest @-@ level democr@@ at in the Com@@ press , member of the Repres@@ ent@@ atives Adam B. Schiff , in an opinion known . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , as Mr. Schiff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consuming the publication of re@@ organisation reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ash@@ amed the mor@@ ality of an@@ alysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave a little space for different opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Mr. Schiff and Democrats made an indication of no indication concerning the attack of the White House in the Cent@@ Com analy@@ st in regard to a &quot; given political opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigations were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Beast . &quot;
in August last August , the New York Times reported by the govern@@ or of the Pent@@ agon , which were recorded according to the complaints of Cent@@ Com Analy@@ sts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a press spok@@ es@@ man of the Pent@@ agon , gave in an opinion that the Ministry of Defence would not yet be reports of the Congress , while the investigation of the general spec@@ imen is still in progress . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ gent opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence will welcome a contro@@ vers@@ y of these important issues in national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the investigations have beyond the question of a successful air campaign led by American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a statement that is in the meantime gained by an increasing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the alleg@@ ations of last year have raised the question to which President Obama can rely on the Central Command for hon@@ orary estimates of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the cri@@ tique of the dispute over the Islamic state amoun@@ ting to more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ sts , the dam@@ aging government under George W. Bush went ahead of the recommendations of many an@@ alysts , and a little time to make sure about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 thoughts .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the insur@@ rection against the current reporting of the Islamic State .
last year , the team around Mr. Hoo@@ ker has no significant impact on the declar@@ ations of the government of the Avi@@ ation government , as they would have had any significant impact on the financial situation of the terror group , since this provisi@@ onal refin@@ ery had been put into operation to sell oil on the black market .
however , this knowledge was not published , reported the Times in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger commands , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was cri@@ tici@@ zed by members of the legislative due to its superior positive assessment of the Warri@@ or at a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin went to retirement in April and was replaced at Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the USA won full match in the field ho@@ ckey of women , a show@@ down with the UK .
a day after they had shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 winner of Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates for the American Feld@@ ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that wa@@ ited the American female with 3 @-@ 0 .
five gates in two games should actually be a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said they could not remember that ever did .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I do not belong to the people who keep their gates in memory .
however , that knows though : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the ol@@ ym@@ pic competition , and are equivalent to their group with the Brit@@ ons on the first place , which after its 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan remain un@@ be@@ aten .
Britain and the United States will encounter on Saturday the first lap on Saturday .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which the two teams will get out of the first and second place inside their group .
the first is placed the strong Dutch got a little longer out of the way that the other group will lead .
as always the game may go on Saturday , the Americans have spar@@ ked their success story about their success story , four years after they lan@@ ded in the last London games on the last of 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years with a high Ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ ger in his hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at the Dre@@ xel university ) , with 16 years she became a National Player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
they missed the Olympi@@ ad in 2008 as they could not qualify for the Ka@@ der .
then the year 2012 came in which for her and her team did everything .
in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , became an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of National Team and thus the things began to turn better .
&quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am .
we did not have the working time in London that we now have .
we have pl@@ uck the rest of it completely .
on Thursday , B@@ am opened the tor@@ ch in the first half of the game with a return from the Middle area .
India had gone out into the game without victory in the tournament , but the team showed herself surprisingly , and kept the player from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am the game took into their hands .
she carried out a spr@@ int with the fla@@ p ball over the left side of Flan@@ ke , then moved into the middle and lu@@ pf@@ te the ball to the gate around the Americans .
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ zal@@ ez made the final goal in the center of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the door@@ ke@@ epers of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs that had to book now a gateway in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday .
in the middle of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the tramp@@ oline
wherever you are , as late as it is , there are the Olympic Games .
the events in Rio de Janeiro are feeling resistant and inev@@ itable , a rapid stag@@ gering between competition and endeav@@ our .
it is , as if the Olympic tor@@ ch itself would be a burning rod , which is protected from the watch@@ man to float to the tri@@ m to the tri@@ ath@@ l@@ eten .
you can not place the TV , read a newspaper or listen to the conversation of your neighbours in the qu@@ eue without talking about Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the argument between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there are Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women of black with di@@ m@@ ples could have entirely been sent under these known names , which would be sent to Prime Time by sponsors and benef@@ actors , if he would be a swi@@ mm@@ ers , Tur@@ ner or even F@@ genuine .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fought in the ol@@ ym@@ pic tramp@@ oline around gold .
the Olympic Fl@@ ame is not illumin@@ ated any event .
further from the centre , partly in the shadow are the sports that are not generally recognized : air sc@@ are , Archery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the chest swimming and may it be long reign .
but when I should be mod@@ est arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , let me direct the attention to the dis@@ crete charm of the tramp@@ oline .
although the tramp@@ oline has already been a ol@@ ym@@ pic event , when it had been in Sydney there was the last 16 years so much noticed that many people I asked , did not know that it is at all an Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ art .
this could also be regional ignor@@ ance .
despite the US Ath@@ l@@ eten for competition , it has never won a med@@ al in a tramp@@ oline and had a athletes , who made it up to the ends .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to divide the prizes for the men and the Chinese and the Kan@@ adi@@ er who share the women .
Dong Dong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend its gold med@@ al from London this year .
the tramp@@ oline @-@ jumping has a certain out@@ si@@ char@@ me , partly because it sounds a c@@ low@@ ed ear @-@ up for a c@@ low@@ job than the Olympic Games sound .
at this point I should ad@@ mit that I am not an expert , but only a tri@@ b@@ born revel@@ ant .
it has humor@@ ous potential - the kart@@ o@@ on@@ ous tre@@ m@@ bling of his never to s@@ wollen che@@ ers - but also the refin@@ ement of the gym and diving , the two sports , which are essentially united .
the word &quot; Tramp@@ oline &quot; comes from the Spanish El tramp@@ oline , which means as much as &quot; jumping board . &quot;
emerging winners jump on a gig@@ antic tramp@@ oline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements ( turning , pi@@ ke and sal@@ tos ) before they land on the feet .
they are evaluated according to official Olympics after the execution , difficulty and &quot; flying time . &quot;
two @-@ witness@@ ed athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , are signed in Rio to each other .
the common Olymp@@ us V@@ ector is almost straight .
med@@ alli@@ sts need to go further in their quest for gold , faster , up and beyond , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes back and back , upwards and down@@ wards on the playground .
they chase not only the or@@ ell@@ in@@ ia or the output wall , but also in the television transmission also another ca@@ tho@@ lic goal : the world or the Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ords .
the pur@@ pos@@ eful pursuit is no@@ ble , admir@@ able , even fan@@ ati@@ cal - and it is enough to sti@@ r even a crowd on tears .
but it is also what I imagine in the look of those games as something exhausted .
it offers the tramp@@ oline a re@@ pri@@ eve .
the v@@ ector of the tramp@@ oline is above .
a run@@ time is not the goal .
he or she pr@@ all@@ t , seem@@ ingly difficult as an astronom@@ er goes down , then down@@ ward , then effort@@ lessly back upwards .
also here there is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during exercise there is no h@@ ectic attack on the goal , no w@@ öl@@ den in the distance , but the dream@@ y , elegant lifting of time and gravity .
it &apos;s as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be .
the qualification and du@@ st@@ unds of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in the Stream@@ ing about 13.00 Eastern Time ; which the men on Saturday , also at 13.00 .
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the ends as part of an afternoon blocks on 2 days from 14.00 .
in the midst of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ie , they promise a quiet , nice moment , one which will probably over@@ look in the general tum@@ ult .
if the raising of consciousness can only be achieved through the Ang@@ affen and the object of male ath@@ l@@ ete - like it sm@@ ote the male U.S. gymn@@ asts according to The Wall Street Journal recently - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey anticipated to rin@@ ding his right to air , new bann@@ ers .
&quot; a Generation prot@@ ested &quot; in Ethiopia , Long a allies of the US
non @-@ violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators that demand political changes in Ethiopia , sti@@ cking on violent resistance of the government .
witnesses say that zig prot@@ esting were killed during the cl@@ ashes with the police at Sch@@ uss@@ ing .
is Ethiopia just to break together ?
in the last ten years it was one of the most stable countries of Africa , a solid bond of West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in the last months protests against the government , sh@@ aken the country and extended into more and more areas .
last week thousands of people stor@@ my streets and requested fundamental political changes .
the response of the government was un@@ mer@@ ci@@ ful according to human rights organisations .
witnesses said that polic@@ emen were shot at zig un@@ armed prot@@ esters and killed .
emerging videos about the protests , which are probably from last or beginning of this year , how security professionals show young people with staves , while these were forced to make a stand against a wall .
the leader of the UN High Authority on Human Rights is now required by an in@@ coming study .
&quot; it has always been difficult to hold this country and will become even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the horn of Africa of the International Cris@@ is Group , a research group .
Ethiopia is a most pop@@ ulated country of Africa and its stability is este@@ emed by the West .
American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terrorism across the region , especially in Somalia . only few countries in Africa , if at all , receive so much Western help .
Ethiop@@ ian Economy is expanding at a considerable pace .
his infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new p@@ endant in the capital Ad@@ dis Abe@@ ba .
the roads are generally quiet , safe and clean .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if Ethiopia has been anything but a role model for democracy - human rights organizations are continuing the repres@@ sion through the government - the opposition in the country became restricted , whereby dis@@ si@@ dents were effectively addressed to silence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many have been sent into exile or prison , killed or pushed into the desert of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; if you supp@@ ress people and these no other options have out except to protest , it breaks off , &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a l@@ ecturer in central Ethiop@@ ian .
the entire youth prot@@ ested .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from the ground up to the stran@@ gling in relation to the power of the ruling coalition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a widespread election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , the tensions alongside the border to Er@@ it@@ rea ; a struggle for this z@@ ack@@ able , contro@@ versi@@ al line requested in June hundreds of life .
an@@ alysts are fear@@ ed that the separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the Cor@@ mo @-@ Liber@@ ation Front or the National Coordin@@ ation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , which have been imposed more or less imposed in recent years , the tur@@ mo@@ il and can be re@@ armed .
several factors explain why feelings of the bit@@ tern@@ ess after years of exposure to the surface can now explo@@ de .
the first seems to be harm@@ less : smartphones .
only in recent years have been very many Ethiopia in a position to communicate with social media since more cheap smartphones have been more common and the Internet services improved .
even if the government does access to Facebook and Twitter , what they are in regular intervals , mainly in protests , doing so many people can still communicate via internet pro@@ x@@ ies , which conce@@ al where they are staying .
several young Ethiop@@ ians passed that they gathered so to protest .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ as in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
since Ä@@ ons prosp@@ eri@@ fied the ministers of Am@@ har@@ as , who come from Ethiopia mainly Christian civili@@ z@@ ations , in the politics and the economy , while they explo@@ it the Oro@@ mos , many of whom are Muslims and living in flat @-@ lands .
but also this is changing just .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are here to coordinate with a shield , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the biggest protests found in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray that domin@@ ates around 6 percent of the population and which are dominant in the military , in the intelligence services , trade and politics .
the third reason for un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former re@@ bel leader , was until his death on a non @-@ profit disease in the year 2012 17 years of Ethiopia .
he was regarded as tac@@ tical geni@@ us , a man who could think of corners .
an@@ alysts agree that he was particularly ver@@ sion@@ ed to perceive early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and to use special contrac@@ tor to edit opponents and make them un@@ harmful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime is lacking in this fundamental skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict of conflict . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia New Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen relatively un@@ clear reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray Region of the North of Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south .
an@@ alysts agree that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services provided by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blo@@ od@@ shed .
the last time that Ethiopia had lived such a mo@@ il in 2005 , after thousands of elections prot@@ ested that according to the information of analy@@ st were seem@@ ingly decei@@ ved by the government and were st@@ olen .
during the following swe@@ eps , many prot@@ esti@@ vities were killed , even if there were less than in the last months and this time of un@@ rest was relatively quickly over .
development of Ethiopia are the leaders for their vision@@ ary infra@@ structural planning , like the new p@@ endant train , as well as for their meas@@ urable progress in poverty ab@@ at@@ ement .
but evi@@ d@@ ently this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal mis@@ ha@@ un@@ st of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
the last month of the prot@@ esti@@ vities in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ ian city , of Tig@@ ray guided shops and the hat@@ red over the tig@@ ray becomes more and more ex@@ tri@@ mental in the social media .
an@@ alysts agree that the protests of the US and other Western allies turn into a peculi@@ ar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as a basis for Dr@@ on@@ en@@ trips over the neigh@@ bou@@ red Somalia , even though they recently settled , that it has closed this base .
while the West wants to support democracy , he does not want his allies in an already vol@@ ati@@ le area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin track . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his claim , Obama has founded IS@@ IS was &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to disp@@ el the final contro@@ vers@@ y on Friday the last contro@@ vers@@ y sur@@ faced his campaign , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would have been the &quot; Fo@@ under of Islamic State , not seriously .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this clari@@ fications cast new questions to the communication capabilities of the presidential system of Republi@@ cans whether he is able to communicate clearly and understandable with the American public . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also brings its contribut@@ ors who want to take him during an event@@ ful phase in protection , to explain in the peculi@@ ar position , which he could not have been meant to be .
after having made the clear@@ ing event in an elect@@ oral event on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump was back on Thursday and consi@@ sted in interviews on that he really did not intend to indicate the president and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS .
but in an early flat twe@@ et on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump , he is simply sar@@ cas@@ tically .
the twe@@ et was the contrast to the previous day when Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he said the acc@@ us@@ ation perfectly seriously .
when the conserv@@ ative radi@@ om@@ o@@ der@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump would help to dimin@@ ish this statement by doing it remin@@ ded that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS wanted to know nothing of it .
the last storm of critic@@ isms pointed to Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he tried to guide the focus of his campaign because of falling surveys on the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton kept speeches for the economic situation in Michigan this week .
on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this topic .
through Twitter , he war@@ ned that Mrs. Clin@@ tons would have suggestions to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already passed sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
at the end of July he passed strong criticism of himself when he said , the Russians should h@@ ack Mrs. Clin@@ tons of emails , but later he said , &quot; Nat@@ ür@@ lich &quot; said the sar@@ cas@@ tically . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to shift the language boundaries in politics and then return to v@@ eins .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of its methods to test how certain messages of his fans will be recorded as they arrive , and then if necessary , &quot; according to how the reaction falls . &quot; said Ruth Dallas , a communications approach , which observed the language of both candidates .
but I also think he is clever enough to keep his information v@@ ague enough so that they can be interpreted in a variety of ways .
instead of shar@@ pen@@ ing the sound for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has an even estim@@ able note , since its surveys have further declined .
a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist who was published on Friday showed a guided tour with great lead in the federal states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
during Mr. Tr@@ ump in general , he is not trying to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ al statements , he acc@@ ult@@ ed his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or to understand his hum@@ our .
but while he is strengthening the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ umps Scher@@ ze has brought his loyal fellow wh@@ ites to the un@@ convenient situation , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ant his statements also may be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former Mayor of New York and one of the most prominent teachers , gave himself great difficulty to defend the candidates today in an CN@@ N interview on Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says are legi@@ timate , political comments &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani he was asked to the correctness of Mr. Tr@@ umps statements whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense that Obama IS@@ IS was almost unknown , small organization , he called them back @-@ dar@@ ker , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he moved the troops from Iraq .
most mainstre@@ am re@@ public@@ ans try to ar@@ gue that the government served under Obama as the Foreign Minister , it was IS@@ IS allowed to spread themselves to spread the situation in the Middle East aggressive under control .
before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and cast them before , on each of his words , and against him were pres@@ t .
he mis@@ understood the &quot; poor , j@@ äm@@ mer@@ able &quot; TV expert , who try to understand and said , &quot; You Can &apos;t ! &quot;
some of the democr@@ ats pointed out over Mr. Tr@@ umps exc@@ use than just another proof that he may be un@@ suitable for the presidential Office .
once over the price negoti@@ ated from the market , Café is back to green@@ point
Ver@@ b Cafe was a sh@@ ash@@ y café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi , but for 15 years good coffee was served .
naturally , by prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ en@@ Front
the shop So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , replaced the ver@@ b in the summer of 2014 , sold so@@ ap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
indigenous people saw it as the last loss in a false @-@ sized city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ alle wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I can still not believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and ver@@ b is now a so@@ ap business . &quot;
but if New York Change is , it is also a new feeling .
a revi@@ ved ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similar atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long@@ time employee of the ancient cafes , the owner and managing director of the new cafes .
he began working in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
when offering him a customer to provide money for a new out@@ post , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , ordered a lot at .
ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the Bag@@ els bought the same es@@ pres@@ ent@@ ine model .
it even uses the same bulbs from the old ver@@ b .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he also wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wich@@ es with bac@@ on and che@@ eses and there are Gar@@ ni@@ ers such as cap@@ ers and acid oni@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is natural &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bow@@ ls &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the café serves no beer more , for this there are fresh ju@@ ices .
after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he noticed a steady stream of old tri@@ bal customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old customers were also pushed back by prices of Willi@@ am@@ sburg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oliveira about such a customer .
Oliveira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg and visited the ver@@ b regularly .
even after she moved to green@@ point she would take the way up .
after the ver@@ b had closed , she gave a while the coffee maker , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was clear that it was on the coffee and on the culture in the ver@@ b that came to me &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now they drink it again coffee , even if they presented a Bl@@ ended C@@ ome Tea in place instead of their usual I@@ ced coff@@ ees , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been another long@@ standing and loyal customer since the beginning of the verse in 2003 .
he went there before the work and was inev@@ it@@ ably still D@@ ame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came home after seven , every day , like a Swiss Pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing dre@@ el with butter ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and start new ingredients in the menu .
nowadays Ros@@ enthal gets still its usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing dre@@ el with bac@@ on , be@@ aten egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he had no gro@@ ll that he had taken the so@@ ap of the old business room .
in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie remin@@ ded a special so@@ ap for ver@@ b with the cold b@@ lowing coffee of the café as an ingre@@ dient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will come down in their offering , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional , Polish people Green@@ points have also accepted the café as well .
a new customer has translated the menu &apos;s menu to Poland and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he will be able to exp@@ ose them soon , so that its new neighb@@ ors will feel welcome .
the site also has further advantages .
a local Saf@@ t@@ room would like to fill the cold @-@ b@@ aked coffee into bottles and sell .
there is a chance that the café is expanding on a nearby building .
for many customers a new ver@@ b is enough to get their old favorites .
Joseph W@@ itt was Chief Apostle and said that he was destroyed at the floor than the café closed .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ ich said wh@@ itt said that the bed of the restaurant and the bri@@ cks felt a new coffee like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had to sm@@ ells , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; an abundant meal &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his ascent to the president , Franklin Del@@ ano Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt took his lunch in the O@@ val Office .
as gour@@ mets , President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt had a Fai@@ ble for refined Del@@ ik@@ at@@ essen the Fi@@ fth Avenue such as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland water@@ tor@@ tie soup .
its menu on that day was a bit mod@@ est : co@@ red eggs in Tom@@ at@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , m@@ ashed Pot@@ atoes and as dessert a pl@@ ums .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with the people , &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man .
her husband , Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; There was also a message to the Americans like they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both groc@@ eries .
Co@@ es &apos;s book &quot; Ch@@ op Su@@ ey , &quot; acted from Chinese cuisine in the USA , while Zi@@ egel@@ man tells in her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; about living in a residential house at the Lower East Side from the food perspective .
your latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at the Har@@ per Verlag , illustrated the history of American cuisine while the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a re@@ por@@ ter at the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , snow@@ k@@ ell@@ os@@ em Im@@ bis@@ s at the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market in 1929 .
Zi@@ egel@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh me@@ es@@ and@@ wich with olive piece , while co@@ e , 57 , Tru@@ th@@ ahn with pot@@ ato p@@ ashed and vegetable @-@ sink .
as the Rep@@ or@@ ter Hack@@ bar@@ ata , this found the pair for a discussion about the food during the era of the Great Depression .
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; said L@@ egel@@ man .
there were Erd@@ n@@ uss@@ bro@@ t , liver cheese and Bohn@@ en@@ bro@@ t .
they were made up of an ingre@@ dient and a little Bil@@ lig@@ em which stretches the ingre@@ dient .
imagine so many pe@@ anu@@ ts to eat that they serve them as a dinner .
co@@ on gr@@ ins .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have placed in the stomach like Ble@@ i , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the years before the Great Depression , the table was placed in an American household , especially in rural areas , an All @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at @-@ buffet .
teams of women co@@ asts for male pers@@ u@@ ters and it became fresh@@ ly b@@ aked past@@ el for breakfast , lunch and dinner served .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was the Americans who sent food during the First World War to star@@ ving Europeans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A Square &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stands out the paths that the country went with it , no longer the sh@@ ar@@ ming of the land . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when eating for the Americans was a central , ten@@ se theme , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; made fo@@ e why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just as ten@@ se the new Bud@@ dy was the new Bud@@ get@@ di@@ p : mysterious food like bread and cas@@ ser@@ ollen were too stap@@ le food , the Kas@@ ser@@ ol@@ le as a &quot; wonderful nature , eating rest &quot; , mer@@ ged Zi@@ egel@@ man , since coo@@ ks un@@ appe@@ tit@@ ate ingredients under a cre@@ am@@ y sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by billi@@ ger@@ es dry ground .
me@@ ats , which was for years the center of the American cuisine , became a rare luxury .
peculi@@ arities were tried , since a cal@@ orie @-@ rich and nour@@ ishing satisfaction has priority before taste or even healthy diet .
during her research for the book , which includes recipes , prepared Zi@@ egel@@ man a court from this era , curved oni@@ ons with pe@@ anu@@ t butter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was no popular promise on lunch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zi@@ egel@@ man continues on : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ anu@@ t butter and b@@ ici@@ oni@@ ons are not fit to each other .
it was typical for many of the household recipes .
as never before or since then , the bud@@ get@@ ary economy - including Louise Stan@@ ley , Leit@@ ress of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 up to 1943 - the eating habits of the country such .
as published recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; bud@@ get@@ ary &quot; servants and the challenge to transform r@@ amp like cre@@ m@@ ly sp@@ aghetti with car@@ r@@ ots into delicious meals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a celebration of historic ti@@ d@@ bits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in particular , the reports about the response of the government to star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ vers L@@ ass @-@ cakes @-@ food @-@ food .
while he publicly pra@@ ised the simple I@@ owa farm@@ ac@@ ce of his kitchen , he sp@@ ill like the milli@@ on@@ ous man from the world to which he has become .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ate in a almost contam@@ inated ice @-@ room and contributed a smo@@ king .
he was delightful real@@ ism .
President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt may have argu@@ ed the same mistake when not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or asked him to stat@@ ute him with his stomach .
as described in the book , the leader of a good@@ will with no interest in flavors by Ms Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt , that the White House brought the bo@@ red food in Washington but also one of the most contro@@ versi@@ es . &quot;
many of the species from the era of the Great Depression , deal with food , was rejected once the country got back on the legs .
the legacy is our continued focus on cal@@ ories and food , said Zi@@ egel@@ man , as well as on how science was applied to food .
the couple gave us better understood by writing the book the eating habits of Zi@@ egel@@ mans mother @-@ in @-@ law - for example as they couldn &apos;t throw food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it had a real fear of the wast@@ ing of food &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man remin@@ ded : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she made people really sick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the windsurfing .
once the plates at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s were clear@@ ed , they went and co@@ e a dessert that they had prepared at home : the p@@ egs , the president of Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt , had lunch .
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man and added that it was a di@@ m@@ able tri@@ ck , hum@@ ble recipes to send a name to miss .
there was no lag@@ ged cream , just pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and c@@ innamon .
everyone emerg@@ es somewhat lu@@ ct@@ ant a spo@@ on in the teeth , brown gli@@ b@@ bers .

he was the hero of Al@@ epp@@ o : K@@ hal@@ ed Om@@ ar devoted his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ky everything in order to save others .
now , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old himself died at a fac@@ bom@@ b attack of the Assad &apos;s regime .
Om@@ ar was a member of the &quot; White helmet , &quot; a civilian group , which has saved the life according to Bild @-@ Newspaper .
29@@ 00 Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers put her own lives in the game to pull people out of broken homes and to afford first aid in the war .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
Om@@ ar was the face of the group : a video of the civil player , which shows it in a 11 @-@ hour rescue of a inf@@ ant from the rub@@ ble of a house , went to the world in 2014 .
it made the Sy@@ rer to the shining symbol@@ ism in the Gre@@ ys of the war .

Gre@@ enland : the oldest sp@@ ine is nearly 400 years old
rare sight .
Gre@@ enland experience usually only in winter to surface .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return after an examination on board the schi@@ z@@ ship S@@ anna into the sea .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a good 1 km / h through Nor@@ dat@@ lan@@ tik - until today .
Gr@@ ön@@ land @-@ hair@@ s get a young discount at the age of 150 years .
in the average flo@@ wery of the Gre@@ enland ground at the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour he goes on average th@@ under@@ ne@@ 220 meters far .
only when it comes down , the five meters long animal acceler@@ ates at sat@@ te 2,6 km / h - and is half as fast as a Rob@@ be .
this kind of lon@@ eliness lifestyle does not seem to be a god@@ parent for a high age .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the Fach@@ zeit@@ schrift ( Science &quot; ) of a Gre@@ enland , the 392 year old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mad@@ ness &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; commented Alexander Sch@@ eu@@ erl@@ ein vom Max @-@ Plan@@ ck @-@ Institut für demo@@ graphic Research in Rostock this category @-@ span , which means for wh@@ ales a world record . &quot; &quot; &quot;
indeed , the evolutionary bi@@ ologist already long that Gre@@ enland is rock @-@ old .
only lack@@ ed the evidence .
Gr@@ ön@@ land ha@@ ie are difficult to observe , eventually they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the thin coast from Canada , Gre@@ enland , Norway and Spit@@ s@@ bergen .
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they mostly appear on the surface mostly in winter .
about the lifestyle of Gre@@ enland researchers know accordingly little .
your time @-@ pent@@ agon@@ o corn star@@ ters them , when they hide six animals with a transmitter .
boot@@ y , this shar@@ ks still make : in the stomach of a beast , researchers found the remains of a Rob@@ be , another had s@@ wal@@ low@@ ed the p@@ endant of a young sk@@ ov@@ ary .
possibly chase them sleeping animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the ic@@ me@@ eres and are looking for Kad@@ asses , which stem from higher water layers down .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues now examined 28 Gre@@ enland , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 from Gre@@ enland or S@@ val@@ bard as the catch of the depth of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cm long , while the largest 5@@ 02 cen@@ tim@@ eters .
to assess the age of the animals , analysed them with the carbon @-@ 14 method the lens of shar@@ ks .
this centre of the ey@@ e@@ ey@@ elet has already been created before the birth of the ha@@ ie , that the proteins are later no longer re@@ done .
the two smallest shar@@ ks had been stri@@ k@@ ingly much carbon @-@ 14 in the lens .
your birth should therefore lie after the early 19@@ 60s as nuclear @-@ consuming large amounts of this radi@@ o@@ active carbon into the atmosphere .
in the length of 220 cen@@ tim@@ eters , the third smallest animal sheds light on the other hand a low over@@ shot of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapon @-@ 14 , it is likely to have celebrated his 50@@ th birthday in 2012 with its investigation in 2012 .
all larger Gr@@ ön@@ land had in its lens with the normal carbon @-@ 14 quantities which arises from cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
actually the Carbon @-@ 14 @-@ watch was shown for a 4@@ 93 cen@@ tim@@ eters long Gre@@ enland an age of 335 years , while the record @-@ shar@@ k with 5@@ 02 cen@@ tim@@ eters even 392 years old might be .
that Gre@@ enland females only then get off@@ spring when they are longer than four meters was known .
now the researchers of the length could classi@@ fy an age .
since one of the animals with 392 cen@@ tim@@ eters well was probably on the thres@@ hold to the sexual ri@@ pe and his age with 156 years was determined , Gr@@ ön@@ land @-@ hat@@ y with the multip@@ ly obviously at least one @-@ half centuries time .
also this is likely to be a world record for wh@@ i@@ ri@@ ots .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme live above all in e@@ isi@@ gen waters is no coinci@@ dence .
also the previous record holder , a 211 years old Gr@@ ön@@ land , in whose sp@@ eck at the neck , a 120 year old Har@@ ley @-@ pointed pro@@ ach , was imprison@@ ed before Alaska .
due to the low temperatures often the organism of the animals living there are also ri@@ de@@ fl@@ ames .
they attack then slowly - and s@@ lower .
in order to keep itself warm in cold water , the animals are often particularly large .
because the volume grows much faster than its surface , by which the animal gets heat .
the heat loss from one gram mouse is therefore much greater than in one gram of an El@@ eph@@ ant .
an additional advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a lesser animal lives in hazardous areas and should focus on focusing on as many descendants as possible as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explains the evolutionary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ eu@@ erl@@ ein . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , a very large animal should invest more in a long life on it .
construction of the double @-@ pack
with topics around the construction , the community at the youngest meeting has focused mainly in the recent meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with relief the Panel took the release of Mayor Robert P@@ utz , that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , the marketing of the younger population can start out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the real estate , par@@ zel@@ li@@ erungs@@ - and Occup@@ ational issues were clari@@ fied and the applications were provided in the living area &quot; street l@@ weg &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( section Bin@@ der@@ straße - Aus@@ bau@@ ab@@ schnitt 1 ) to seek@@ ers nothing more in the way .
the community is convinced that the B@@ auf@@ l@@ aken in rural emb@@ oss@@ ed and quiet urban@@ ization , Schön@@ au young families and medi@@ ums equally appealing .
as it says , construction will@@ fully can report immediately at the City Hall via the award of par@@ c@@ els is expected to consult in its September meeting .

Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
the city at the Main has ended in the contest with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg the best opportunities to move from London jobs and companies .
&quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt am benef@@ ited from Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the competence field and property markets of the I@@ W .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is un@@ certain whether the farm@@ houses continue to operate from London from financial transactions in the entire EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the so @-@ called EU @-@ Pass it is far enough for registration in the UK .
this is just a big US banking .
several banks have already announced to shift jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lob@@ b@@ union &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expects of 10000 new jobs at the Main in five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the headquarters of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision on the largest banks in the euro zone , as well as further important authorities such as the European insurance company EI@@ O@@ PA and the risk of business ES@@ RB .
in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) is head@@ quar@@ tered , but it is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the note is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luxembourg shel@@ ving a large fund industry , but also like Dublin in the infrastructure at the same time .
Frankfurt was clearly easier to reach thanks to the large airport .
further points the city with easily available commercial properties .
&quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free high quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder .
at the Seine , we also prepare for first @-@ class business properties around 50 per cent higher than the Main .
furthermore , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition , thanks to good medical care and infrastructure , as well as less crimin@@ ality .
in a ranking of corporate consultancy , Merc@@ er stand the city on place seven , Luxembourg to place 19 , Dublin in place 33 and Paris at 3@@ 8. place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if quality of life may be a question of anticip@@ ation : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a financial location for the European Single Market , Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as opposed the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but London will remain the most important financial center in Europe despite Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mean the economic crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this reason , the forces of power relations work in London also worked out according to numbers from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba at the end of 2015 around 14@@ 4000 people in the banking sector , in Frankfurt , there were 6@@ 2500 .

clin@@ tons earn 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 34,@@ 2 % federal taxes
Hill@@ ary Clinton published their tax return in 2015 on Friday made its tax return for the presidential and her husband an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective Federal tax of 34,@@ 2 % .
in 2015 , the Clin@@ tons of USD 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; the former president Bill Clinton had almost USD 5,@@ 3 million in Re@@ de@@ hon@@ orary ; the former Secretary of State gave an income of USD 3 million by Verlag Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for her book on her office in the State Department .
Clin@@ tons Can@@ did@@ at for the Vice President , Sen@@ ator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published along with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton his tax statements of the last ten years .
you paid a effective Bundes@@ tax by 20,@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to put standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave Clin@@ tons Kamp@@ agn@@ en@@ hel@@ fer@@ in Jenni@@ fer Pal@@ mi@@ eri in an opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a stark contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump is hidden behind f@@ avo@@ idance and pull @-@ out regarding his current promises to publish its tax statements .
it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax statements , although it is not oblig@@ ated by law because of this .
Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his law@@ yers have stated as the reason for its den@@ ial , a tax check by the tax authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are on the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Clin@@ tons of elect@@ oral campaign in Ian S@@ ams on Twitter , regarding the publication of the presidential and Democrats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday Michael C@@ oh@@ en , Tr@@ umps Special consultants , to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish something before the tax checks are not completed .
tr@@ umps critic@@ isms , among other things the Republi@@ can presidential and did@@ at of the year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already susp@@ ected that his exc@@ use issues related to assets , his donations for char@@ itable organisations , his business coll@@ ars , and various other connections arise , in particular with Russia .
Clinton had already over@@ thrown on the issue and published on Friday a video posted on the internet , in the high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tr@@ ump to publish its tax return .
on Thursday she spoke the issue also during a speech given to the economy in Michigan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ref@@ used to do what has done every other presidential candidate in recent decades and to publish its tax statements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Poli@@ tico has reported that Tr@@ ump during the 1990s did not pay for two years or only very little taxes , and an economic journalist of the New York Times c@@ ited on Friday a number of tax affairs and tax consultants , the data that could still be the case .
federal control must become a theme in the elect@@ oral campaign .
Clinton supports a regulation that would be named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and Investor War@@ ren Buff@@ y that would ensure that people earn more than USD 1 million a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama supports the proposal also .
during an election event for Hill@@ ary Clinton in the past week in Omaha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka requested Buff@@ y , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away Industri@@ er@@ gl@@ omer@@ ate has its headquarters to exchange a meeting on their tax statements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Buff@@ y said , he was also subj@@ ected to a tax study of I@@ RS and Tr@@ ump has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before voters and not before tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ tons campaign launched tax return trips back to 2007 .
the Clin@@ ics , which now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid for an effective tax rate of approx . 32 % between the years 2007 to 2014 and an effective tax rate of approx . 40,@@ 5 % .
the tax return of the Clin@@ tons of 2015 showed that only USD 100 of their income is worth wages , unlike the bulk of all Americans .
their main @-@ major v@@ ector was a cost @-@ effective Index@@ Fund , from which the Clin@@ tons divi@@ den@@ ds and proceeds from USD 10@@ 9,@@ 000 .

Jewish director , Berliner Hotel , because Israeli pre@@ selection has been removed after &quot; Arabian &quot; call - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media resolution , after having betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin has listed no Israeli pre@@ election , as the Arabic guests had called according to one employee . &quot;
Claude Lan@@ z@@ mann , author of the Hol@@ oc@@ au@@ st@@ Docum@@ entation &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; led his trouble at the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by wrote an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay Lan@@ z@@ mann tried to find Israel on the site of the hotel .
however , the country was not listed among the countries which can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room .
how is it in the year 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel is eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lan@@ z@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol has an opportunity to choose Israel across a separate call center .
after an explanation he turned the director to the Hotel &apos;s reception .
the answer he received there , &quot; scho@@ cked him , &quot; wie Lan@@ z@@ mann wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel shown that the measure was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sec@@ lu@@ ded decision of the Kemp@@ inski Hotels &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind it stood , ext@@ ingu@@ ished in the director or more anger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election will be deleted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the given by Lan@@ z@@ mann &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Israeli amb@@ assador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov h@@ adas @-@ commerce called this a &quot; great shame &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; reported the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung reports . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were de@@ sto@@ cked by this event and trou@@ bled .
this is really very embarrass@@ ing .
the fact that this in Germany has borne the fact that this hotel chain has even greater shame .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right conclusions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident ext@@ ingu@@ ished a fairly large reson@@ ance on the Internet where people called the whole sc@@ andal .
some signed the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it had been given the aff@@ o@@ rest@@ ations of the Arabian guests . &quot;
&quot; shame you , &quot; called it in another post , in which it was pointed out that the hotel that is located at the cl@@ assy Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , near a synagogue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly pointed out any acc@@ us@@ ations of themselves and called the incident to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; break &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; ap@@ olog@@ ised &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Lan@@ z@@ mann , reported the mirror . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct statement , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Israel was not included in the quick@@ stop list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted the South German newspapers a spok@@ es@@ man of the Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot; &quot; &quot;

trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly increases to 71 % to RT business
with the lifting of the sanctions , according to the Russian Ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ in D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trade turnover of Moscow and Teheran , in the year equal to 7@@ 0.9 percent .
since the international sanctions against Iran were lifted , the interest in the Russian company in stores in the country has strengthened the amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors .
Russian companies take existing connections to Iran , while new companies are ready to access the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; naturally , the further merch@@ ant is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he mer@@ ged that the trade approach between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 was increased by 7@@ 0.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular the Russian imports in Iran grew by 9@@ 1.5 percent br@@ ushing and bet@@ ru@@ ed $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
the trade swing was achieved by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors .
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan dates from a record of Iranian tourists in Russia for this year .
last year , Russian foreign representatives were around 3@@ 5.000 VIS@@ AS , primarily in the first place of Reis@@ ev@@ is@@ as , an Iranian citizen .
furthermore , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries , which concerns the economy of tourists in Russia .
one could say that the record @-@ paid tourists in Russia last year , broken , &quot; he said .
at the same time only relatively few Russians den Iran , something , of which the amb@@ assador hopes that it will change .
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the towns of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ raz and Y@@ az@@ d , who received the monuments of the old Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said .

Sch@@ otte Call@@ um Sk@@ inner stor@@ ms home , as Br@@ ite Gold for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ back Sk@@ inner ra@@ ste last night in the tra@@ p team member in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio to glory , when the British Team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the an@@ ker@@ chief who had made his Land@@ s@@ mann Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made his leg@@ end and made the leg@@ end proud of having left a victory from the favourites New Zealand .
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory in four years ago , while Ho@@ y got the fifth of six Olympi@@ ag@@ old@@ med@@ a@@ ill .
she reiter@@ ated the trick , after they took place in March at the World Championships in London , despite the retreat Ho@@ ys , only a mod@@ est sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver &apos;s Jam@@ ie Staff .
they did so in time as a reminder .
Ho@@ ys retirement created a gap , the Ki@@ an Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ amp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man , where they remained , when they saw the potential in the vill@@ i that has now un@@ folded .
Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - die before four years with Ho@@ y vic@@ tori@@ ous - and Sk@@ inner sat in the Quali@@ fication round an Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ord , but in the Stand@@ ar@@ dr@@ um@@ bers won the New Zeal@@ ander in the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
Hin@@ des was shortly after his turn , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and scr@@ inner held it .
a strategic change made a big part of the transformation , in the execution of a higher gear to slow it down and there are Kenn@@ y and above all sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y looked from his position as the BBC expert and fell to Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des , than those on the pe@@ destal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year skiing from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am just here to do my best and to make myself a name .
we have placed in the En@@ dr@@ unde an Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ord and defe@@ ated the World Champion .
it was just amazing .
there is no better way to win this .
after the tri@@ umph of 2012 at the page Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys gave Hin@@ des that he conf@@ isc@@ ated after a weak start .
he returned this statement later and there was no obj@@ ection of England Rival .
in such a great victory this time there was no such problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels with all the GB flags on the ble@@ ach@@ ers like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together as a team for the last three months .
we came so badly from so many world titles so that it was incredible to win back at the Olympi@@ ad .
this is an event , a gold med@@ al for the nation , which were obtained seven of 10 titles both in Beijing and London .
if this is a bar@@ ometer for our advancement within the last five months , we are expecting successful five days in the Vel@@ od@@ rom .
with the form of passwords it is in the area of possible that he ho@@ y victory of three ol@@ ym@@ p@@ ic gol@@ fers in a contest repeated .
this would be for Kenn@@ y - the exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23 ( a apparently sacred date for British sports ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster was born ) - a pre@@ y of six gold medals and a silver med@@ al .
the stor@@ ms of the testi@@ cles are the same .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the Sprint coming today and will go over three days .
the 28 @-@ year @-@ old of Bol@@ ton said : &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always at best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a little lon@@ ely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two other gold medals , he should be be@@ aten to the Knight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only med@@ alli@@ ances of the day but there were further good news for England .
Sir Br@@ adly Wig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified himself with the fastest performance in the four @-@ four kilometers .
you arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 at the destination .
the World record , which was in 2012 in London , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of competition , Wig@@ gins is certainly in focus .
he had fought yesterday with bel@@ lied before the qualification , as him function@@ aries to measure his body size .
in the corresponding project competition , the morning continued and ended , av@@ anci@@ ed Laura Tr@@ ott , Jo@@ anna Riv@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie Archi@@ soon of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ av@@ ie in World record time in 4 : 13.@@ 260 .
the GB team re@@ lies on its strong rail network , to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to get a sh@@ ar of medals .
after a truly extraordinary representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio to be shut down .
it played Dr@@ amas in the background , so the withdrawal of the technical leader Sh@@ ane Sut@@ ton in April in the midst of Sex@@ ismus@@ - and Mob@@ b@@ ing@@ vor@@ alties , as well as retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria P@@ end@@ let@@ on .
however , if one sees the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks quite later than that the now legendary call GB@@ S , who has reached the perfect moment its peak , again repeated .
future of mel@@ ting from Port@@ land due to the lifting of the energy sector
the future of the aluminium sl@@ um@@ bling of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundred @-@ hundred jobs of workers - are at stake , as the plant operators can cancel the energy supplier and thereby res@@ ist all supply agreements as the under@@ ing energy companies .
this step was followed by the decision of the government at Victoria in the beginning of this year , no further subsi@@ dies to operate the plant .
one for 20 years in the event of subsi@@ dy is running in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the plant of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land stand on the game .
no less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect so@@ - could be at a closing time .
in addition , it could occur to Dom@@ ino@@ effective , as the mel@@ ting were consumed around 10 percent of the total electricity generation Victori@@ as .
2014 closed the Point Henry Schmel@@ z@@ ei , which led the last year to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power station .
the mel@@ ting of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and ris@@ ky a closing .
this step follows the years of spec@@ ulation in terms of the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Austr@@ al@@ ous dollar and last due to the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which provides the large aluminium ch@@ mel@@ ted with its Lo@@ y Yang A Kraft@@ werk in Lat@@ robe Valley , shared with that there are three other owners announce their contracts .
the complex is mainly owned by Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina in which the Chinese companies CI@@ TI@@ C and the Japanese Mar@@ u@@ ben@@ i Cor@@ p smaller shar@@ ehol@@ dings .
&quot; AG@@ L is assum@@ ing that the plant is still operated in Port@@ land , which means a further physical demand for electricity through the mel@@ ting &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; divided the company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L also said that the contracts called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; backup &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will have to come into force from November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contracts have a 12 @-@ month period of cancellation , so that it will end 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from that , AG@@ L from that the contracts in the fiscal year will contribute to the income , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impact on income at AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by forecasts of strong termin@@ ology markets for major retail prices .
AG@@ L shared with that it already subs@@ cribed to the value of contracts entered at the amount of $ 187 million in &quot; expect@@ ation of a cancellation . &quot;
Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; ability Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the melt temperature or to guarantee the power supply to the mel@@ ting .
the U.S. company said that 2010 has concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , who would have come into effect from November this year , even if it is still a statement that it has come back from the contract .
analy@@ st war@@ n due to the poor economic relations of the industry before the possible closure of the Port@@ land mel@@ ting in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago system near New@@ castle .
in reference to the statements of the Analy@@ tic beginning of the week , the head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen was that Port@@ land consume around 600 meg@@ aw@@ at@@ ts and Tom@@ ago around 900 meg@@ aw@@ at@@ ts in electricity .
if both plants disappear from the market , it would mean considerable decrease in demand on the &#91; current market &#93; .
and for us as a generator it would not be good , &quot; he said .
more than just a car@@ das@@ hi@@ an Re@@ ality @-@ TV @-@ Star , Kendall is on the Cover from Sept@@ ember@@ ment of the Vo@@ gue
Kendall , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ j@@ enner c@@ lan@@ s Kr@@ is is located on the cover of the cov@@ eted Sept@@ ember@@ ment of the US Vo@@ gue .
Kendall , the embl@@ em of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der is and ran into the fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on their Inst@@ agram account .
&quot; in a room full of people I love , brought me to the sight of this Co@@ vers to tears . &quot;
the un@@ veil@@ ing of the Co@@ vers followed a bizar@@ re ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Car@@ th@@ hi@@ an &apos;s similar ? ) , sc@@ ented carbide video , which is the whole Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Un@@ cle and producer of Ke@@ ep Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , as it ends the cover of her sister and ends with a classic extension : they have all planned a surprise party .
this presents the kl@@ ee@@ ee@@ gently plot almost every birth@@ days of a children &apos;s return ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; Du dach@@ ing that we could forget you ? &apos; , with the honest@@ y of a sign on a station at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kr@@ is had to participate her other girls somehow at this publicity .
with regard to the Sept@@ ember@@ ment of the Vo@@ gue , certainly has begun a new era of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans .
Kend@@ ray big sister Kim likes it what the preference has be@@ aten ( her and her husband Kan@@ ye West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the Sept@@ ember@@ ment of the magazine is a le@@ ague for themselves .
the Sept@@ ember@@ ment is the most dep@@ uty edition of the year for Vo@@ gue .
with a circum@@ ference , which resem@@ bles an image band as a fashion magazine , the output draws a large number of advertis@@ ers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ oni@@ sta were operated by the 8@@ 32 pages of rolling bearing 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) .
the un@@ veil@@ ing of his cover stars becomes so lon@@ ely expecting that in the last two years images of the magazine has been canc@@ eled before the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover , include Na@@ om@@ i Campbell , Linda Evangel@@ ist@@ a and Kate M@@ oss .
in recent years there were clearly more &quot; celeb@@ rities , the mod@@ ells &quot; than &quot; Mod@@ els , the celeb@@ rities are &quot; on the cover .
Oscar @-@ lau@@ rete and Di@@ or @-@ Mark@@ enb@@ ot@@ schaf@@ ot@@ opes Jenni@@ fer Lawrence was in 2013 at the cover , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
but even with the little chance that Ms. J@@ enner - described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of their generation - under the former category it falls , it is in good company .
these celeb@@ rities are not related to famous people or reality stars or you@@ ths today , who know how to get a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if everything depends on j@@ enner ) .
they are truly talented women who are reflected in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , which appeared on the last cover , had with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade , one of the most successful years of her career .
of course J@@ enn@@ ers does not like any success .
with her reality @-@ TV story J@@ enn@@ ers was always something ten@@ se in the fashion world .
in June he cri@@ tici@@ zed the pic@@ tured Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ model Steph@@ anie Se@@ ym@@ our j@@ enner , and her colleague Gig@@ i H@@ adi@@ d and called it &quot; the Mi@@ st@@ ems of the moment . &quot;
these feelings are again high , when the message with the show J@@ enn@@ ers appeared out on the Vo@@ gue Cover .
but on the scattered around the point appears at the point passing .
Kendall is on the cover of the sept@@ ember@@ ment of the vo@@ gue .
it is the tru@@ est sense of the word a super@@ model .
she runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
you and all your sisters will selling you pictures of their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
she s@@ ells out of her made pictures of Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds &apos;s daughter to the Bulletin .
and in their leisure time they can see in Re@@ ality TV . pres@@ um@@ ably just to see her sister ch@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
community centres yearly 16@@ 0,000 people per year
more than 16@@ 0,000 of the aid figures of the country are rejected each year by the community centres , while the sector has already made redund@@ ant on the impact of other medi@@ ations .
in Queens@@ land three of five people are already three of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , ne@@ edy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ true del@@ ays and similar ones - with their search for free legal couns@@ elling and legal advice .
legal services of the community , which are already over@@ priced , are ready for further cuts .
from June next year , it is fores@@ een that these juris@@ dictions will lose additional 30 percent of its allies .
the director of the municipal council of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last survey of the National Association of Community centers was revealed that thousands of people are being rejected each year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Far@@ rell said that the situation would only be made even worse without the termination of the resolution of the federal government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Queens@@ land community centres are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , which means thousands of people from important services that you need to be rejected , &quot; he said .
people who leave violent relations , people with un@@ man@@ age@@ able and op@@ pres@@ sive debt , families who were dism@@ iss@@ ed by divi@@ ders - all these people have problems a legal way and this survey shows that they do not receive the help they need .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the federal government will be cut by 30 percent from June 2017 , which means thousands of patients &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; must be comp@@ elled from Queens@@ land to be comp@@ elled with their legal problems without any help . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we call for the general alarm , and ordin@@ ators from Queens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to meet these medi@@ ations immediately , so people can get the help they need in legal problems .
last year , the state authorities filled their commitment to raise funds for legal assist@@ ants to the national average .
it is now time to look at the needs of the community centres and their customer communities as well as the government Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k is investing in this important work .

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey before the United Nations elections : SPD and CD@@ U
in the upcoming elections in federal Bundesländer Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) are significant losses for government @-@ party democr@@ ats and CD@@ U .
this was representative of the opinion of the Re@@ alisation of IN@@ SA for the &quot; Bild &quot; -@@ Zeitung ( Friday ) .
while the red @-@ black government co @-@ government in the north could not be ruled , this is not possible after the surveys in Berlin .
in both states the SPD would be the strongest party and therefore would have good opportunities to continue the re@@ forming .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD is followed by 35,@@ 6 percent in five years ago on 24 percent .
the party anno@@ ying with that according to survey only just before the CD@@ U that could come back to 23 percent .
the third place is contro@@ versi@@ al between the left and the African .
the left channel at 19 percent ( previously 18,@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be present with 19 percent for the first time in the land @-@ day .
in spite of easy losses with 6 percent ( previous 8.3 % ) in the Schwer@@ iner Land@@ tag .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not be represented by 3 percent in the country .
in the Berlin Chamber of de@@ pu@@ ties , the SPD in the survey was according to 23 percent ( election of 2011 : 28,@@ 3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U finished only 18 percent to 23.@@ 4 percent .
it is therefore still behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
Af@@ D would be present with 14 per cent for the first time in the de@@ pu@@ ties .
with 5 percent the F@@ DP could hope to return the pir@@ ates would be in contrast to 2011 in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
E @-@ mail and internet in time flights : 20 years ago , Nokia Communic@@ ator came to the market .
the successor to domin@@ ate the world today - his maker experienced a disaster .
the unit weigh@@ ed almost half k@@ ilo@@ grams and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was thick@@ er and bigger , therefore it was not good at hand .
on the contrary , it was quite chil@@ sty .
the built @-@ in memory was initially eight meg@@ ab@@ y@@ tes , which would be enough today for about two sel@@ fs with high resolution .
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gig@@ abyte .
the &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; arrived right 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , in the shops - and it was the first smartphone .
for a few euros , you can buy the devices still on the internet , but they somehow come from the con@@ ges@@ tion of the dormitory age .
20 years ago , however , the Communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer has announced the product a few months before on the C@@ eb@@ it &apos;s computer industry in Hannover as an &quot; office in the west format . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone was able to send and receive a lot of : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax was the communic@@ ator .
even access to websites has been possible via HTML browsers , even though qu@@ est@@ ingly slow .
a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital add@@ ress@@ book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be similar to a laptop .
then we found a small keyboard and a black @-@ white screen .
quite proud of the price : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , therefore about 1400 euros .
the average sales price of an smartphones in Germany was equivalent to 392 Euros .
nobody was able to susp@@ ect in August 1996 , that the Communic@@ ator of the beginning of the smartphone would be .
since then everything is different .
the clever phones are a success story , although not for Nokia .
the Handy @-@ Sp@@ arte the Finn@@ s experienced a un@@ preced@@ ented disaster , was finally sold and carried out in Microsoft .
the market today domin@@ ate suppliers that came all much later than Nokia .
being online and everywhere online , this is today too many people daily .
in 2015 there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide .
sold about 1.4 billion devices , based on Samsung and Apple alone , of which alone 555 million pieces were sold .
global sales with the devices is roughly 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ running shops of the numerous app @-@ providers and telecommunications companies .
around the smartphone is in the meantime an entire industry emerged .
the deciding breakthrough for the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007 , then announced Apple @-@ Chef Steve Jobs on the Mac World &apos;s introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones .
he spoke three devices in one : a music player , a phone and an Internet communication , all per touch screen easy to use .
the winner of the Apple began , nor today the iPhone is the most important product of the Group .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry which ruled the market had to see .
they finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
these s@@ ages have now Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is 20 years after its in@@ vention a self @-@ understanding .
in the cut , each German now looks for 88 times a day on his cell phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all have to learn to put the smartphone even time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina &apos;s ball , in the Siemens @-@ Board of Human Resources . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent availability is now regarded as a cur@@ se and blessing at the same time .
England must direct the ol@@ ym@@ p@@ ic spirit and bro@@ aden He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row is not only in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country renewal and prosperity .
for me , this was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ rows , just as at that time in 2012 in London , when we run a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benef@@ ited from the games .
the Olympi@@ ad brought great advantages for Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and this will again be achieved by creating new possibilities for location @-@ related companies and companies near to He@@ ath@@ row .
for our local communities we are already up to 10.000 new appren@@ tic@@ es@@ hips , 40,@@ 000 new jobs and youth unemployment in the airport environment .
just as they were ahead in London 2012 , there will be such that the challenge of expanding He@@ ath@@ rows is too great .
I have said that England will never be ready for the games and that we will bl@@ am@@ aze us on the world stage .
the dou@@ b@@ ans had 2012 and they are also mist@@ aken at He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to over@@ coming , but He@@ ath@@ row will answer any asked question .
like the Olympic Games is He@@ ath@@ row for many and not for individual a infra@@ structural project .
enlargement is a way to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion to open growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment both in order to leave the airport and in whole GB .
we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has been implemented in a £ 11 billion US investment program , from the T5 - the five year in a row to the world &apos;s best airport . to T2 , built in the middle of two frequ@@ ented paths of the world .
now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion to private investment .
the London games of 2012 were a great success for the UK and I am confident that the extension of He@@ ath@@ row will also be one .
it is time to direct this ol@@ ym@@ p@@ ic spirit and He@@ ath@@ row and create our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that can be proud of England .

on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block advertis@@ ings on his desktop page , published Ad@@ block Plus a blog post , in which it noted that users could update their filters in the program to again block advertising on social network .
on Tuesday Facebook shared with that his des@@ kt@@ op@@ page would change the coding for its advertis@@ ements , in order to detect it ad @-@ clear@@ ing the detection of any part of the page of advertising is to be difficult to detect .
but Ad@@ block pro@@ claim that it has found a new way to handle the new codes .
in a blog post , the spok@@ es@@ person wrote by Ad@@ block Ben Williams , that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ H@@ er has been ongoing since the in@@ vention of advertis@@ ers in progress &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook comes soon with a new solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that the world &apos;s largest company for social media has left into battle is a strong Indian indicator , as wor@@ rying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wor@@ rying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; industry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a study from the last year of Pag@@ ef@@ air and Adobe around 200 million people re@@ pro@@ lo@@ osen up ; almost four times as much 2013 .
with Pneumatic billions of active users who access Facebook via their mobile devices , Hand@@ y@@ wer@@ bung 84 percent of the ads are not@@ ebooks .
the company has shown this on display block @-@ block on desktop PCs , as mobile ad blocking does not have any effect on fac@@ ebook mobile app for the social network and inst@@ agram , shared a speaker with .
advertising on desktop PCs makes a sufficient proportion of revenue , so that Facebook appears to be the investment of such a step @-@ worth .
on Tuesday , Facebook shared that it would be &quot; advertising pre@@ dic@@ tion@@ tool &quot; to keep the people more control over them in targeted advertising .
on Thursday , Facebook , that Ad@@ hesi@@ on would be wor@@ rying , because they would also block content on the page , which are no advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the users that does not represent a positive experience , we plan to speak the problem &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; shared a speaker of Facebook in an e @-@ mail message . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Ms in susp@@ ected su@@ icide on Swiss motorway over@@ ride
the sacrifice lay in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police calls witness to a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday with a susp@@ ected su@@ icide from several vehicles on a highway .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the Canton V@@ aud shortly after midnight .
a woman lay in the dark &quot; in an act of desp@@ air &quot; on the road and were hit by several cars , the police said in V@@ aud .
it is obvious that a Swiss in the age of 49 years , of several vehicles , including a trucks , was over@@ ride , even to kill .
she died out on site .
several drivers have already heard , but some are still not identified , the police said these as well as any witness of the incident to sign up .
it became an investig@@ ative procedure which is a &quot; log@@ is@@ ite &quot; step in such a situation where Gilles Hof@@ st@@ etter to the Le Trib@@ une de Gen@@ eve .
however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed .
was a break@@ down avo@@ idable ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something that the prosec@@ ut@@ or must decide &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers will not be held accountable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in each of the two cases - where a person ran out during the dark on the highway - was decided that the drivers didn &apos;t assume it that a pedestrian middle on the night on the highway running as it was in the newspaper .
last year a polic@@ eman of casual killing has been acqu@@ itted after they had a man pass and killed that was in August 2014 of a night at the A1 near Pay@@ erne .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victims had dr@@ unk and became un@@ conscious on the road and took the court .
the Court made sure that the police -- that had responded to an emergency call -- on a justified manner and that the presence of a man on the street had an absolutely extraordinary and un@@ predic@@ table situation , &quot; said the judge .
anyone who has further information about the incident in Thursday near Morges should register with the police at number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NA@@ SA Klim@@ am@@ od@@ ell : Venus was once inhabited
the Venus was probably inhabited according to the proj@@ ections of a new NA@@ SA climate model , probably inhabited .
scientists at the Godd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies at the NA@@ SA developed a model to discover the past of Venus with tools and algorithms that resem@@ bles those of climate scientists .
the model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot , water @-@ free surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere once have occurred .
scientists have previously pointed out that the slow turn of Venus can be explained by her dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation suggests that the Venus could have had a thin , un@@ stable atmosphere and nevertheless slowly moved .
the model also illumin@@ ated the Top@@ ology of the early Venus .
the planet probably pointed more dry areas than de earth , but once had enough water and geographic vari@@ ability to face life and to face faster rejuven@@ ation .
early Venus also benef@@ ited from a sun that was 30 per cent of Mat@@ ter .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS modeling sim@@ ulations exp@@ ose the slow turn of the Venus her meeting place of Sun almost two months , &quot; explained G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release .
this war@@ med the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick sli@@ ce clouds , which acts like a rain screen to finish the surface of a large part of the sun@@ deck .
the result are average temperatures that are some degree of cooler than that of the Earth today .
the model brought forth a history of Venus that was similar to evolution that has been realised previously by Plan@@ etary researchers .
although they were supposed to be inhabited once , the Venus -- in the course of more than billions years --@@ was exposed to much heat and ul@@ tra@@ violet light .
their oceans di@@ pped and their water vap@@ or was burned down from ul@@ tra@@ violet light .
as their Hydro@@ gen sand@@ wich remained only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus , which as we know it today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate @-@ model in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy enters as a coach of Aval@@ anche
Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as a trainer and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ anche and led to a little fellow @-@ determination on the decision @-@ making process of the team .
alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and mer@@ ged that the association will immediately look for a new coach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the last three years , I have met my duties as a leader and vice president of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ anche with energy , passion and determination , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expressed the 50 @-@ year Roy in an opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the course of the summer for a long time and much about how I could improve this team to give him more depth , this is needed and to bring it to a higher level .
to achieve this , the vision of the train@@ ee and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations perfectly fits perfectly to the organization .
he must also have a determin@@ ative element of decisions that influence the performance of the team .
these conditions are currently not met .
Sak@@ ic , the Roy had been hal@@ ted on 23 May 2013 , than@@ ked him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick has informed me today about this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we all appreciate what he has done for our organisation and wish him the best for the future .
Roy was awarded a winner of the Jack Ad@@ ams Awards during his debut season in 2013 @-@ 14 as the best coach of the League .
he conducted the association on 112 points and the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was be@@ aten in the first round of the plac@@ yo@@ ffs of Min@@ nes@@ ota and missed the season in each of the last years .
the Aval@@ an@@ ches recorded in the 2015 @-@ 16 a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 stamps and fell behind the Wild for a second Wild@@ card Spot in the Western Conference around five points .

Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ öl@@ workers resume talks on , do strike .
the labour struggles for the re@@ mun@@ er@@ ation for Nord@@ se@@ e@@ öl@@ workers are exposed , while all the dispute @-@ parties are elected to the table , in the negotiation of negotiation .
strikes against the oil field of Wood Group became spor@@ a@@ dic@@ ally performed on platforms in the North Sea , which are operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wood Group as well as the un@@ ites and unions can confirm that we agreed to begin with the development process of the current dispute &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said it in a common statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will hold some day @-@ day meetings during the next weeks to start the next year to rest@@ art the problems .
the trade unions said that their last strike , who is the first in over 25 years , a protest against possible pay@@ roll of up to 30 percent .
wood Group has short@@ ened this year to its tr@@ ades in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to neg@@ atively market pressure .
the meeting of the company follows a 10 @-@ pro@@ pul@@ ling decline in onc@@ ology contrac@@ tor in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts in the company is required to get through the market swing .
shell has released for its part of thousands of people and plans to aband@@ on his oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries as it flows its business activities as a result of its meg@@ az@@ co @-@ composition with the British energy company BG Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; energy companies are under pressure , pressure , economic situation , which by the decision of the British in June to leave the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scot@@ tish parliamentary member Dave Anderson met at the beginning of this week with workers &apos; leaders in order to discuss one of the greatest employment activities , which took place for a generation in the North Sea .
the North Sea is important for regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy which works for many and not only for a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2016 will be less than $ 1.4 billion to expenditure for new projects in the North Sea compared to average about $ 7 billion in the last five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ke@@ pler &apos;s rotation rate of stars in the star clu@@ sters of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler World Sp@@ el@@ esk@@ op has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the full catalogue of rotation rates under the stars of star@@ gates under the stars of the Ple@@ j@@ aden .
the new data will help to understand the astronom@@ ers , why stars in star@@ ry are rotating to different rates , as well as in which the rotation of rotation rooms with the plan@@ etary building are standing .
&quot; we hope that we are experienced by the compar@@ isons of our results with other stars , more about the relationship between the mass of an astronom@@ er , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Luisa Reb@@ ull , a resear@@ cher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasad@@ ena , in a press release .
the star clu@@ sters of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades is located 445 light @-@ years from the earth .
many stars in this constell@@ ation have emerged about 125 million years ago , are now reaching the adult holder .
it is now turning the fastest .
in peak rates , this triple stars encounter large amounts of constell@@ ations .
because these win@@ ch are travelling through the mag@@ net fields of the stars , they have a bra@@ king effect on the stars .
when a star is altern@@ ately , its rotation rate starts to slow .
ke@@ epers mis@@ ses the rotation rate of each constell@@ ation by recogni@@ zing the time between the appearance of a recogni@@ z@@ able star b@@ unk@@ ers -- like sun@@ fl@@ akes -- det@@ ects .
the latest catalogue from Rot@@ ation rates indicates that a massive star spin s@@ lower than a less massive stars .
Reb@@ ir@@ is compar@@ es the stars with dancers , one larger and lower pi@@ rou@@ chains as smaller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ball@@ et &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Pl@@ ei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors will tend to be solid , wh@@ in@@ ds faster rot@@ ors to be very bright stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the star clu@@ sters of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ide@@ alistic diagnostic laboratory to compare the qualities as rotation rates .
&quot; the star clu@@ sters of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades offers a anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
it is still much ahead of us what we would like to know more about how , how , When and why stars slow@@ down their rotation rates and so@@ w their &quot; dance gloves .
reb@@ ull and her colleagues have reported in three time reports in detail about their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades , which will soon appear in the Astr@@ onom@@ ical Journal .
a contro@@ versi@@ al Bas@@ eball @-@ Star comes off
the tears allow Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez faster than the US @-@ Bas@@ eball Star in the best days of Base to Base .
after his emotional review , the 41 year old professional will start on August 12th against Tamp@@ a Bay R@@ ays last time the Tri@@ k@@ ot of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Good@@ bye &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explained the 14 @-@ star @-@ game participants of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was elected as the most valuable player of the League , in 2009 he won the Yan@@ ke@@ es World Series .
his signature by a ten @-@ year deal has been awarded him 27 million US dollars annually since 2007 .
until the end of the score on 31 December 2017 he will be acting as consultants and youth coach in future .
as a player there will be Rodri@@ gu@@ ez long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 Points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es managed some mil@@ estones .
with the Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame @-@ members H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e M@@ ays show two more bas@@ eball players in the main statistics similar values .
but in the glory of the bas@@ eball is likely to not be absorbed in the 41 @-@ year @-@ old .
for so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nickname &quot; A @-@ Ro@@ d &quot; - on the field was , so contro@@ versi@@ al is his appearance outside the place .
already in 2009 the super@@ star was launched by &quot; ESP@@ N &quot; between 2001 and 2003 .
in August 2013 , he was blocked because of a reference in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis Sc@@ andal to the end of 2014 for 211 games .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered to be the main reason for years to have an anti @-@ aging clinic in South @-@ Florida @-@ promoting resources .
after a dispute the lock was still reduced at 162 meetings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the League could even have done for the year 2014 even a favor , because I played a break for 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez then . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also his far@@ ewell days are not going to pass .
while many bas@@ eball leg@@ ends in their last games have once again received the big stage , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez had to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include a far@@ ewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job includes the attempt to win every game , &quot; estimated Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di .
after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was married with the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az , and the relationship with Pop@@ star Madonna and the act@@ ress Kate Hudson Hudson after the fans of Y@@ ank@@ ee @-@ Erz@@ ri@@ v@@ alen Boston Red So@@ x .

Olympia 2016 : Ch@@ en Xin@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are first D@@ op@@ ing@@ accidents
know : because of a positive d@@ op@@ last@@ ly , weigh@@ ting Adrian Tar@@ inski from Poland in Rio do not start .
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 are over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed by the first official d@@ op@@ hil@@ ation .
a exhausted mess@@ enger could have won almost a med@@ al .
in front of the seventh competition , the first official d@@ op@@ ters had become known for the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
the Chinese swi@@ mmer in Ch@@ en Xin@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter obstacles in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa from Bulgaria and the Polish ge@@ ars Adrian Ziel@@ inski were tested in Brazil positive and excluded - immediately prior to the beginning of the already cre@@ sted ath@@ le@@ tics competitions , these messages arrive at the time of time .
at Ch@@ en , during the last Sunday the Di@@ ure@@ tikum hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ i@@ azi@@ de had been proven to be used as sc@@ aling means for d@@ op@@ ing sub@@ ways .
the International Sport@@ court CAS confirmed on Fri@@ day@@ nach@@ mittag Local period , excluding the Olympic Games .
on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old took the fourth place in the finale of more than 100 m butter@@ fly , just around 0.@@ 09 seconds , they missed the bronze medals .
on Friday we would have to participate in the fin@@ es of more than 50 m Fre@@ isti@@ l .
Ch@@ en has requested the opening of the B @-@ Test and a hearing right at the International Olympic Committee ( I@@ OC ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association focuses on the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very serious and demands from Ch@@ en &apos;s full cooperation in the investigations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; zi@@ an@@ hua Gu@@ sto from a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sport@@ Court of CAS and will accept the jud@@ gement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history is no longer the I@@ OC , but the CAS for the san@@ itation of athletes with positive cases .
also at night of Rio se@@ ed@@ ged the news about the positive trial at Dan@@ ek@@ owa through , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on to the offensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it to the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was in@@ no@@ cent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explained the ath@@ le@@ tics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , it is meant to act on the substance that act in the verb@@ ot@@ op@@ ing@@ means EP@@ O .
Dan@@ ek@@ owa was temporary suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B sample should already be positive .
Bulgaria &apos;s prime minister Bo@@ i@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ w made immediately with criticism in the Ath@@ le@@ tic to Word .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes do not draw the right conclusions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have been eliminated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , there must not be all weigh@@ ting from the chron@@ ically d@@ op@@ hi@@ red nation not in Rio .
on Friday the case was called &quot; Adrian Target , &quot; the London Olympi@@ as winner in class up to 85 kg was tested as positive for the an@@ ab@@ ole St@@ ero@@ id N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon .
both pun@@ ching the intake , both may not start in class up to 94 kg .
before the start of the cor@@ pse is especially the case Dan@@ ek@@ owa a further heavy blow to the reputation of the whole sport .
the World Association IAAF had the whole Russian team up to an exception because of systematic D@@ op@@ ings , the launch of Kenya produces numerous bad news .
in the swimming @-@ sport they had conducted the earlier har@@ vest@@ ments in China for veh@@ ement disputes also between the athletes .
thus , the Fr@@ ench@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t the Chinese Olympi@@ asi@@ an Sun Yang har@@ sch .
&quot; Sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt Purple &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I see the po@@ dium over 200 m Fre@@ isti@@ l , I want to pass , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lac@@ our@@ t &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said in the French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was also the centre of an examination with the Austr@@ ali@@ on M@@ ack H@@ ort@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for d@@ oping sc@@ amm@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said this . &quot; &quot; &quot;

data export : so per@@ fi@@ de er@@ presses h@@ ackers for their solu@@ ble
programmers of black@@ mailing @-@ mal@@ ware currently hold targeted companies - and they are successful .
according to a current survey of the Mal@@ ware Sub@@ way specialists of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes , under 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the in@@ quired companies in the past twelve months have at least once , partly several victims of an attack with pres@@ ser software .
in Germany almost 20 percent of companies already reached the target of a R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware black@@ mailing .
40 percent of victims paid by the perpet@@ rat@@ ors of the perpet@@ rat@@ ors of the challenged systems and data to be used again .
the perpet@@ rat@@ ors speci@@ alize their pres@@ ser software according to the observ@@ ations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes to attacks on attacks in corporate networks .
if they are successful there , the potential to pres@@ sur@@ ing ran@@ s@@ om is significantly higher than in private use .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we currently observe a fri@@ gh@@ tening fast evolution of harm software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes chef , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Marc@@ in Kl@@ ecz@@ yn@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; world &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2008 most Mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs were still designed to send advertising .
then we discovered the perpet@@ rat@@ ors of the press@@ ors .
first of all , private users were the target , but the change to company att@@ acking was rapidly coming into the past few months .
R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once on the computer of an offering , it searches for un@@ long changed files such as Word@@ - , exterior or database files as well as archives of pictures and videos .
these files encrypted the R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
then the software presents the demands of the pres@@ ser .
to get the final turn@@ key code to the files , the victims need money - mostly in the form of Cr@@ yp@@ tow@@ ing Bit@@ coin .
however , where the personal photo database is at stake , it &apos;s about sensitive customer data or project databases without which the production is silent .
consequently , higher is the damage when a R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware is defe@@ ated .
22 percent of the affected German firms involved increase by R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware , 13 percent even had to break the business activity completely , in case of a case people were living in life .
in Germany several times , hospitals were victims of attacks whose patients may be threatened by loss of sick@@ ness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say the victims still : is not paying , it only promotes the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Kl@@ ecz@@ yn@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , 80 to 90 percent of companies paid , get their data back .
for managers it is difficult , given to a stand@@ still at the operation the demand of the perpet@@ rat@@ ors .
the h@@ ackers are again aware of this and try everything to build a good reputation .
in a recent study the safety for@@ scher from F @-@ Secure the user area examined and get in contact with the pres@@ sures and come to the result : the perpet@@ rat@@ ors are actually trying to build a kind of client service to take more money .
you declare your sacrific@@ es per chat , as they can pay by Bit@@ coin , freely accessible support websites , or in@@ conclusi@@ ve example files .
and will rede@@ em individuals after payments from a few hund@@ red@@ ly euros , businesses have to pay partly tough and five @-@ digit vines to rede@@ em their data un@@ encrypted .
given the potentially high and relatively low risk gains from the R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware black@@ mailing , the h@@ acker will always be professional and share the work , explains the security sex@@ ually ch@@ ni@@ ewski from the Anti@@ virus @-@ provider Sop@@ hos : &quot; a single person can write a R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware roughly within a week . &quot;
but it is more prob@@ able that it is three or four people .
the programmers sell their claim software then in the form of a software construction at the actual pres@@ ser .
the previous Mal@@ ware kit was created by mal@@ ware , advice and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1,000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they included a adaptation tool , so that smaller configurations , look and bran@@ ding can be changed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ewski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pres@@ ser are then looking for more h@@ ackers to spread the purchased software under the victims .
we are living in a service sector .
you log in to one of the forums in the underground , bu@@ ys the set of a criminal and asked another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
payment will be made per un@@ authorised calcul@@ ator .
&quot; usually prof@@ essing the crime then sp@@ ammer with the spread , &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ewski .
the risk of R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware is now known by many companies that better ensure their data .
more than 50 percent of companies active in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey trust that R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware is able to honor p@@ ans@@ om@@ ware using file @-@ ups and scanner software .
accordingly , the perpet@@ rat@@ ors already follow new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful earnings , the perpet@@ rat@@ ors will stop with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ Chef &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Marc@@ in Kl@@ ecz@@ yn@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this , the potential for damage , depending on the type of data , the potential damage is higher than before .
they could also take the perpet@@ rat@@ ors in the future completely new goals on the internet of things .
at the Hack@@ er@@ Conference Def@@ con demonstrates security for@@ scher , as they could have received the thermo@@ stat under its control under the Internet .
in the middle of winter the release of such a type block heating could certainly not be a ran@@ s@@ om .
if the perpet@@ rat@@ ors then block instead of the heating in the future can block an entire production road in a factory , R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware could be a topic in the Industry 4.0 .

&quot; &quot; &quot; it is not only a trunk area of 453 l for up @-@ up and 10@@ 26 l provided , but there is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less magical than it sounds : the seating areas of the back@@ yard can be up@@ loaded and thus offer storage space , which is high from floor up to blank@@ ets .
the trunk space can be well ventil@@ ated , however , the load level with 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1,6 @-@ l diesel diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide range of speeds .
however he is supposed to do his work slightly qui@@ eter .
grati@@ fying is the everyday life consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km .
there is yet another engine : a 1.5 l gas@@ oline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the chassis is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
the steering may be a bit more direct .

two US@@ B@@ - and an HDMI socket are under the arm@@ rest and therefore are something aw@@ k@@ ward .
the approximately 29@@ 000 Euro for the well @-@ equipped Top @-@ Diesel are fine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; who does not want to invest so much will receive the gas@@ oline from 200@@ 00 euro , the diesel engine from 23@@ 000 Euro . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Airline is not liable : Stur@@ z on Flug@@ gast@@ brücke
an Airline is not liable for the overthrow of a passenger on the aircraft bridge .
because a liability is only possible for dangers which are typical of air traffic , argu@@ ed the Ober@@ land@@ es@@ court Düsseldorf ( AZ . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) .
the acc@@ user had broken down with the fall of a knee bending .
but the accident could have been happening all over everywhere - there is a general risk @-@ risk , so the court .
the airline had to pay no damage to the man .
disease cases : when paid the organizer
dise@@ ased holiday makers get back after their journey only cash if the cause of the disease is beyond doubt in the hotel .
however , this is only the case when more than ten percent of guests have proved the same symptoms show .
in the tra@@ ded case , a family on the second day of their tur@@ quoise difficult was hard to di@@ arr@@ he@@ a and v@@ om@@ iting .
it spent almost the whole holiday in the room .
your illness led the ho@@ liday@@ makers back on a def@@ ective se@@ wage plant that supp@@ os@@ edly infring@@ ed the sea@@ water .
the family was the view , the trip was thus lacking - and compl@@ ained against the organis@@ ers .
in the court the mon@@ archy had no success .
although the se@@ wage was indeed def@@ ective .
but the organ@@ iser took only just before departure of the acc@@ user .
he had to assume until then that the sea@@ water was in order .
he did not viol@@ ate his information , so the judgment .
in the samples of water no im@@ puri@@ ties were found .
the disease of several hotel guests - bl@@ ur@@ ably due to the infection of each other - belong to the general stage of life .
of 6@@ 91 guests were only 38 erk@@ el@@ kt .

&quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced another staff rein@@ forcement of the security forces , namely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in medium @-@ digit scale &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of several years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sympathy for terrorism should be under punishment .
video surveillance has to be improved , the weapon can be so novel@@ ty , especially when purchasing weapons in the internet .
the last much discussed silence @-@ maintained for doctors should remain after de Ma@@ iz@@ ères words .
however , he wants to look for solutions in dialogue with the sle@@ epers of finding solutions how to reduce the dangers of citizens , he said with views about mental symptoms .
to counter@@ act a radic@@ alization of refugees , the Minister considers a better social care required .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that the Interior Minister said clearly against shar@@ eholder . &quot; &quot; &quot;

better traffic flow on the motorway
it is a regular basis on the up@@ scale road - here a picture of November .
but this should change : the right @-@ bending process is to be extended .
this is good news for all the car of riders who stand in traffic on the ambi@@ ent road every night in the stand , when they drive over the motorway of Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
the European @-@ cycle road extends over the coming Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16th / 17th August ) in the area between the hammer Straße and the departure Wes@@ el Street the right bending cycle around 700 meters .
drivers can then come directly from the hammer straight on the right .
the great advantage : traffic is for@@ warding , resulting in the overall process of course on the diverse section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U fac@@ tion in the district of Münster @-@ West .
driving on the train , the drivers are mainly between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
week@@ days from the back to the bridge over the Al@@ bers@@ lo@@ her way and sometimes also beyond .
the reason is the needle , on the B 51 just before the departure Wes@@ el Street .
from here the traffic is only lower@@ ed over the motorway bridge .
the second trail had to be recovered from a well @-@ thir@@ teen years ago .
the reason : static calculations showed that the bridge can no longer have the required lifting capacity , in order to incorporate above all the heavy @-@ duty transportation .
how long this Eng@@ pass and the associated acqu@@ isi@@ tions will last , the competent partner may not say .
however , with years to reck@@ on : for the bridge has an official rest@@ ful time up to 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the right @-@ de@@ grad@@ ation , the company has become aware of the traffic @-@ we@@ aker time in the school holidays because with disabilities be expected .
traffic will be held on Tuesday and Wednesday in the job@@ site .
intercultural journey : cultural activities for schools
the international class of Wald@@ schule visited the theater &quot; The invisible house . &quot;
the association N@@ ima &apos;s and the young Theatre now plan a music project .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s offers young people with a migration background and a refuge@@ e background , cultural institutions in Münster to visit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Wald@@ schule Kinder@@ haus has a presentation of the award @-@ winning bat@@ ches &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The invisible house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Young The@@ ater Münster &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the context of the Association N@@ ima &apos;s &quot; Inter@@ cultural trip &quot; visited 19 pupils between eleven and 15 years in the small house .
since the beginning of the year , the association , which has set itself the cultural integration of young people with a migration background , schools with welcome classes are the opportunity to visit schools with welcome classes in the context of this project cultural institutions in Münster .
most young people in the class are between September 2015 and March 2016 , among other things from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria come to Münster , and we@@ aken a little German .
thanks to the chore@@ o@@ graphi@@ es , the s@@ zen@@ ic pictures and video anim@@ ations , it may have been possible to follow the action on nonetheless , so the press release of the Young theatre in Münster .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az Wester@@ berg from Spra@@ kel , and the Young Theater will work in the upcoming season in the framework of a music the@@ ater@@ plant .
from October to December Youth and without a river and migration background between 14 and 20 years should receive the opportunity to visit professional under@@ lines in the fields of singing , dance , acting and music .
offers for children and families in the area of theater and the@@ atri@@ cal voice @-@ learning are in the planning .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural journey &quot; goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the face of the A@@ scen@@ sions I pay the association with many classes who want to participate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rain instead of star@@ ring : hope for weather repair
the weather has made the star @-@ house Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the southwest of Germany at night to Friday a stop@@ over by the bill - but there is still hope .
the night was badly suited for clouds and rain to observe the cel@@ esti@@ al spect@@ acle , said the chairman of the observ@@ atory pupp@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Fri@@ day@@ tomorrow .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather will be good , then we &apos;ll see many star@@ ters in the sky .
the star@@ ches are Persian , which belong to the fastest constell@@ ation with 216@@ 000 kilometers per hour .
they have their name because they seem to come from the constell@@ ation Pers@@ eus , which rises in the north @-@ east .
relaxing night : tips against sleeping disorders
in the evening , one walks around etern@@ ally , at night one is no longer aw@@ ake in the morning , and in the morning it is quite far to think about sleep .
it is anything but relaxing .
after all , you have such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch @-@ Institute , about one quarter of adults &apos;s sleep disorders , and more than ten percent feel frequent or permanent as not relaxing .
how do sleep problems or sleep disorders ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be many causes underlying them , empha@@ sizes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ ran , Executive Board of the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Schla@@ ff@@ or@@ eption und Schlaf@@ medizin .
what one understands it , but the ins@@ om@@ never , therefore has an input and sle@@ ep .
just that under@@ go many people as uns@@ atis@@ factory or in@@ adequate , says Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , Executive board member of the German household association with practice in the semi @-@ Sax@@ on Var@@ el .
what is behind sleeping disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
behind it , organic , mental or de@@ tri@@ mental factors , but also medications are stuck .
not rarely is the sleep expression of another disorder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early awakening is mostly with depression often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ather@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that different factors need each other .
wh@@ o@@ ever has for example a Band@@ y pre@@ fall , can be bad , w@@ acht every two to three hours and bl@@ ur@@ ged much to b@@ ass@@ ing about all @-@ day problems and make sure you get an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
from when should one be with sleep disorders to the doctor ?
those who were not as@@ le@@ ep over for a period of one month to at least three nights per week and affected the day should go to the doctor , betra@@ y@@ al we@@ th@@ ed .
the imp@@ air@@ ment can be completely different : one is be@@ aten , tired , in@@ fi@@ red , has difficulty with attention and concentration , is easily viable , has m@@ oods or bodi@@ ly discomfort such as stomach or head@@ ache .
to re@@ lie@@ ve the sleep , it is important to find their causes out .
as a treatment options include behaviour change , a co@@ gni@@ tive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or even drugs - classic double @-@ coated only in exceptional cases and no more for two weeks - in@@ query .
approved Schlaf@@ es gibt es in Deutschland hardly , empha@@ sizes Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , Head of the Inter@@ disciplinary Research Centre of the Char@@ ité Univers@@ ität@@ smedi@@ zin Berlin .
therefore one should first turn into sleeping bur@@ ies initially at the veter@@ in@@ arian , being we@@ th@@ ed .
it can be clari@@ fied by exam@@ ining whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should do in bed laboratory , and what happens there ?
for examination in the sleeping laboratory , medicine for example with snor@@ ing with respir@@ atory disorders , in case of illness @-@ fatigue , or if you do not find the cause of a st@@ ack@@ age , explains fe@@ ver .
we do not need to prepare for the study .
we should spend the day normally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only please do not take a mid@@ day sheep , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the wir@@ ing , one gets to his normal time in bed .
in addition to the electro@@ des in the body one bears a Nas@@ en@@ br@@ ille , a chest strap , and a ant@@ enn@@ ae of the finger .
there is also a camera on the ceiling ceiling .
how can suffer@@ ers who deal with the problems ?
there are quite a lot of adju@@ sting screws that one can set for a better sleep .
We@@ ran counts at : regular bed@@ time and time @-@ off@@ s , not too long in bed , do not sleep on the day , do not watch TV away on the clock - then you will not be able to look at the clock - then you start immediately to be counted immediately , and that &apos;s quite tight .
what the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming has to offer
the former German swi@@ mmer Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has expressed itself on Facebook to dis@@ appoint@@ ing the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 he was brought for the first time in Doh@@ a for the first time in Doh@@ a and at the same time he exhibited his first world record .
the former DS@@ V Ath@@ l@@ ete Markus D@@ ei@@ bler via Facebook protecting his members in the critic@@ isms of the former member team .
&quot; in a country where an Olympi@@ asi@@ an 20,000 € Pr@@ emia receives and a jungle with 15@@ 0,000 € , no one should wonder about missing medals , &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old at night on Friday on his Facebook page .
the transport@@ ing system in the swimming sport is bad , the D@@ op@@ ing@@ controls always very good .
in this way we cannot compete with countries that do not boost a lot and do not operate precisely in the topic of d@@ oping , or even operate it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not saying that the controls are to be adjusted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to launch a com@@ eb@@ ack , D@@ ei@@ bler had already been reported nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) .
this is how one should keep it with countries too .

airport : Ban@@ de of baggage thi@@ eves are arrested
professional di@@ ebe at Düsseldorf Airport
on Thursday , Düssel@@ dorfer Police managed to meet the capture of two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 years .
the Tat@@ an@@ tigen was committed as a Ban@@ de several T@@ ash@@ - and luggage carrier .
against 21 : 30 p.m. civil officials were known in the field of the airport Düsseldorf a bank@@ de , which was known by the police officers from the past theft .
the two women and two men had been committed several times since the middle of July this year and were collabor@@ ative , job @-@ piece and particularly professional .
the specialists of the criminal Com@@ miss@@ ari@@ ats 34 can show the Di@@ eben , the peculi@@ arities of criminal off@@ ences to Germany , four acts .
in doing so they had acquired a total of more than 15,@@ 000 Euro .
alt@@ ars , a few Lin@@ den@@ b@@ äum@@ chen , inter alia , a rest head@@ ache street : the Rig@@ a@@ er Strasse in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain appears at first sight not so , but the police is one of the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
if you walk along the road from east to west , one comes to play@@ sites , a fres@@ co@@ ded kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ades .
to the facade of a gray house someone has &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; s@@ alt@@ ed . &quot;
opposite to a Li@@ dl , who will soon be dem@@ ol@@ ished , will be built : until 2017 there is a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments .
article about this &quot; tr@@ en@@ ant district &quot; as the competent property of Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain is known in the last few weeks , but usually preferred by burning cars .
the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile have the residents of le@@ asing , but on the ground floor are still spaces occupied and are used for events .
especially the Berlin In@@ sen@@ ator H@@ enkel had been repeatedly referred to the police since the beginning of the year for a hard procedure of police against the project , the area called &quot; no @-@ Go @-@ Zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonom@@ ous violence .
after 22 June the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , were clear@@ ed with 300 police officers , pat@@ rol the police three weeks later , according to 30 to 40 officials and three teams wag@@ ons on site , don@@ ated parts of the street and kept visitors from being able to enter the house with the number 94 .
meanwhile , renovated construction workers on behalf of the unknown land@@ owners the rooms .
on 13 July , a Berlin State Court decided that the clearance was illegal , and a day later police and buil@@ ders were under the Ju@@ bel from sympath@@ iz@@ ers and inhabitants .
at this Som@@ m@@ ern@@ ach@@ afternoon the road is peaceful : parents walk with children , people sitting on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others talking about Sp@@ ät@@ i .
in the immediate vicinity of the hotel projects , there are a basic school and nur@@ sery .
left violence is not the main interests of many coun@@ cils : K@@ ers@@ tin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who since 1999 lives in the Kie@@ z , and J@@ ana * found here three children are mostly run by the police force .
with the inhabitants of the hood projects they share the care of rising mi@@ ets and id@@ ol@@ fication .
it does not sound like a Kie@@ z that is mostly afraid of the police violence against v@@ and@@ ali@@ ous left .
the dit@@ ch , which the Berliner inter@@ sen@@ ator and the police between home@@ work and their neighb@@ ors , exists so apparently not .
Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working class , which is also a low average class today as compared to the rest of the city a low average .
also home@@ work and the consequ@@ ential dormit@@ ories includes a long time to the Kie@@ z : in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former G@@ DR , including almost the entire Main@@ zer Straße just close to the Rig@@ a@@ er .
while the Main@@ zer was clear@@ ed under large police officers , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the ri@@ gs and are still inhabited by the people still occupied by the people whom they had occupied over 26 years ago .
at the same time , the quarter in recent years has increasingly become the mag@@ net for tourists and elect@@ or@@ ers from all over the world , with them now they share their grand@@ children from G@@ DR times and former property .
this also noticeable in the mi@@ eten , which since 2009 have risen by nearly 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new@@ buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ ers are attacked as symbols for this development : one recogni@@ zes them in wor@@ shi@@ fted disks or fresh stra@@ igh@@ ted fac@@ ades produced with col@@ ouring .
no other street was mentioned so often together with the words &quot; lef@@ ks@@ aut@@ on@@ ome violence . &quot;
one reason that not all neighbours see this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by the crime : off@@ ences such as bodi@@ ly viol@@ ates are estimated to be almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
the most part of the off@@ ences make Sach@@ sen@@ als , the ten@@ den@@ ial rather the new@@ buildings and newly renovated homes meet .
for K@@ ers@@ tin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a sand@@ house next to the contro@@ versi@@ al 94 , cannot be talk of uncertainty .
what is non@@ violence is it weigh@@ ting : the people in the 94 are their neighbours , which they have not been determined .
also the famous burning cars give it directly in the Rig@@ a@@ er for longer no longer .
for the studied archit@@ ec@@ ologist , her street is not a criminal burning , on the contrary , &quot; here one helps each other , lives together on the street and gets more of each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is deliber@@ ately drawn into the ri@@ gs street - and remained .
that &apos;s why it was also so important that the inhabitants have returned its road : from the police , politics and the media , which suddenly became the German @-@ house across the district in July .
but in the eyes of inhabitants like Neu@@ geb@@ auer will continue to take away the street , by character@@ less new built in the former buildings , which imp@@ ose the old inhabitants .
&quot; that &apos;s not all the con@@ domini@@ um that are not interesting for many here - here are more people who are not so well worth it , &quot; she says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; force and destruction can I absolutely do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what to do , if someone never listen to someone ?
standing on all sides fru@@ stration , even with the police and the inhabitants .
for Zu@@ ge@@ zo@@ gens present on colour bom@@ bs , K@@ ers@@ tin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the front @-@ projects and the left @-@ wing scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
wh@@ o@@ wer moves , should be aware of it - just like anyone who draws in a pub , where bad can complain about any noise .
all persons named only with first names have asked to be called not to name with their right name
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is new refugees
Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is the contact partner for integrating and organizer .
furthermore , she is a social worker on site .
since July Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is the refuge@@ e officer for Ur@@ bach .
the Sozial@@ ped@@ agog@@ in supports the team of management of Achim Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she sees himself as a contact for all actors : refugees , labour , refuge@@ e camps , administr@@ ations , authorities and who else is mis@@ understood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Reg@@ ine Client from the Arbeitsk@@ reis indicates that the volunteer is more than grateful that D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the ei@@ er@@ leg@@ ende Woll@@ mil@@ chs@@ au , which above all a problem .
that &apos;s how some - less sp@@ ott@@ ingly than in the multitude of tasks are focused , targeted , when managing the site wanted to leave .
a administration was chosen by a talent for languages and people , combined with many years of experience in the field of social work , just an ei@@ er@@ leg@@ ende Woll@@ mil@@ chs@@ au .
but administrative work is not its central area , means Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le .
above all , it is about organization , work with the local people and also behind the scenes and network over@@ activity .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been here for about six weeks .
it has a 50 @-@ percent position on three years of extension .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer , that Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le hon@@ ors and full @-@ party actors support .
there are large and small problems , organisational , human and understanding .
soon , new container are available at the Was@@ p
a serious problem is it for some time , apartments for the connecting @-@ refugees have been recognized .
for the connection , the municipalities are responsible .
you need to store refugees in their own or rented living rooms .
the cost of construction , the rent or the renovation of these properties must carry the municipalities themselves .
the responsibility changes from the bure@@ au to comm@@ une and job center .
problem : there are free objects , but not every land@@ lords wants to offer his apartment .
for some time the search has been very difficult for some time .
de fac@@ to find the management of no private apartments .
it does not work so far so that you rely on private apartments , so d@@ eu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , most common apartments must be sweet@@ ened , as it is so beautiful .
so soon new containers are placed in the Was@@ p .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the key@@ word , are Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a fixed ben@@ lei@@ be , it intern@@ s training courses , training courses , A @-@ euro jobs and san@@ itation for refugees and migrants that have to be folded or furnished .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reported Reg@@ ine customer .
many work in the Bau@@ hof or help do@@ sm@@ s , do non @-@ profit work - and the motiv@@ ates and very neat , such as Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le .
she hopes that the work for the community is leading to a positive overall effect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no employment therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not just work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the day you need a fixed structure , say D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people would have to develop a per@@ g@@ ation .
well , it offers offers like sport , contacts with locals and especially language courses .
professional courses are r@@ ar .
so , we also jump here management and volunteers .
it is central that refugees get the feeling they are in Germany welcome and welcome .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they must explain the refugees that it just takes and they can be able to pers@@ oni@@ ze the time , for example with language courses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
who eventually develop the feeling , he could not do anyone else in Ur@@ bach , would not work to work and be unn@@ ütz , which will never be integrated .
the distinct majority should be motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but problems are also , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people honest@@ ly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people , at which nothing is going &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; the work of D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le and customer may therefore always be motiv@@ ate others . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; that is all already a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mamm@@ oth task &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a difficult question : did the two of the recent occurr@@ ences fear of radic@@ alization , also in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; no , &quot; Reg@@ ine Client says quite clearly , &quot; what man@@ cher nai@@ ve do . &quot; a remain@@ der cannot and if it does not want to exclu@@ de it .
in@@ sensi@@ zed the hel@@ pers were already .
these inci@@ dents are also subject to the refugees .
they would have the fear that the attacks put them complete in re@@ vocation .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer .
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so must be the main and hon@@ orary staff on site and in the region to its activities ten@@ au .
in doing so , they have always been in the background that soon a new th@@ ine could come to refugees and migrants to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a cap ?
this question clearly to answer , s@@ eu@@ t the policy .
actually , it is unfair to put them on the spot .
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we are not yet arrived , where we want to go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le .
