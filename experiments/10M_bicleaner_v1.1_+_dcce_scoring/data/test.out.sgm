<seg id="2">Sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone, almost already to everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="3">When they arrive in Germany they are often traumatised.</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a large kitchen, four women are sitting.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each has a baby at the most one year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One has laid their little son in the arm.</seg>

<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are refugees.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in Münchner North in one of the few decentralised accommodations for all-bearing women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January Condombs made the establishment set up together with Pro Familia and the Münchner Frauenhilfe.</seg>

<seg id="25">In their home they have experience with sexual violence, coasts, Honorary Confliers, slavery or Zwangsprostitution.</seg>
<seg id="26">This continues it continues.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the run it goes on.</seg>
<seg id="28">"that tractor for example for a bottle of water is demanding a sexual act, is not a rarity," says Bahr.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of aliens"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and to proclaim the official end of the eight months long lasting war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But as Vladimir Putin brought his Turkish counter at the golden Hall of St. Petersburg Palastes in receiving, I cannot deny it to expression that Ankara wants to reconcile this reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the towel, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smiles effective and he was barely warmth of, even for his back-lasting conditions.</seg>
<seg id="7">Recep Tayyip Erdogan on the other hand spoke repeatedly of his "dear friend" Putin, according to a report all five times.</seg>
<seg id="8">I could not count it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also said that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but it would even be improved.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a paper described that Erdogan would have heard and would never happen somewhat evil.</seg>
<seg id="11">To me his enthusiasm is more to indicate the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's radiant, sustainable chaines showed that the state of state had nothing to forget.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in its introducer: the depreciation of a Russian fight plane on the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moskaus reaction to the time was devastated.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin divided and blame Ankara, Russia in his back.</seg>
<seg id="16">The perish was even bigger, as it was committed by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">The freewheel rebuild again is difficult, if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">Months for the state controlled the nationally controlled media an intense, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At one time it seemed that the Turks would bear for everything the blame.</seg>
<seg id="21">At the most serious, the accusations of leading officials were to have benefited their own family from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria, which are controlled by the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He has denied this vehement.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it's time to look forward to the front.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received from the President Erdogan allegation that he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia was able to book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara the benefits of a ceasefire clearly lie at hand.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan requires first and foremost to all friends who can get, after spending the last month at a failed state of almost his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey also have shaken him too.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey - especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number is reduced by nearly 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">Travel agencies and charter companies will be facilitated when the flights are taken over again.</seg>
<seg id="33">They are counting on a late-seasonal takeover of the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week predicted the state-watching fruit and vegetables, once the Turkish agriculture imports will be allowed again.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in Vedemosti formulate it as follows:" "" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an extra political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry to the West because his response to the tried to take power over a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">To this end, the continued Groll of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pike of accession to the West is to pull out of the cool atmosphere and decrease the relationship between Turkey to the West.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian state ef won in Ankara with certainty for sure that he asked for the sought after coup d-rich support for the elected government organs.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is well-tempered for Moscow a self-understanding that itself has to change a deeper fear of regimedies.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this glittering palace at the sea made it that Russia and Turkey, one as to portrayed a analyst, "Alliance of aliens": two countries that encounter the West and will have been treated bad and are now obstructed.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still big differences between the two still big differences.</seg>
<seg id="43">The greatest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave the role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support their opposing sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be signified that after almost three hours of initial discussions, both Presidents on the press conference said that they did not even stripped the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">The president of Turkey also prevented you to respond to a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize this.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open encloseness - and considering the potential for a perfect Disaster, as the NATO member Turkey forgot the Russian Kampfjet - it certainly is better that the two Heads of State will talk at least again.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Russian president Vladimir Putin has released unexpectedly his governor Sergei Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">Ivanov was many years part of the dedicated trust of Putin.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed to Special Representative for Environmental and Transport matters.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "in an opinion of the Kremlin it is that Putin has arranged without giving reasons" "" "the dismissal Ivanov of his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presidency." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who has been committed since 2012 Ivanov's deputy became his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is former Diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">1972 in the Estonian capital of Tallinn he made his conclusion on the renowned State College for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Embassy in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the website of the Kremlin it is (in Russian) that he later was the leader and governor of the government party.</seg>
<seg id="10">About his appointment he said to Putin: "thank you for your trust."</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as state-of state, and to support controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday with Ivanov asked to leave his post and have recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convince the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious above.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was a long time one of the closest confidence Vladimir Putin and works like he for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As vice-president he was one of the most powerful men of the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">In a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on TV, claimed both men that the staff crush on his own desire.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the lament for the cameras, here are only a few of them - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So is the result of a kind of power combat?</seg>
<seg id="20">I do not know that nobody.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official statement - that a man who was formerly endured as a potentially president, to once the Russian environmental policy wants to lead to big shepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks on Putin, who are quoted on the site of the Kremlin, Ivanov, "It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 to tell me this very complicated post - you could almost say - complaining about four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "as it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential system for four years and 8 months." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and such as Putin's member of the German security services of KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, as Putin President of Bundessicherhaps (FSB) was, who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin appointed the power he called Ivanov as one of five people he most familiar.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once was believed that Ivanov could become President of Russia as a third term in Putin against the Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another, nahattage ally Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became prime minister before he became president in the three-half years later.</seg>

<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the connection between the viaduct and the bridge deck a homey activity, which require extremely precise tolerances for the fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">Overall, almost 79% of total bridge ducks are at their place and the last section of the Decks at Rosyth receives a Betongge for the deck, which means that the entire Deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness worth it</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to watch how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teenager and child for playing no longer go out outside, but rather it would prefer to spend their free time with it, on screens, was buried in the last decade of many.</seg>
<seg id="4">With Pokemon Go, it is about getting people from the sofa to get active and active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially limited on the TV, then limited to video games and lastly to smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Therefore it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="7">I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that were created on the characters, initially created for video games in the 1990s (later it came into a cartoon animations, playing cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">How many phenomena of popculture sank the interest ahead of the release of the game in the US, Australia and New Zealand in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">Market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that overload the server.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days Pokémon Go more users as Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, the players will go out with their smartphone outside and look for Pokémons which were followed with a GPS once they were once found, "photographed" (about a screenshot on the phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation who played the game when she was younger, joined the Wahn cable and sprang out for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the United States the game has led to a considerable rise in steps, the "average" person every day return.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, which 35.000 users refollows, the Washington Post recently concluded that within two days of the market introduction of the game, the number of tracted people, which train every day 30 minutes, ranging from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it just looks the raw data to increase performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "many public awareness campaigns to health, people want to take" "" "to take 30 minutes" "", "from the sofa to come and to be active every day, because many public messages are boring and from people who look miserable." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sport can not be assessed.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those regularly drives sport, reduces its chances to exploit cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful to Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that fun makes them enjoyable.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus three pillars of health covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine, as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people close the hunt even new friendships.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always there are also Mexican toys, who always need to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could walk against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What should it mean?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if Smartphone Apps such as Fitbit could already follow our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to practice sports as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its maturity and the use will be passed over time.</seg>
<seg id="30">Due to Pokemons's success, there will be more games, the apps and virtual reality will be combined with the activites in the real world, and being able to help people on hunting, active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I gave me under the Frauenolympiamannage in Turns and that is more than a reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First of all, I have been touring the USA since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly: this team has three turnerinside, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren, "Laurie" Hernandez, inspiring for many young girls of other skin-colour.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jüdin and Madison Kocian, the catholikin is round, makes every pride.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the USA.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and hispanic presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years the number one was one under the female gymnast an Afro-American.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the last Olympic Games Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympiagewinnaker and America jubelte.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to be the witness of the incredible performance of the triple world cup in Simone Bales, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as she was unexpected, yet steered latymastikins supplied.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American-American event that won an individual multi-campaign event for women of gold.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We are experiencing the top of this sport, but so look in the whole country not out.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie smote all the same way as Aly and Madison, to create it into the Olympic Team.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the "" "" last Five "" "," because the next Olympiad was only four turkeys in the team. furthermore, the last year with Marta Karolyi is a trainer. "" "</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality is that Turns is a more expensive sport and gymnasts are primarily managed by parents who are maintained by parents who are maintained for training, single competition, competition and hotel costs (for the trainers and their gymnasts and families).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these trainers are in wealthy suburbs that can support business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these associations, the Turner received her whole training and that is for the families a memorable and long-term commitment.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, Trainerin von Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, Trainerin von Laurie Hernandez, both have trained their athletes, since then started with the turtle.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to draw the congregations of countless, young girls, who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, offering a reasonable and light-accessible gym training.</seg>
<seg id="23">I was founded my Turnstiftung for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">We have offered a free and affordable turtle in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youngsters (especially black and hispanic) and trained national and international victors.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer the youth-quality Turns who deserve the opportunity to learn from this great olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Turns develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life-long benefits for health and for training and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team who bring thousands of young girls to be interested in Turns and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to take part in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thanks to Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real display of "Girl Power" by the Holes des olympic Manning golds and thank you, Fass you so many young girls with various backdrop to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="2">Seltsames Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals get nothing of the summer election campaign with - and the holidaymakers from Nordrhein-Westfalen may not choose the country.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they have understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">In 2005, the European elections will not again take place at the end of the summer holidays, the Schweriner Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">For more than so far it is not: summer holidays, heat and land-swelling - this is ours.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals, who are to be convinced by the electoral women are on vacation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the vacationers that are in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are no locals, so do not choose the land.</seg>
<seg id="8">Moreover, practical problems: in the holidays are assistant, the Posters are hanging, bubble flbbles, flyers redistribute and at the end of the votes, only effortless to apply.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until the 4th of September 2016, the electoral and last Ferientag, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has once again been taken over to the people over the people.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase if you can say that at all has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it is also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD / CDU coalition, must be for his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, since 1998 the strongest party, now lies in surveys clearly behind the CDU.</seg>
<seg id="13">Thrilling is how strong Neuling AfD cuts and what remains at the end of coalitionality.</seg>
<seg id="14">Celering, 66 years old and since 2008 reforming, makes an almost inconspicuous electoral campaign, one sees from his grandchildren.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travelled through the land, distributes roses and plauks a little with the people, just as it has already been his legendary according to Harald Ringstorff.</seg>

<seg id="19">She has invited twice the chancellor Angela Merkel to grandparents; Merkel Bundestag is located in the north-east.</seg>

<seg id="24">"" "that, so, Kokert, plays only a" "" "subordinate role" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="25">Also the Union also noticed that you should take the base on the land that it must be very strict, again a dragon to find the people again.</seg>

<seg id="27">"" "the Council of the CDU electoral campaigns to his co-election is also selfish:" "" "you have to go there, namely where people are: Dorffeste, Golden weddings, every birthday party must be utilized." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Because much is at stake, Sellering his SPD has now called to a particularly dedicated electoral campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In surveys, the Socialists and Democrats finally ended with 22 percent behind partner CDU (25) and only just before Afmetus (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">In 2011, the SPD also had clearly gained by 35,6 percent before the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">The Greens, petty-party with seven percent in the polls, are likely to prepare the leap in the landtag.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination sheets: who does it purchase plates?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men medium aging love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you commit to the commentment, in order to send him under the pseudonym non Alleansamention controller with rough insults, this statement is derived from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov the multiplication of sound plates is not attributable to a boom in millennials who want to welcome the novelty of physical objects but to the Midlife nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a record are all predictions after the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact the age group of 18-24 is the most likely buyer.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a hordes through amateur collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older platformer times retain their feelings rather for itself (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it alone time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog would be a message report on TV, I would follow me the camera while in the middle of a bustling street in Soho, a humble strike, my hands stop and something determinant like: "so, let us take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even though the heart of Sohos is slowly introduced to his charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where independent seller have been located - there are still a handful of fantastic record stores.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to turn the camera to the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, which I followed by Sister Ray (Dates: two young women, three men middle ages) into the Reckless Records (data number: eight men medium age, a woman, probably around the 20), is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a Collector, I wonder?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I already treasure," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.</seg>
<seg id="17">These soundboards, top left (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I am not followed by e), dress the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he possesses such a considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy plates, which he could not afford to buy them as they appeared, when he was young and plastness.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I Buy, are out of the late 60s, early 70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things, in which I was probably something too young to buy them," he says.</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who are buying, rather introverted and likes to spend alone time and adds: "I don't smoke and I drink not much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my push.</seg>
<seg id="22">Wet, 25, who works at Sister Ray also believes that many customers that he meets on the YouGov's profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, he has also noticed a new wave of people who have heard about the media, people who have heard about the comeback and demonstrate their old records to buy again.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the conversations that I have led, people usually have dismissed so to 1998 or 1999 of their collection.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers that once sold their records to buy themselves, sell their CDs to buy their records again, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom of trailer of the turntable of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the innate emotional meaning of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a shop such as Phonica so as to realize that record stores a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older customers participated in the contactless payments system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record-fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar sound labels, from objects, the happy Jugenderinnings.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think, sometimes it can be the colt of a emptiness or property of material possessions as a kind of consolation," says WEZ.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is my collectors so I think it is with many people so.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like her social workers!" "" "fleills a staff from a platter." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey of ICM in April revealed that nearly 50% of the people who bought a record, they have not heard yet.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey took also out that 41% possess a turntable they never use, whereas 7% of those who buy a record, no turntables.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the message report I would probably be very worried, while I blended by a stacks to Bossa Nova composilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works in the case of sounds of the Universe (including three men in the middle age), has noticed a "trophy of the Revivals" of the Revivals.</seg>
<seg id="39">"" "" "" "someone was recently clean here and said," "" "I have no record player, but I would like to buy a radiohking noise, so I can put them into the shelf," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a great percentage but it is definitely going.</seg>
<seg id="41">More products are blown, less postage.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "we have people who say:" "" "I have no record player." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older, who only slowly rise.</seg>
<seg id="44">Stop, which has devoted to the Schallplatten almost a whole floor, has a blower audience, when I return.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make pictures, teenagers and women middle ages.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even though the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the aforementioned shops - Wild Beasts New andesthesizers - Wild Beasts New thesizers - and the right-packed pop instead of experimental jazz draccustomed from the loudspeakers - it is good to see such a diversity among customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks lonely lonely, but nagging psychical traumas are hard to assert when you stand up next to someone 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, runs around in the shop for some minutes and looks at the variety of plates for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is more of a shovsky over a large purchase.</seg>
<seg id="50">It does not earn much, so the collecting of records is not a real option, she says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to hear music from one computer or to another, but the beauty of plates is... "it drives with a dearable sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it is truly unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said that a new generation of record lovers is to be inspired: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I give the analight, the jeans-Hotpants to patterns, watching a group of young teenagers that grouped for a moment to score polar cameras before a father and daughter hang out to buy a crosley turntable.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left there is a stairwell, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">Nobody sees her - perhaps because they are only purely decorative, some as far above that it is impossible to grasp it.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "art-art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that every attraction for these items mean more money for the industry and some customers might send to the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain.</seg>
<seg id="60">There is no surprise that a population group, which has more time and money than others, the one that is most luxurious, as well as plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even if my research were buried, that the results of YouGov vote, they, at least in record business in Soho, the large number of female collectors and record lovers who exist in reality, record business and in online forforen, unconsidered.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday morning with certainty not with the stroll through record stores, Berwick Street and leaf through plates, while they overlooks the starring of an uncanny, 30-year wrong moderator who rises over the shoulders of the middle aged over the shoulders.</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Britain at the 7-er Rugby came to an abrupt halt at the final hurdle in the final hurdle in the form of Fijis, when they were beaten with a result of 43-7 in the Deodoro Stadium in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji rushed a master class in handling, Side-Stepping, retrospy, liner and raw power to win gold - their first Olympics of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was won by the not too bad Trophy of the Silver medal, Great Britain to this day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they smote New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The marked defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-finals on the same day could fall back to them in the finale.</seg>
<seg id="6">But regardless of it, Fiji would have beaten this form a 15-man team in punishment.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a trost for Britain - but will probably not - that at least a Brite tomorrow will hang a gold medal around his neck: Fijis Cheftrainer Ben Ryan, the former boss for England made of Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">The UK had a difficult path behind it.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago she lost at Ryan every game with the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This bump will wning, but the progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji began wonderful and left the GBs from a lot of fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. when you were going in driving coaches. the World Series-winner went 5-0 to the top, as Osea Kolinisau in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With four minutes of Playtime Jerry Tuwai added another attack out of the right corner that he walked.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB barely got the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A hankraging Tress of Mitchell stops the mountain of man Leone Nakarawa a third gate, but it has Fiji only stopped.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute lete Jasa Veremalua in the right corner a touchdown, and it stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new since the re-poster and there was still over a minute game time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou preached by further weak tacklings of the GB team and turbulent up to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The transformation brought a 29-0 to the break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is so, as if Fiji was born to play the 7, while GB is still seeded.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">The GB caused fundamental changes to the half-time and closed the fijian gap... for whole four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time, until Joshua Tuisova went through to a brilliant mplay of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game ran for a long time in favor of the South African, whose fans sangen heed and danced at the bleachers.</seg>

<seg id="2">There will be no emotene gold than with these games and that wants to be called.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first beak to the last, 220 hard chieving that go into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in its golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even if it was only the dingers, which were at the ruin, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the trainer Robin Williams, was all present as they were at the second Olympics in two without tax-wife, the first women in the history of the British sport, which laid an on such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their dominance was absolutely, after all their scootted untrained use, which is also unparalleled.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant athletes, which flock over the surface with the elegance of swelling which does not reflect the type of triumphes.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind each gold in Ruders is a battalion willing to contribute to the incremental progress that would make the difference and it was no assistant at the same as the coach, who would not survive at all, when he was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said he was risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer, the operiable and this did it.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not, it spread everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a rather hardest situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little bit of view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, beyond the season, could begin to have the interruption to a minimum if that under such circumstances is the right term.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to go back soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in hospital and ran around at the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps were pleasing.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Ruders is already a challenge, but this makes it even greater.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the inmediability of victory went their first thoughts on Williams, who spent a nervenerrolling in the morning to talk about anything more than usual, and thus tried to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">Panning, which was as captain in the Royal Artillery Regiment in a bet in Afghanistan, "I was this week an emotional wreck. this is perhaps something extremely, but it means so much."</seg>
<seg id="22">It only repeated, how much I mean and Helen and Robin worked.</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin, we would be no one, therefore, a massive Thanks to him. he is the best coach of the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I could not have better myself for exercising or better trainers.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have lost no race in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm, with which their opponents were unable to keep up with it.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 meters, when teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to close, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were very caught at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen called "keep in process, lead in the process."</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important to not let it pluck up.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not trying to make some pots.</seg>
<seg id="33">We didn't want a firework, we just wanted to achieve a good result, go out and win the race what we did.</seg>
<seg id="34">The couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about his future.</seg>
<seg id="35">Glover must appear next week at a wedding, their own with the TV-adventurer Steve Backshall.</seg>

<seg id="8">Through regular interiors, seniors can establish social contacts and cultivate them.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because often, dissolve social and family structures at age, a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>

<seg id="28">You don't sings just - at 50 Sinating people who hear who hear when a tone is next to it?</seg>
<seg id="29">In search of the right offer seniors have different possibilities, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">Sing someone from the familiar circle in a senior choir, you can simply connect.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer insights about choirs in the surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="32">Whoever wants to sing in a clesize choir can turn directly to the church or church officers.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many seniors also can be found via the internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Anyone who has no access to the Internet can ask the family, friends or neighbors to help with the Internet.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the middle of the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, as late as it is, there are the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro are feeling resistant and inevitable, a rapid staggering between competition and endeavour.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is, as if the Olympic torch itself would be a burning rod, which is protected from the watchman to float to the trim to the triathleten.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can not place the TV, read a newspaper or listen to the conversation of your neighbours in the queue without talking about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the argument between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there are Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women of black with dimples could have entirely been sent under these known names, which would be sent to Prime Time by sponsors and benefactors, if he would be a swimmers, Turner or even Fgenuine.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fought in the olympic trampoline around gold.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic Flame is not illuminated any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the centre, partly in the shadow are the sports that are not generally recognized: air scare, Archery, badminton, Taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the chest swimming and may it be long reign.</seg>
<seg id="12">But when I should be modest arguments for my particular darling, let me direct the attention to the discrete charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline has already been a olympic event, when it had been in Sydney there was the last 16 years so much noticed that many people I asked, did not know that it is at all an Olympiasportart.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Despite the US Athleten for competition, it has never won a medal in a trampoline and had a athletes, who made it up to the ends.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to divide the prizes for the men and the Chinese and the Kanadier who share the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend its gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline-jumping has a certain outsicharme, partly because it sounds a clowed ear-up for a clowjob than the Olympic Games sound.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a tribborn revelant.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorous potential - the kartoonous trembling of his never to swollen cheers - but also the refinement of the gym and diving, the two sports, which are essentially united.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "Trampoline" comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means as much as "jumping board."</seg>
<seg id="22">Emerging winners jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements (turning, pike and saltos) before they land on the feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">They are evaluated according to official Olympics after the execution, difficulty and "flying time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Two-witnessed athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, are signed in Rio to each other.</seg>
<seg id="25">The common Olympus Vector is almost straight.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists need to go further in their quest for gold, faster, up and beyond, sometimes up to the finish, sometimes back and back, upwards and downwards on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They chase not only the orellinia or the output wall, but also in the television transmission also another catholic goal: the world or the Olympiarekords.</seg>
<seg id="28">The purposeful pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatical - and it is enough to stir even a crowd on tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I imagine in the look of those games as something exhausted.</seg>
<seg id="30">It offers the trampoline a reprieve.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A runtime is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she prallt, seemingly difficult as an astronomer goes down, then downward, then effortlessly back upwards.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also here there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wölden in the distance, but the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It's as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and dustunds of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in the Streaming about 13.00 Eastern Time; which the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the ends as part of an afternoon blocks on 2 days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of the Olympia-Manie, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one which will probably overlook in the general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the raising of consciousness can only be achieved through the Angaffen and the object of male athlete - like it smote the male U.S. gymnasts according to The Wall Street Journal recently - then Mr. Dooley anticipated to rinding his right to air, new banners.</seg>

<seg id="6">In the last ten years it was one of the most stable countries of Africa, a solid bond of West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the last months protests against the government, shaken the country and extended into more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people stormy streets and requested fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The response of the government was unmerciful according to human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses said that policemen were shot at zig unarmed protesters and killed.</seg>
<seg id="11">Emerging videos about the protests, which are probably from last or beginning of this year, how security professionals show young people with staves, while these were forced to make a stand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The leader of the UN High Authority on Human Rights is now required by an incoming study.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to hold this country and will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is a most populated country of Africa and its stability is esteemed by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorism across the region, especially in Somalia. only few countries in Africa, if at all, receive so much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopian Economy is expanding at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">His infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new pendant in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>

<seg id="19">"" "" "" "even if Ethiopia has been anything but a role model for democracy - human rights organizations are continuing the repression through the government - the opposition in the country became restricted, whereby dissidents were effectively addressed to silence." ""</seg>

<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you suppress people and these no other options have out except to protest, it breaks off," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopian.</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from the ground up to the strangling in relation to the power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">"" "" "" "after a widespread election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament." ""</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, the tensions alongside the border to Eritrea; a struggle for this zackable, controversial line requested in June hundreds of life.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts are feared that the separatists such as the Cormo-Liberation Front or the National Coordination Front of the Ogaden, which have been imposed more or less imposed in recent years, the turmoil and can be rearmed.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of the bitterness after years of exposure to the surface can now explode.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems to be harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years have been very many Ethiopia in a position to communicate with social media since more cheap smartphones have been more common and the Internet services improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government does access to Facebook and Twitter, what they are in regular intervals, mainly in protests, doing so many people can still communicate via internet proxies, which conceal where they are staying.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians passed that they gathered so to protest.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnias in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since Äons prosperified the ministers of Amharas, who come from Ethiopia mainly Christian civilizations, in the politics and the economy, while they exploit the Oromos, many of whom are Muslims and living in flat-lands.</seg>
<seg id="37">But also this is changing just.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "we are here to coordinate with a shield," "" "said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests found in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray that dominates around 6 percent of the population and which are dominant in the military, in the intelligence services, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was until his death on a non-profit disease in the year 2012 17 years of Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was regarded as tactical genius, a man who could think of corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts agree that he was particularly versioned to perceive early signs of dissatisfaction and to use special contractor to edit opponents and make them unharmful.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime is lacking in this fundamental skill," "" "said Mr Abdi, a conflict of conflict." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia New Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen relatively unclear reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray Region of the North of Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts agree that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services provided by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time that Ethiopia had lived such a moil in 2005, after thousands of elections protested that according to the information of analyst were seemingly deceived by the government and were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the following sweeps, many protestivities were killed, even if there were less than in the last months and this time of unrest was relatively quickly over.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development of Ethiopia are the leaders for their visionary infrastructural planning, like the new pendant train, as well as for their measurable progress in poverty abatement.</seg>
<seg id="53">But evidently this did not prevent the intensification of the internal mishaunst of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">The last month of the protestivities in Gondar, an amharian city, of Tigray guided shops and the hatred over the tigray becomes more and more extrimental in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts agree that the protests of the US and other Western allies turn into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as a basis for Dronentrips over the neighboured Somalia, even though they recently settled, that it has closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West wants to support democracy, he does not want his allies in an already volatile area.</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his claim, Obama has founded ISIS was "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to dispel the final controversy on Friday the last controversy surfaced his campaign, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the "Founder of Islamic State, not seriously.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "" "" "this clarifications cast new questions to the communication capabilities of the presidential system of Republicans whether he is able to communicate clearly and understandable with the American public." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings its contributors who want to take him during an eventful phase in protection, to explain in the peculiar position, which he could not have been meant to be.</seg>
<seg id="5">After having made the clearing event in an electoral event on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump was back on Thursday and consisted in interviews on that he really did not intend to indicate the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early flat tweet on Friday Mr. Trump, he is simply sarcastically.</seg>
<seg id="7">The tweet was the contrast to the previous day when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he said the accusation perfectly seriously.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative radiomoderator Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump would help to diminish this statement by doing it reminded that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS wanted to know nothing of it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticisms pointed to Mr. Trump, while he tried to guide the focus of his campaign because of falling surveys on the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton kept speeches for the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump tried to return to this topic.</seg>
<seg id="12">Through Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clintons would have suggestions to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already passed sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he passed strong criticism of himself when he said, the Russians should hack Mrs. Clintons of emails, but later he said, "Natürlich" said the sarcastically. "</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to shift the language boundaries in politics and then return to veins.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of its methods to test how certain messages of his fans will be recorded as they arrive, and then if necessary," according to how the reaction falls. "said Ruth Dallas, a communications approach, which observed the language of both candidates.</seg>
<seg id="17">But I also think he is clever enough to keep his information vague enough so that they can be interpreted in a variety of ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of sharpening the sound for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has an even estimable note, since its surveys have further declined.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey of NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist who was published on Friday showed a guided tour with great lead in the federal states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">During Mr. Trump in general, he is not trying to apologize for his provocal statements, he acculted his critics to distort his statements or to understand his humour.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he is strengthening the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps Scherze has brought his loyal fellow whites to the unconvenient situation, regardless of how provocant his statements also may be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former Mayor of New York and one of the most prominent teachers, gave himself great difficulty to defend the candidates today in an CNN interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments" "" "said Mr. Giuliani he was asked to the correctness of Mr. Trumps statements whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in this sense that Obama ISIS was almost unknown, small organization, he called them back-darker, completely wrong and therefore it happened because he moved the troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most mainstream republicans try to argue that the government served under Obama as the Foreign Minister, it was ISIS allowed to spread themselves to spread the situation in the Middle East aggressive under control.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and cast them before, on each of his words, and against him were prest.</seg>
<seg id="27">He misunderstood the "poor, jämmerable" TV expert, who try to understand and said, "You Can't!"</seg>

<seg id="2">In March 1933, shortly after his ascent to the president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch in the Oval Office.</seg>
<seg id="3">As gourmets, President Roosevelt had a Faible for refined Delikatessen the Fifth Avenue such as Pâte de foie gras and Maryland watertortie soup.</seg>
<seg id="4">Its menu on that day was a bit modest: cored eggs in Tomatensauce, mashed Potatoes and as dessert a plums.</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was an act of culinary solidarity with the people," said Jane Ziegelman.</seg>
<seg id="6">Her husband, Andrew Coe added, "There was also a message to the Americans like they should eat."</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both groceries.</seg>
<seg id="8">Coes's book "Chop Suey," acted from Chinese cuisine in the USA, while Ziegelman tells in her book "97 Orchard" about living in a residential house at the Lower East Side from the food perspective.</seg>
<seg id="9">Your latest collaboration, "A decent meal" which will appear on Tuesday at the Harper Verlag, illustrated the history of American cuisine while the Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="10">They showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a reporter at the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, snowkellosem Imbiss at the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the stock market in 1929.</seg>

<seg id="25">Meats, which was for years the center of the American cuisine, became a rare luxury.</seg>

<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return after an examination on board the schizship Sanna into the sea.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floats with a good 1 km / h through Nordatlantik - until today.</seg>

<seg id="8">Only when it comes down, the five meters long animal accelerates at satte 2,6 km / h - and is half as fast as a Robbe.</seg>
<seg id="9">This kind of loneliness lifestyle does not seem to be a godparent for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the Fachzeitschrift (Science ") of a Greenland, the 392 year old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "madness" "", "commented Alexander Scheuerlein vom Max-Planck-Institut für demographic Research in Rostock this category-span, which means for whales a world record." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Indeed, the evolutionary biologist already long that Greenland is rock-old.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only lacked the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">Grönland haie are difficult to observe, eventually they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the thin coast from Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they mostly appear on the surface mostly in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">About the lifestyle of Greenland researchers know accordingly little.</seg>
<seg id="17">Your time-pentagono corn starters them, when they hide six animals with a transmitter.</seg>
<seg id="18">Booty, this sharks still make: in the stomach of a beast, researchers found the remains of a Robbe, another had swallowed the pendant of a young skovary.</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly chase them sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the icmeeres and are looking for Kadasses, which stem from higher water layers down.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 from Greenland or Svalbard as the catch of the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 cm long, while the largest 502 centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="22">To assess the age of the animals, analysed them with the carbon-14 method the lens of sharks.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eyeeyelet has already been created before the birth of the haie, that the proteins are later no longer redone.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had been strikingly much carbon-14 in the lens.</seg>
<seg id="25">Your birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s as nuclear-consuming large amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the length of 220 centimeters, the third smallest animal sheds light on the other hand a low overshot of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapon-14, it is likely to have celebrated his 50th birthday in 2012 with its investigation in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All larger Grönland had in its lens with the normal carbon-14 quantities which arises from cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">Actually the Carbon-14-watch was shown for a 493 centimeters long Greenland an age of 335 years, while the record-shark with 502 centimeters even 392 years old might be.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland females only then get offspring when they are longer than four meters was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers of the length could classify an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters well was probably on the threshold to the sexual ripe and his age with 156 years was determined, Grönland-haty with the multiply obviously at least one-half centuries time.</seg>
<seg id="32">Also this is likely to be a world record for whiriots.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusaleme live above all in eisigen waters is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also the previous record holder, a 211 years old Grönland, in whose speck at the neck, a 120 year old Harley-pointed proach, was imprisoned before Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures often the organism of the animals living there are also rideflames.</seg>
<seg id="36">They attack then slowly - and slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep itself warm in cold water, the animals are often particularly large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, by which the animal gets heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss from one gram mouse is therefore much greater than in one gram of an Elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">An additional advantage: you have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "a lesser animal lives in hazardous areas and should focus on focusing on as many descendants as possible as possible," "", "explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein." ""</seg>

<seg id="15">But even with the little chance that Ms. Jenner - described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of their generation - under the former category it falls, it is in good company.</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or youths today, who know how to get a good Snapchat video (even if everything depends on jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are truly talented women who are reflected in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce, which appeared on the last cover, had with the release of Lemonade, one of the most successful years of her career.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Venus was probably inhabited according to the projections of a new NASA climate model, probably inhabited.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies at the NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus with tools and algorithms that resembles those of climate scientists.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot, water-free surface and CO2-dense atmosphere once have occurred.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously pointed out that the slow turn of Venus can be explained by her dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation suggests that the Venus could have had a thin, unstable atmosphere and nevertheless slowly moved.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the Topology of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably pointed more dry areas than de earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to face life and to face faster rejuvenation.</seg>

<seg id="12">The result are average temperatures that are some degree of cooler than that of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought forth a history of Venus that was similar to evolution that has been realised previously by Planetary researchers.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although they were supposed to be inhabited once, the Venus -- in the course of more than billions years --was exposed to much heat and ultraviolet light.</seg>

<seg id="1">Data export: so perfide erpresses hackers for their soluble</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmailing-malware currently hold targeted companies - and they are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a current survey of the Malware Subway specialists of Malwarebytes, under 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the inquired companies in the past twelve months have at least once, partly several victims of an attack with presser software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany almost 20 percent of companies already reached the target of a Ransomware blackmailing.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of victims paid by the perpetrators of the perpetrators of the challenged systems and data to be used again.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize their presser software according to the observations of Malwarebytes to attacks on attacks in corporate networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potential to pressuring ransom is significantly higher than in private use.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "we currently observe a frightening fast evolution of harm software," "" "explains Malwarebytes chef," "" "Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the" "" "world" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008 most Malwareprograms were still designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then we discovered the perpetrators of the pressors.</seg>
<seg id="11">First of all, private users were the target, but the change to company attacking was rapidly coming into the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once on the computer of an offering, it searches for unlong changed files such as Word-, exterior or database files as well as archives of pictures and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypted the Ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then the software presents the demands of the presser.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the final turnkey code to the files, the victims need money - mostly in the form of Cryptowing Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, where the personal photo database is at stake, it's about sensitive customer data or project databases without which the production is silent.</seg>
<seg id="17">Consequently, higher is the damage when a Ransomware is defeated.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of the affected German firms involved increase by Ransomware, 13 percent even had to break the business activity completely, in case of a case people were living in life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany several times, hospitals were victims of attacks whose patients may be threatened by loss of sickness.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we say the victims still: is not paying, it only promotes the problem," "" "explains Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">However, 80 to 90 percent of companies paid, get their data back.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers it is difficult, given to a standstill at the operation the demand of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers are again aware of this and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study the safety forscher from F-Secure the user area examined and get in contact with the pressures and come to the result: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of client service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">You declare your sacrifices per chat, as they can pay by Bitcoin, freely accessible support websites, or inconclusive example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And will redeem individuals after payments from a few hundredly euros, businesses have to pay partly tough and five-digit vines to redeem their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">Given the potentially high and relatively low risk gains from the Ransomware blackmailing, the hacker will always be professional and share the work, explains the security sexually chniewski from the Antivirus-provider Sophos: "a single person can write a Ransomware roughly within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">But it is more probable that it is three or four people.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their claim software then in the form of a software construction at the actual presser.</seg>
<seg id="30">The previous Malware kit was created by malware, advice and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1,000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "they included a adaptation tool, so that smaller configurations, look and branding can be changed," "" "says Wisniewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">The presser are then looking for more hackers to spread the purchased software under the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We are living in a service sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">You log in to one of the forums in the underground, buys the set of a criminal and asked another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment will be made per unauthorised calculator.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually professing the crime then spammer with the spread," explains Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known by many companies that better ensure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 percent of companies active in the Malwarebytes survey trust that Ransomware is able to honor pansomware using file-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators already follow new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful earnings, the perpetrators will stop with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing," "" "explains Malwarebytes-Chef" "" "Marcin Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">With this, the potential for damage, depending on the type of data, the potential damage is higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">They could also take the perpetrators in the future completely new goals on the internet of things.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the HackerConference Defcon demonstrates security forscher, as they could have received the thermostat under its control under the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter the release of such a type block heating could certainly not be a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators then block instead of the heating in the future can block an entire production road in a factory, Ransomware could be a topic in the Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the evening, one walks around eternally, at night one is no longer awake in the morning, and in the morning it is quite far to think about sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, you have such problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch-Institute, about one quarter of adults's sleep disorders, and more than ten percent feel frequent or permanent as not relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be many causes underlying them, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weran, Executive Board of the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Schlafforeption und Schlafmedizin.</seg>
<seg id="7">What one understands it, but the insomnever, therefore has an input and sleep.</seg>
<seg id="8">Just that undergo many people as unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, Executive board member of the German household association with practice in the semi-Saxon Varel.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind it, organic, mental or detrimental factors, but also medications are stuck.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not rarely is the sleep expression of another disorder.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early awakening is mostly with depression often," "" "said Weathered." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors need each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">Whoever has for example a Bandy prefall, can be bad, wacht every two to three hours and blurged much to bassing about all-day problems and make sure you get an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">From when should one be with sleep disorders to the doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">Those who were not asleep over for a period of one month to at least three nights per week and affected the day should go to the doctor, betrayal wethed.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can be completely different: one is beaten, tired, infired, has difficulty with attention and concentration, is easily viable, has moods or bodily discomfort such as stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">To relieve the sleep, it is important to find their causes out.</seg>
<seg id="21">As a treatment options include behaviour change, a cognitive behavioural therapy or even drugs - classic double-coated only in exceptional cases and no more for two weeks - inquery.</seg>
<seg id="22">Approved Schlafes gibt es in Deutschland hardly, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, Head of the Interdisciplinary Research Centre of the Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore one should first turn into sleeping buries initially at the veterinarian, being wethed.</seg>
<seg id="24">It can be clarified by examining whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should do in bed laboratory, and what happens there?</seg>
<seg id="26">For examination in the sleeping laboratory, medicine for example with snoring with respiratory disorders, in case of illness-fatigue, or if you do not find the cause of a stackage, explains fever.</seg>
<seg id="27">We do not need to prepare for the study.</seg>
<seg id="28">We should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "only please do not take a midday sheep," "" "says Fietze." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">After the wiring, one gets to his normal time in bed.</seg>
<seg id="31">In addition to the electrodes in the body one bears a Nasenbrille, a chest strap, and a antennae of the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">There is also a camera on the ceiling ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can sufferers who deal with the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of adjusting screws that one can set for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Weran counts at: regular bedtime and time-offs, not too long in bed, do not sleep on the day, do not watch TV away on the clock - then you will not be able to look at the clock - then you start immediately to be counted immediately, and that's quite tight.</seg>

<seg id="1">Altars, a few Lindenbäumchen, inter alia, a rest headache street: the Rigaer Strasse in Berlin-Friedrichshain appears at first sight not so, but the police is one of the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you walk along the road from east to west, one comes to playsites, a frescoded kindergarten and a biolades.</seg>
<seg id="3">To the facade of a gray house someone has "ugly!" salted. "</seg>
<seg id="4">Opposite to a Lidl, who will soon be demolished, will be built: until 2017 there is a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments.</seg>
<seg id="5">Article about this "trenant district" as the competent property of Friedrichshain is known in the last few weeks, but usually preferred by burning cars.</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile have the residents of leasing, but on the ground floor are still spaces occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Especially the Berlin Insenator Henkel had been repeatedly referred to the police since the beginning of the year for a hard procedure of police against the project, the area called "no-Go-Zone" for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">After 22 June the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, were cleared with 300 police officers, patrol the police three weeks later, according to 30 to 40 officials and three teams wagons on site, donated parts of the street and kept visitors from being able to enter the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, renovated construction workers on behalf of the unknown landowners the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin State Court decided that the clearance was illegal, and a day later police and builders were under the Jubel from sympathizers and inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="11">At this Sommernachafternoon the road is peaceful: parents walk with children, people sitting on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others talking about Späti.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the hotel projects, there are a basic school and nursery.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left violence is not the main interests of many councils: Kerstin Neugebauer, who since 1999 lives in the Kiez, and Jana * found here three children are mostly run by the police force.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the hood projects they share the care of rising miets and idolfication.</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not sound like a Kiez that is mostly afraid of the police violence against vandalious left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ditch, which the Berliner intersenator and the police between homework and their neighbors, exists so apparently not.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working class, which is also a low average class today as compared to the rest of the city a low average.</seg>
<seg id="18">Also homework and the consequential dormitories includes a long time to the Kiez: in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainzer Straße just close to the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer was cleared under large police officers, many of the projects were legalized in the rigs and are still inhabited by the people still occupied by the people whom they had occupied over 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the quarter in recent years has increasingly become the magnet for tourists and electorers from all over the world, with them now they share their grandchildren from GDR times and former property.</seg>
<seg id="21">This also noticeable in the mieten, which since 2009 have risen by nearly 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the newbuildings in the Rigaers are attacked as symbols for this development: one recognizes them in worshifted disks or fresh straighted facades produced with colouring.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other street was mentioned so often together with the words "lefksautonome violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason that not all neighbours see this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by the crime: offences such as bodily violates are estimated to be almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most part of the offences make Sachsenals, the tendenial rather the newbuildings and newly renovated homes meet.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a sandhouse next to the controversial 94, cannot be talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">What is nonviolence is it weighting: the people in the 94 are their neighbours, which they have not been determined.</seg>
<seg id="28">Also the famous burning cars give it directly in the Rigaer for longer no longer.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the studied architecologist, her street is not a criminal burning, on the contrary, "here one helps each other, lives together on the street and gets more of each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is deliberately drawn into the rigs street - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">That's why it was also so important that the inhabitants have returned its road: from the police, politics and the media, which suddenly became the German-house across the district in July.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of inhabitants like Neugebauer will continue to take away the street, by characterless new built in the former buildings, which impose the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"that's not all the condominium that are not interesting for many here - here are more people who are not so well worth it," she says.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "force and destruction can I absolutely do." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what to do, if someone never listen to someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">Standing on all sides frustration, even with the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">For Zugezogens present on colour bombs, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the front-projects and the left-wing scene belonged to the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">Whower moves, should be aware of it - just like anyone who draws in a pub, where bad can complain about any noise.</seg>
<seg id="39">All persons named only with first names have asked to be called not to name with their right name</seg>

<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact partner for integrating and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">Furthermore, she is a social worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July Annika Deuschle is the refugee officer for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Sozialpedagogin supports the team of management of Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "she sees himself as a contact for all actors: refugees, labour, refugee camps, administrations, authorities and who else is misunderstood." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine Client from the Arbeitskreis indicates that the volunteer is more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the eierlegende Wollmilchsau, which above all a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">That's how some - less spottingly than in the multitude of tasks are focused, targeted, when managing the site wanted to leave.</seg>
<seg id="9">A administration was chosen by a talent for languages and people, combined with many years of experience in the field of social work, just an eierlegende Wollmilchsau.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not its central area, means Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organization, work with the local people and also behind the scenes and network overactivity.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been here for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50-percent position on three years of extension.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," says Regine customer, that Annika Deuschle honors and full-party actors support.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are large and small problems, organisational, human and understanding.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon, new container are available at the Wasp</seg>
<seg id="17">A serious problem is it for some time, apartments for the connecting-refugees have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">For the connection, the municipalities are responsible.</seg>
<seg id="19">You need to store refugees in their own or rented living rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The cost of construction, the rent or the renovation of these properties must carry the municipalities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the bureau to commune and job center.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlords wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">For some time the search has been very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto find the management of no private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">It does not work so far so that you rely on private apartments, so deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, most common apartments must be sweetened, as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers are placed in the Wasp.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, are Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a fixed benleibe, it interns training courses, training courses, A-euro jobs and sanitation for refugees and migrants that have to be folded or furnished.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reported Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the Bauhof or help dosms, do non-profit work - and the motivates and very neat, such as Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community is leading to a positive overall effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "that is" "" "no employment therapy." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "but not just work." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">The day you need a fixed structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a pergation.</seg>
<seg id="38">Well, it offers offers like sport, contacts with locals and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rar.</seg>
<seg id="40">So, we also jump here management and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that refugees get the feeling they are in Germany welcome and welcome.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "" "" "they must explain the refugees that it just takes and they can be able to personize the time, for example with language courses." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">Who eventually develop the feeling, he could not do anyone else in Urbach, would not work to work and be unnütz, which will never be integrated.</seg>
<seg id="45">The distinct majority should be motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"" "but problems are also," "" "people honestly," "" "people, at which nothing is going" "". "the work of Deuschle and customer may therefore always be motivate others." ""</seg>
<seg id="47">"" "that is all already a" "" "mammoth task" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: did the two of the recent occurrences fear of radicalization, also in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," Regine Client says quite clearly, "what mancher naive do." a remainder cannot and if it does not want to exclude it.</seg>
<seg id="50">Insensized the helpers were already.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the attacks put them complete in revocation.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine Customer.</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So must be the main and honorary staff on site and in the region to its activities tenau.</seg>
<seg id="56">In doing so, they have always been in the background that soon a new thine could come to refugees and migrants to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">This question clearly to answer, seut the policy.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually, it is unfair to put them on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we are not yet arrived, where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees that would be able to relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine Client also makes it clear that the Urbacher also has been extensively integrated with previous people.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 people, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in need to help them, both women are united.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complex, there is no simple answers.</seg>
