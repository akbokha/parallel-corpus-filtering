Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not very friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as about Teh@@ ran@@ ics dest@@ abil@@ ising action in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , at the meeting , it is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the argu@@ ed two @-@ state solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for many years .
Washington critic@@ ises the ongoing settlement of Israel and thro@@ ws Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of peace in the peace process .
in the deal of Obama &apos;s deal with the Iranian nuclear programme , the relationship between the two is still deteri@@ or@@ ated .
in March Net@@ any@@ ahu announced at the invitation of Republi@@ cans before the US Congress held a contro@@ versi@@ al speech which was partly founded as an aff@@ ront to Obama .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with regard to the election of the election in Israel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in an emergency call , Professor , his girlfriend have shot
in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb with a slightly z@@ itt@@ y voice of the police that he shot his girlfriend and that officials would have to come to his home .
it was important to empha@@ size that his &quot; cute dog &quot; but still live and probably excited , and he said that the family contacted the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone .
inside the house the officials were des@@ ks of Amy Pr@@ ism and a hand@@ written not@@ ing that was on a white block , I just wanted to do it , I loved her ... and she &apos;s the only wife that has ever loved . &apos; this was according to particulars of the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that he was travelling in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ veland , Mississippi , where he has travelled 300 miles to the school grounds , where he was shot and killed on the door at his office .
Delta State University Poli@@ v@@ ä@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that Hamburg Süd employees have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that he did not take the p@@ im@@ ous not@@ ing at some point then .
until the end of the day there was another death : Lamb took life , when the police picked him .
one day after shooting the shooting at the University , the students and l@@ ect@@ ur@@ ers to hide themselves behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get an idea of what he motiv@@ ates .
those of the issu@@ ers at both ends of the state published details , as well as what students and employees , who knew him , helped us , a picture by a talented but potentially difficult teacher to draw .
and they said they were happy in their teaching .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ us@@ ss died , he said , he did not have history of violence or a criminal occurrence .
he himself had mentioned a written reference in one of him , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his ak@@ ade@@ mat@@ ory life .
both subordin@@ ates in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty members are 17 members , and many students visited courses of both .
at the same time there were some incl@@ inations to be problematic .
a student , Bran@@ don Be@@ a , the Lamb &apos;s pra@@ ised , he said he was also a little excited , and ed@@ gy , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes said that she told him that he had told him at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 with stress .
he previously had the Delta State University in order to be asked for a pre @-@ eye for health reasons and said that he did something health problems .
this year he organised only two online @-@ courses .
recent changes in the Employment policies of the University , meant that the promotion had worked so hard for which he had no guarantee for an automatic journey to a position as assistant Manager .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Universal President William LA@@ FOR@@ GE said he did not know anything from a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that did not answer any more .
after the flight from the campus , the police took later the lam@@ bs , as he turns again into Mississippi from Ark@@ ans@@ as .
before it could be arrested wi@@ dened with an .@@ 38 cali@@ ber Pist@@ as in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents , on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , Washington County Cor@@ oner meth@@ ane Johnson .
his car ran still in the dri@@ v@@ eway .
it was not immediately clear why Lamb at this house went , but Johnson said that she knew that he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb &apos;s grew in the area .
in 2009 , he began his work at the University , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with approximately 12,@@ 000 inhabitants , and taught geography and ped@@ ago@@ gic .
he rehear@@ sed in the spring in ped@@ ago@@ gic .
one of the long @-@ standing friend@@ ships suffered him as intelligent , char@@ ism@@ atic and funny .
Carla H@@ air@@ ston said , she was 15 and Lamb was 20 , when they met together by common friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool former guy who tried several years to teach you the guitar game .
he was at the time of the women &apos;s black .
all girls mol@@ ten thi@@ ther , when he was there , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson Vor@@ stadt of Bran@@ don inhabitants .
Lamb and Pr@@ us@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the call , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate of a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house , which is adjacent to a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of pron@@ u@@ ters , Sha@@ awn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said , they have stayed 15 years ago , but friends stayed there and a daughter who had been 19 years old now .
&quot; she was totally destroyed on the floor , &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said about his daughter .
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , he did never hit , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that he was interested in music and blues .
he met Pr@@ us@@ ss , when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail stood before three years ago both during a summer fair .
later they played together one or the other Gi@@ g .
o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and s@@ ings her own music .
Pr@@ ism was a nur@@ se that worked for different companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a b@@ aker and sometimes entertainment coordin@@ ator at The Jul@@ ep Room , a weak illumin@@ ated bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he Lamb and Pr@@ us@@ ss Night finished in the night 5 September to the last time , after he finished his gu@@ itar@@ ist and harmon@@ ica game .
there was no evidence that anything un@@ voting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just a happy pair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were at the clean@@ up and j@@ ok@@ ing with each other .
I mean , they both had a good sense of joke .
Schmidt , the total Professor , leading the sem@@ esters conference programme and specialized in American U@@ cle@@ ans and Col@@ onial history , said Don All@@ an Mitch@@ ell , a English @-@ professor at the school .
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in Kan@@ sas and was President of his Bro@@ therhood and Stu@@ dents .
on Tuesday night campus in Cle@@ veland took part in the Tuesday evening about 900 people , including l@@ ect@@ ur@@ ers , staff , students and members of the community at a cand@@ l@@ el@@ ight commemor@@ ative ceremony .

the lessons will be taken on Wednesday again .
&quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; said LA@@ FOR@@ GE .
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Rog@@ el@@ io Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ veland , Mississippi .
Associ@@ ated Press authors Em@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans carried away this report .
this story has been corrected to re@@ lie@@ ve that the police already pointed out that he made the emergency , and that Lamb was shot in his staves as his wife , but there is no indication that the two ever married .

UN Chief says , there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General Ban Ki @-@ Moon says , its response to Russia increased military support for Syria : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of almost five years of di@@ lu@@ sted conflict , and more weapons will wor@@ sen force and mis@@ ery for millions of people .
the UN leader once again demands all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and supporting inclusive negotiations on finding a political solution .
Ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he is planning to discuss the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the br@@ ink of the General Assembly nor in this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he regret that the inter@@ f@@ ations of the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation un@@ solu@@ ble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in cop@@ ing with the crisis in Syria , which they proved to be demonstrated with Iran in achieving nuclear power .
8 surveys to show that Donald Tr@@ ump is seriously to take .
some have tried to brand@@ name him as a flop to brand @-@ brand .
others have done it as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
but no matter how some Republi@@ cans try to drag Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks of surveys , it has not yet worked .
ten of the last eleven national surveys revealed Donald Tr@@ ump in the two @-@ digit range , and some begin to ask themselves to ask what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of real estate .
of course , it is still too early in the election period .
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump will probably be able to win the re@@ publi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts emphas@@ ise that at that time in 2011 R@@ ick Per@@ r@@ ys &apos;s leadership has been given to rising Herman C@@ ain , none of which does not only win a state at the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ shell @-@ groups such as J@@ eb Bush &apos;s Super P@@ AC and the conserv@@ ative economic group Club for Growth recogni@@ zes the umps being able to let her dollars will flow to overthrow him .
here are some current transform@@ ations that indicate that the real estate @-@ Mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
Tr@@ umps Beli@@ aps values have around 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced its can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University showed that only two out of ten re@@ public@@ ans have had a positive outlook .
by mid July there were 40 percent .
at the beginning of August there were 52 per cent .
now , six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three of ten say that they have a negative opinion .
and these numbers keep in the early States .
a Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa has found last week that 60 percent of the Republi@@ can have a good idea of ump .
two @-@ thirds of the GO@@ P voters would be happy with cl@@ ump than candidates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week 67 percent of Republi@@ cans , they would be either &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thrilled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if tr@@ ump was nominated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only two of 10 say they would be &quot; angry &quot; if he would be the candidate .
only Ben Car@@ son will generate about the same enthusiasm like Tr@@ ump ( 43 per cent , they would be &quot; enthusiastic &quot; vs. 40 per cent , who say the same about ump ) .
the next in enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand 47 per cent of the Republi@@ can voters that they were &quot; un@@ happy &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the Favor@@ ite of the Est@@ abl@@ ishment , the candidate would go .
a majority of Republi@@ cans sees tears @-@ temper@@ ament not as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is deliber@@ ately critic@@ ised for its bom@@ bas@@ tic and v@@ ei@@ ved statements , 52 percent of those who have noted the real temper@@ ament for a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is in the first pre @-@ elect@@ oral state of the nation , the federal state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the re@@ public@@ ans think that he has the personality for an upper failed , according to Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent , that he did not have the personality to run effectively his ministry , and almost six out of 10 inde@@ pen@@ dents say that his temper@@ ament does not adapt to the White House , N@@ BC / Post .
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
when they put their schol@@ ars , keep the Republi@@ can voters of a real .
if they are asked to win the GO@@ P &apos;s nom@@ ination , say after a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week four out of ten that ch@@ ump is the best bet .
that is a change since the date of holding four out of the end of July to put their money on th@@ ief Bush .
complete disclosure : GO@@ P voters in the past did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball .
at this time in the last cycle , four out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans that R@@ ick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination for only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , it shows that a large number of GO@@ P @-@ voters d@@ umps can be seen as pl@@ au@@ si@@ bly .
even if the re@@ public@@ ans gathered around a different candidate , Tr@@ ump is still going to beat almost everybody .
some experts suggest that the sh@@ atter@@ proof field is likely to contribute to the umps guide , while the anti @-@ cl@@ ump support is distributed to more than a do@@ zen of other candidates .
but a survey of the Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ in @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , tr@@ ump multi @-@ embr@@ ac@@ ing support .
he hat from Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points rap@@ e , in front of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before the edge Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it is a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who proposes it ?
Ben Car@@ son would bring the entrepreneurs with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head race .
a b@@ ump majority of Donald @-@ Tr@@ ump @-@ fans say that they have formed their mind .
a new survey of C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters want to support the ump , say they have awarded their votes .
of course , a lot of things can happen to change that , and no one can truly say , never change the opinion .
46 per cent said that they open the door to switch to other candidates .
nonetheless , the m@@ umps are the strongest competition at the moment of other out@@ sider , the neuro@@ sur@@ geon Ben Car@@ son , but voters that they have formed their minds are twice as frequent for ump .
six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say that they are agre@@ eing with wo@@ ke on the issue of immigration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump in his elect@@ oral campaign was faced by Mexico &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rap@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; was the immigration and ful@@ crum point in public dis@@ course . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ bas@@ tic manifest@@ ations of tr@@ ump are stepp@@ ing out of the Republi@@ can party and le@@ verage the new @-@ oriented efforts .
but after the new ABC / Post @-@ survey of Monday , six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans that they are agre@@ eing with tr@@ ump in issues of immigration .
until so long the immigration in the lim@@ el@@ ight remain hidden , it will seem to do Donald Tr@@ ump .
the fru@@ stration on the government climb@@ s to new levels .
at Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , meanwhile , around half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , especially through their out@@ sider status .
six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say in the new Mont@@ ags of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider as someone with government experience .
and they are also angry in Washington .
a survey of Des Mo@@ ines Register / Bloom@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa @-@ Republi@@ cans are frustr@@ ated by 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; polite . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five exclusive dormit@@ ories of Germany

a new study shows in which special lum@@ ens cost a square meter on most .
of course 18,@@ 70 Euro per square meter for one student hostel in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany Top locations , one of the prize is like Pe@@ anu@@ ts .

but Bavaria , in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up @-@ du@@ els with Greek teams did not want to be the next victim .
they went from cour@@ ageous , in their obvious efforts are often too mon@@ om@@ less to work .
the attacks were too often initiated by playing on left Douglas Costa , which was rarely en@@ ched against the earlier brown Br@@ uns@@ wick Om@@ ar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck from the right side than its flan@@ k from the right half @-@ field in the left upper to@@ re@@ ck .
in the 6@@ 7 minute the World Champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .

who consuming , has a higher risk to lose teeth
wh@@ o@@ ever consuming , l@@ itt@@ y not just the l@@ ungs , but also the teeth - this places a Pots@@ damer @-@ long @-@ term study .
the good news : at del@@ zi@@ cht the risk is rapidly .
smo@@ kers have a clearly increased risk to lose their teeth early .
this results from long @-@ term study of an international research teams , including several employees of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .

for these par@@ od@@ on@@ ti@@ tis smoking a risk factor , empha@@ size the authors .
the connection between smoking and tooth loss are therefore based on frequ@@ enting g@@ ums in smoking .
not be clari@@ fied , however , smoking also increases the risk of c@@ aries .
people who list@@ ened to smoking could reduce their risk but within a short time , writing the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
it would only take ten years before the endang@@ ering to the level of non @-@ smoking , the Fir@@ st@@ or Thomas Dietrich von the English University of Birmingham .

they are supposed to come to equal parts of the EU , the US and third countries .
this is intended for the first time also a second instance .
it would allow it to raise against jud@@ g@@ ments .
so far the proc@@ ed@@ ural involved refer to the arbit@@ rat@@ ors , a contradiction against their jud@@ g@@ ments .
in the discussion of the past months , it became clear that citizens of the old IS@@ DS system are not familiar with the old IS@@ DS system in terms of fair@@ ness and justice .
in the long term , she wants to work for her own personal information on the International Court of Justice .
you may also be clari@@ fied between Chinese companies and EU states for example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration requested ( IS@@ DS ) above all are regarded as one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the traditional arbit@@ rat@@ ors are cri@@ tici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parallel adju@@ sting , over the company damages to tax@@ pay@@ ers , national laws , or a reduction of consumer and environmental standards .
in first statements , Anti @-@ TTIP @-@ organizations such as Camp@@ act were the proposals of the European Commission as in@@ adequate .
cri@@ tici@@ zes that they are not intended for the already negoti@@ ated free trade agreement with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) .
the German economic secret@@ ary Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) followed the plans as a great progress .
the Commission considered essential points for the reform of the European Economic Department Sig@@ mar Gabriel at the spring with other EU @-@ trade ministers .
the old system of private arbit@@ ral tri@@ bun@@ als is from the table .
also the French government welcomed the plans of Malm@@ strö@@ m .
the European company association BUS@@ IN@@ ES@@ S@@ EURO@@ PE war@@ ned that the cl@@ ue of economy forces to restrict the economy by too many new rules .
especially small and medium @-@ sized companies could be dis@@ advant@@ aged , it was meant to be .
when the talks about the free trade agreements TTIP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) was going to have continued un@@ clear on Wednesday .
the negotiations have been running since mid 2013 .
however , the subject of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the USA .
originally a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year .
this date is no longer acceptable .

Jer@@ emy Cor@@ by@@ n debut at the frag@@ ments of the Prime Minister
since his election Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the frag@@ ment of the Prime Minister is expecting an tension
the new Labour Party Jer@@ emy Cor@@ by@@ n should be his debut at the frag@@ ments of the Prime Minister and took place to David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n is committed to putting the first his six pre @-@ ordin@@ ated questions shortly after noon , carrying out his performance by the media probably and the Labour Party .
he called for less theat@@ res and more facts &quot; on this weekly event .
he also said that he can ski@@ p some sessions to leave them to colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as it comes to his appointment as a member of the Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ ab@@ in@@ etts and after his speech at the Tu@@ c Annual Meeting .
meanwhile the decision of the Labour Party , on Tuesday during the singing of the national hybrid at a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5. anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , be prov@@ oked by a number of T@@ ory @-@ MP@@ S and is at the heart of several front Stories Stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision , not to sing the national hy@@ m@@ ne , has drawn attention on itself
a spok@@ es@@ person by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had been &quot; respect@@ ful of silence , &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; Hel@@ dent@@ um of the Royal Air Force in the aviation . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ ab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told in the BBC Two News@@ night program , he got to sing the Labour Party , the National hy@@ m@@ ne , regardless of his belief that the mon@@ archy should be abol@@ ished .
nearly a do@@ zen of shadows @-@ ministers have ref@@ used to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s l@@ ament , and they refer to differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a Six@@ th of the Par@@ ish Party originally supported it as a guide .
the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences should also be st@@ ack@@ able within the Labour Party , namely to Mr Cor@@ by@@ n statements about the role of the European Union and the limit of winn@@ ings .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the Tu@@ c Conference that Labour will put changes in order to remove the whole idea of a limitation overall .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ working and pensions minister that the party &quot; is very clear &quot; that they only viol@@ ate the government plans to reduce the limit of 26,@@ 000 £ to 23.@@ 000 £ !
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour Party , the David Cameron , since then he has been T@@ ory boss , across the last decade across the Dis@@ patch Box .
the Labour Chairman , which promised a different policy approach , says that he has given &quot; Cro@@ w@@ d @-@ s@@ our@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr. Cameron and gave him more than 3@@ 0,000 suggestions .
the Isl@@ ington North MP said that the frag@@ ments of the prime minister is to con@@ front@@ line , and that he has under@@ gone both of &quot; impact strength &apos; and stri@@ ves to focus on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angela Eagle , the shadow ta@@ vern@@ s will represent him , if he is not participating - for example if Mr. Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally sei@@ ze the Word and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the spok@@ es@@ person of the house , addressed to discuss the issue .
when he became the guide in 2005 , Mr Cameron that he wants to remove himself from the policy in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le &quot; theater , who is often linked with the frag@@ ments of the Prime Minister . however , a few years later he sp@@ elled that he failed .
since she was sent out on TV first in 1990 , the question was regarded by the Prime Minister as the most important bar@@ ometer by the jud@@ ging of a leader and his lead in the under@@ haus and his position under his parliament , although critics ar@@ gues that they become a car@@ ic@@ ature and so@@ jour@@ ned reform .

Po@@ unds increases through acceler@@ ated wage growth in the United Kingdom
the pound rather rose @-@ like after data that show an increase in the wage growth of the United Kingdom . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the Geb@@ ot@@ s@@ ziel SA@@ BM@@ iller .
between May and July the result without bonuses increased in the United Kingdom to 2.9 % compared to the same period of the previous year .
this percentage had been the fastest and increased assess@@ ments on the time of a interest rate .
Po@@ unds rose by more than 1 % compared to the dollar on $ 1,@@ 55@@ 05 and was clim@@ bed up to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the euro on 1,@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 index rated with an increase of 41 % to 6.@@ 22@@ 9.@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share in the market and made a leap of 20 % after taking over @-@ offering of the Rival AB In@@ v .
a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ w@@ eries in the world and brands such as Bud@@ be@@ ers , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
Bur@@ berry @-@ shares were after encouraging messages from the competition company for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont 0.9 % higher .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures show up all expectations and also showed that sales in China is a key market for Bur@@ berry and again growth .
shares of Gl@@ enc@@ ore rose by 5 % , after the mines , he said 2.5 billion by a share sale as part of his strategy of debt .
the shares of Packaging and pap@@ er@@ work MON@@ DI were the greatest los@@ ers on the index , and that with a decline by 4.3 % after which the Sach@@ s had set his estimate for the company rating . &quot;
J@@ D Sports rose by 3,@@ 1 % after the s@@ cap@@ ita company had reported a pre @-@ tax result of 46.@@ 6 million .
the boss of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages are endang@@ ering their expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers &quot; could mean more retail in the bags of the potential customers .
but it is unlikely that this purchase force starts the higher labour costs at his company , he says .
the cost could make an expansion plans by J@@ D Sports , he added , and this could mean that there are less extra jobs .

PE@@ GI@@ DA @-@ poster introduce Leb@@ anese on pot@@ ato
potatoes or don@@ er ?
it goes both - and indeed in the pot@@ ato bad@@ ge , which has developed the Ol@@ den@@ burger Im@@ b@@ iss@@ ary Han@@ i Al@@ h@@ ay .
inspired by the Sp@@ ru@@ ch &quot; pot@@ ato instead of D@@ Ã &quot; on a poster of the PE@@ GI@@ DA movement , Al@@ h@@ ay pot@@ ato and meat put together on a sk@@ ewer .
on the idea , it carried out a poster in a PE@@ GI@@ DA demonstration with the wording of &quot; Pot@@ atoes , &quot; which he had seen by chance on TV .
since then , in his shop he turns into a bar@@ be@@ cu@@ ff , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is a multic@@ ult@@ ural for the stomach , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ h@@ ay &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea has now signed itself at the patent Office at the patent Office in Munich .
there it has been protected by the authority of the authority for recently as Second World War .
how much meat and how much potatoes of the sp@@ line contains , Al@@ h@@ ay does not want to betra@@ y .
only as much : &quot; it tasted even better , &quot; he finds .
even with his customers the culinary international understanding goes well .
met@@ cash starts ground @-@ to @-@ end campaign to combat al@@ di@@ - di@@ arr@@ he@@ a
met@@ cash tries to protect the I@@ ga Fili@@ al in front of a Al@@ di @-@ march in South Australia and Western Australia .
food @-@ wholes@@ alers Met@@ cash has started a ground @-@ link@@ age campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ ga retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance to a 700 million USD Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di launches the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , Met@@ rics and I@@ ga supermarkets are expanding their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ ga through mainstre@@ am marketing and marketing through social media , as well as events like Adel@@ ai@@ de Show .
I@@ ga merch@@ ants and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as Eis@@ manufacturer S@@ immo from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , distributed in I@@ ga @-@ shops , and stores land@@ lords who sell to loyal customers for the South Australian Con@@ clusi@@ on to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash released further details of its defence strategy on September 29 if the wholes@@ alers surplus for food , alcohol and devices to its annual investors strategy .
it stands much at stake , since South Australia and Western Australia almost 30 percent of Met@@ cas@@ hs I@@ ga @-@ Lad@@ en@@ ites make and higher profits as a met@@ es@@ cent I@@ ga network in the Eastern states .
the An@@ ab@@ ap@@ ti@@ sts in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ or@@ ally provincial and I@@ ga retailers come across a much stronger market share , than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to some 14 percent in South Australia .
yet we believe an@@ alysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley that al@@ di twelve months after opening its first markets around five percent of the food market in these two states will take away and all the available players , but mainly independent retailers .
one of the report published this week , analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath from Morgan Stan@@ ley that I@@ ga @-@ Ret@@ ail 360 million turnover per year and Met@@ cash earn 250 million US $ to end of 2016 .
the progn@@ osis is based upon the assumption that Al@@ di in the next year 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA , and generates sales of 500 million $ and 600 million $ in each market .
the loss in food and food business and at the quantities of a high @-@ cent less f@@ using cost @-@ up may cost a cash cash to some 13 million dollars before interest and taxes , said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath .
at the same time , met@@ cash flow market shares in the east states , mainly at Al@@ di and CO@@ LES , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan found that I@@ ga Regi@@ ons are the loyal ones .
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ cas@@ hs Sales at the food and food business by 3.8 percent in 2016 , decreased by 4.2 percent in 2017 and 2.@@ 1 per cent in the year 2018 , and the market share will be reduced from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading Fon@@ ds@@ manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , in doing business in Melbourne that Met@@ als will probably disappear within a decade .
met@@ cash rejected it to respond publicly on the comments from Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash with Mr Dou@@ glass last week has taken contact .
IG@@ A &apos;s market share has declined from 18 percent to 14 percent , and arri@@ vals from Met@@ cas@@ hs dietary and grocery stores , which is approx . 1.@@ 200 I@@ ga retailers , has dropped by 43 percent since 2012 , which reflects the operating income for operating pressure on turnover and mar@@ gins .
the wholes@@ ale dealer te@@ aches itself and inv@@ ests more than 150 million $ to sell the prices of CO@@ LES and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ oth when hundreds of products every week on the same and I@@ ga single retailers in improving their shops through faster growing fresh food and delivering better choice of private @-@ label foods .
Met@@ cas@@ hs main executive director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adap@@ ters and loading programs can be put to vig@@ our and hopes that the wholes@@ alers will return in 2017 for the first time in four years to a lot@@ tery .
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis is supported by President of the Australian tennis courts Steve He@@ aly
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis deserves more praise than criticism for his behaviour .
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis was one of the &quot; coll@@ ater@@ al damage &quot; in the short@@ est storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gi@@ os and deserves to view the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly more praise as criticism for his own behavior .
Kok@@ kin@@ akis , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , which is always called &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; headed by Kyr@@ gi@@ os with St@@ an W@@ aw@@ rin@@ ka on the Montreal Masters into the R@@ amp@@ en@@ licht .
in a fi@@ ery qualification game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati very soon after Kok@@ kin@@ akis und his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison would have to be separated by the arbit@@ rat@@ ors , where Har@@ rison called : &quot; W@@ aw@@ rin@@ ka would have to hit the child . &quot;
while he was recently seen such as he sm@@ ashed a tennis r@@ ack@@ et , after a cr@@ amp@@ f was condem@@ ned a potential US @-@ open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ akis was defended from He@@ aly .
the Teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , in competition with Sam Gr@@ oth around the second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic at the Davis Cup semi @-@ fin@@ als against Great Britain .
&quot; one thing about which I &apos;m quite embarrass@@ ed , is the fact that after my view Than@@ asi was pul@@ led a little into the dispute , &quot; said He@@ aly .
he has broken a bat , when he lost a bat in the US Open , but he is not the first player who broken a bat from Fr@@ ust with himself , and I know Than@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has be@@ aten in the US Open extremely well , even among the fairly pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on and I think he deserve much recognition .
he has a great team around her , he has a great family around her and I think he was treated with a little too high .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he fits into the team and so on he has never worked out a problem with the other players , he is well trained , he is good in form , he is a very stable and well @-@ growing young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged by his own mer@@ it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to be taken into account in the important decision @-@ making decisions that begins on Friday and it describes the &quot; common decision &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the right for everyone , but he protects the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to come back as a long @-@ term integral part of the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , we wish that the team fully focused on the competition and not all the contro@@ vers@@ y around us &#91; Kyr@@ gi@@ os &#93; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I believe that Nick was going swi@@ f@@ tly made to raise wor@@ ms such as Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray . he goes into the eyes of the public , but we try to support him . some time outside of the spot@@ light , in which he can only think of it , I consider appropriate for the team and it is best for the team and it is best for him .
Europe &apos;s refuge@@ e crisis : Hungary declares emergency , closes the border , holding refugees
Hungary explains the emergency , and accompanied the south @-@ border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all the fest which were trying to get illegal into the country . everything with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed at the border , as hundreds of migrants gathered at a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ sland , and Ser@@ bian officials with rebel@@ lion .
the people who fled from violence thre@@ w for a unknown time in a land stri@@ pe on the road between the two check@@ points of the countries fixed and built tents , and left there down .
but fru@@ stration on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a police posts about them , the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open the limit ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and sm@@ ells ins@@ ults against the Hungarian polic@@ eman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some points out of protest food and water .
Ser@@ bian foreign minister declared it &quot; unacceptable , &quot; that migrants would be returned from Hungary , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece will arrive .
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ater@@ al harm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there must be talks in Brussels and other countries in the coming days &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence of the ung@@ ar@@ isch @-@ Ser@@ bian border came a day after the 28 @-@ Nations @-@ blo@@ c with a str@@ ingent meeting in Brussels could not arrange a common immigration policy .
the Ministers agreed , however , share the responsibility for 40,@@ 000 people who would have sought out in over@@ sail@@ ed Italy and Greece . they assumed their hope that finally - next month or until the end of the year - an agreement would be agreed that the EU states other 1@@ 20,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on Tuesday a special summit of the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
Hungary , however , reduced its hopes for an inclusive action between Brussels and its neighbours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday there were further authority in two southern regions with more powers to cope with the crisis , so that they could accelerate streets and accelerate asylum methods . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Hungarian Minister of Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said , whose land was also the building of a thorn dra@@ ined along its border with Romania , in order to stop the influ@@ x of migrants to the country - after it ends a fence at the Ser@@ bian border .
C@@ BS News @-@ correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even imprison@@ ed assen in the race to build the Stach@@ el@@ wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months Hungary has grown for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East as a significant increase in the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban , however , has been insi@@ sted that most of the coming economic migrants are looking for a better life , and not war wings who are entitled to protection - a view which is strong in contradiction to other EU states , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws , which occurred at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border , or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high Za@@ it@@ us to build the government along the southern border to Serbia , for a crime . these laws also put higher adhesi@@ on for condem@@ ned human retailers .
&quot; due to the situation created by the mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the state of state , &quot; said Governance Z@@ OL@@ T@@ AN Kov@@ acs Rep@@ or@@ ter in the southern city of Sz@@ eged .
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament will still have to agree with the use of the military nor the use of the military , which is expected for next week but re@@ por@@ ter of Associ@@ ated Press reported on the border a difficult armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs .
Gy@@ org@@ y Bak@@ on@@ di , country @-@ security consulting for Or@@ ban , said that authorities are 45 people when trying to cross the border , 15 others were already deeper into the country .
they come over by acc@@ ent the fence , they are now in police and are acc@@ used to the preparation of criminal off@@ ences according to the new laws .
authorities are able to fix the fence quickly .

choice @-@ 2016 : Hill@@ ary clin@@ ton advancement before Bern@@ ie S@@ anders in national survey
the former US @-@ State Hill@@ ary Clinton remains a two @-@ digit leader in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level , but Sen@@ ator Bern@@ ie S@@ anders wins her compared to the ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 per cent of democratic elect@@ or@@ ate in the pre @-@ elections ( 58 percent before ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( rise by 17 percent ) .
Joe bi@@ den , who has not yet proclaimed whether he has established for the presidential elections , receives funding from 15 percent of the democratic elect@@ or@@ ate elections .
more than five months before beginning of the pre @-@ elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is defined , what Candi@@ dates they are supporting .
but Clin@@ tons supporters are in their choice more than that of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS @-@ News survey , Clinton has lost a number of demo@@ graphic groups while S@@ anders had achieved some prizes .
Clinton has a great advantage with women and a mixture , but these le@@ aps have reduced .
their support in the men is significantly lower , and S@@ anders is only with 5 points .
both Clin@@ tons benefit in democratic voters under the age of 50 has tri@@ um@@ ed , and they and S@@ anders are now on the same height .
but Clinton still has a big edge for the older voters .
last month Clinton had a two @-@ digit lead in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has now a 5 @-@ point lead in this group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about half of the democratic elect@@ or@@ ate sel@@ ections say that they would strongly support Clinton when they were nominated by the Party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a quarter would assist them with some anticip@@ ation and another 15 percent would only support they because they &apos;re the nom@@ inee .
six percent would not support them .
maybe not surprising that Clin@@ ics are current and most of all you are thrilled .
the views are stronger at those who currently not support Clinton - only about one quarter would be delighted .
while 48 percent of the democratic elect@@ or@@ ant say that they did not support Clinton with enthusiasm , say less re@@ publi@@ can elect@@ or@@ ate over their sp@@ itz@@ enk@@ andi@@ daten Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
when Clin@@ tons can be asked in an open question why they want the nom@@ inee director , is the most common answer that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) followed by the view that it &apos;s time is that a woman is president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
the Clinton &apos;s supporters is also mentioned in its association with Bill Clinton ( 9 per cent ) .
consent to the handling of problems and the voters will also be c@@ ited .
since the Vice @-@ president thro@@ ws up a potential for the presidential race , 57 per cent of democratic voters want to see him in the race - although a third believes it should not do it .
if democratic voters are asked for a presidential election , who for the party would be their second choice is bi@@ den at the top .
of Clin@@ tons trailers more than half that beer would have their second choice far from S@@ anders .
decided bending , not for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , the Hill@@ ary Clinton tons will increase in front of S@@ anders , from 20 points with bi@@ ds in competition on 30 points without him in the race .
five percent of the democratic voters want to see Clinton as a nom@@ inee with the best chances to win the election , however this number is dropped by 78 percent last month .
Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees him as the &quot; sel@@ f@@ ist &quot; has increased .
nevertheless , with the question of what is more important when a Candi@@ date is more important , the democratic voters call on the voters .
similar to last month , no single democratic candidate or potential candidate to be considered unacceptable for these voters .
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates bring good results in some important characteristic for voters of their party elections .
we regard Clinton , S@@ anders and bi@@ den as honest and trusted and equipped with powerful leaders .
beer cuts with the three candidates best from honest@@ y , while such strength is the guide .
thirty per cent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trusted , twice as many people say about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not think of him .
democratic voters of the elections are generally seen Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ ological ide@@ ological in accordance with their views .
with all these measurements , approximately a quarter of democratic elect@@ or@@ ate has no idea of dist@@ anders .
da questions to Hill@@ ary Clin@@ tons continued use of a personal email address and a server during the term of the Presidency are satisfied with their declaration on the matter and say that it does not affect its opinions in total .
but it is another story in the American public .
the half of the Americans now is dis@@ satisfied with their statement , while only one third is satisfied .
the public opinion of this was in March , shortly after the problem of the light was split .
most Americans said that the email contro@@ vers@@ y had no effect on their general opinions of Clinton , although 36 per cent said that their opinion were still worse .
there are mainly Republi@@ cans , more than six of 10 , saying that their views from Clinton have worse .
although Clinton is regarded by the voters of their party as honest and trusted , this is still a problem for them among the voters in total : only 32 per cent see them as honest and trusted , eight percent lower than in the last month and 15 points fewer since May .
62 percent of the elect@@ or@@ ate are not eligible for an honest and trusted person .
at the same time 55 percent of elect@@ oral justified nation@@ ally far also tr@@ ump is not tru@@ thful and not trust@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump will get good grades in leadership .
from the six tried , bi@@ ds , Car@@ son and Bush best at honest@@ y .
a majority sees S@@ anders rather than honest@@ ly , but as at Car@@ son , many do not think of him .
the error rate of the sample of 3@@ 51 German voters with the pre@@ election is six percent@@ ages .
Ben Car@@ son moves at land@@ es@@ further survey about Donald Tr@@ ump
Ben Car@@ son is at the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times closely behind Donald Tr@@ ump
at the two candidates , half of the voters decide in the new pol@@ l , and others lose dramatically .
Republi@@ can voters want far@@ thing in large numbers . the support grows by 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey which was conducted in the Fox News debate last month , by 27 % in the survey on Tuesday .
but Car@@ son flow@@ ed at the same time from 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son meets demo@@ graphic groups well and tr@@ ump among re@@ publi@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Gou@@ ver@@ neur John Ka@@ sich , is be@@ aten with Wis@@ cons@@ in Gover@@ nor Scott Wal@@ ker who died down the bottom , and a 10 % support in the last month to now 2 % .
the former Florida @-@ govern@@ or J@@ eb Bush , the former govern@@ or of Ark@@ ans@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida @-@ Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio are located at 6 % on the third place .
the fault of the sample of the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , which was last week released , shows that Car@@ son rises in the surveys - it lan@@ ded at 19 % support in the re@@ public@@ ans , behind the tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the recent survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed sp@@ ump clearly before Car@@ son .
with a view to one of the last week broken Car@@ son , Tr@@ ump took some side @-@ hi@@ eves for the former neuro@@ ch@@ ir@@ ting , even after Car@@ son would be ap@@ olog@@ ised to question g@@ umps in question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump on last Saturday during a campaigns show in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot;

five members of the Bro@@ therhood charged with the death of a Bar@@ uch College @-@ Ne@@ ul@@ ings
almost two years after a student during a schi@@ en@@ vir@@ al ritu@@ als of a student business in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , murder @-@ wr@@ aps for five people will be submitted .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Bru@@ der@@ schaft attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during a intro@@ duc@@ tory evening ritual in September 2013 and consumed its transport to the hospital , which has contributed to his death , distributed the police .
officials said that he had been loaded with connected eyes with a 30 @-@ pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeated , while he tried to go over a frozen field to a destination .
Mr. Den@@ g finally used over head@@ ache , then he fell un@@ conscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Bro@@ therhood does not suit the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g impot@@ ent was power@@ less and wa@@ ited an hour before they brought him to a hospital so the police .
they had however the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing to contact his symptoms of goo@@ gling and Andy Men@@ g , to contact the national presi@@ dents of the Bro@@ therhood , to obtain Council , said Poli@@ tic@@ ef Chris Wagner on a press conference .
&quot; at this point the members , utensils to hide and put the good of the Bro@@ therhood generally over that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ v@@ reef Wagner .
he could not revi@@ ved , and he died out of his wo@@ unds in the next morning .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy , Den@@ g have been repeated with st@@ um@@ pfer power violations in the head , trunk and th@@ igh@@ s .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the sh@@ ines of the Bro@@ therhood . at least a student dies since 1970 every year on the sky , &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ s Family represents in an explanation .
bro@@ therhood and their members must be held accountable , and this step of public authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Monro@@ e received a indic@@ t@@ ment due to Mor@@ als third Gr@@ ades for the first five members .
twenty @-@ thirty members of the Bro@@ therhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged for schi@@ essen and formation of a criminal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not only want to make the people involved , but if there is an organisation that has been officially or in@@ official - so we will also consider this to account , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner on a press conference held on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;

this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
a p@@ inn@@ acle comes , and the pet shall fall into the sl@@ ender , p@@ endant for bonds , and the economy is gli@@ de into a recession .
we know that .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will take and how long it will stop .
in particular , the history for the economy is only a small step guide to the exp@@ ir@@ ation process .
a recession came within only 11 months after the first level of interest rates and lasted for 86 months .
the Con@@ gressi@@ vity of the Federal Reserve with the raising of interest rates is often , although not always , a factor in how the economy and finance investments are responding .
therefore , representatives of the US Central Bank have so strongly emphas@@ ised that investors should not focus on it when it starts to increase interest rates but rather to the period , which is needed for normal@@ isation .
in fact , several variables play a role .
at the end , market participants could find that the whole excitement because of a zinc @-@ cave could possibly be exagger@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis is in@@ vari@@ ably interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cheap money &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jess@@ , , Ch@@ ef@@ ö@@ kon@@ om bei Capital Economics , in a communication to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast we do not expect the grad@@ ual return of the US interest to normal heights , but still at too low level to commemor@@ ate the se@@ ism@@ ic shock , which seem to be fear@@ ed .
however , this does not mean that there will be no effect .
here is a focus on historical trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
how the market has seen in the last month , the decrease of Zin@@ nia can make things for a while vol@@ ati@@ l .
as soon as the increase arrives , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; there is apparently a tendency that wealth from 12 to 24 months after the first increase will be re@@ ed , which perhaps once again reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said German @-@ Bank an@@ alysts in a newer study of what has happened to Zin@@ ser@@ rul@@ ings of the F@@ ed .
more specifically , the market is usually mentioned in the last 35 years - about 14 per cent - on the way to Zin@@ c ca@@ vities , quite flat in the 250 days after a average return of 14.@@ 4 percent according to its current analysis , the Bob D@@ oll , Chef plant @-@ Strateg@@ e at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s published .
the Deutsche Bank said that the effect on the shares ten@@ ally appear later in the Contin@@ ent cycle and the profits they begin to reduce .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic survival , but Zin@@ ser@@ ca@@ sions encourage them often .
in the current case the F@@ ed is faced with some conditions , which had not existed before and that could accelerate a recession .
very remarkable is that the gross domestic product is kept in the proximity of its lowest score at a rock @-@ cave of the F@@ ed .
according to the Deutsche Bank , the 118 Zin@@ ser@@ ca@@ vities had only twice the nominal GDP in 1950 than 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 rose by 3.6 percent , only few that this will last and expect the third quarter according to the Atlanta F@@ ed , only 1.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Zin@@ ser@@ ca@@ vities in such a frag@@ ile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and throw the question on whether this time is different , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants have made the whole year on a zinc @-@ cave of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed at the session of the Federal Open Market Committee in this week which ends on Thursday .
while there are many Strat@@ os and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC could match an increase in this meeting , the Fut@@ ures @-@ Commerce are only a probability of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study all boo@@ ster cycles have taken place from 1950 to today in a super cycle with increasing s@@ ulation in GDP and placed on @-@ to @-@ date back very quickly after the start of recovery in the shade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what the worst recession in the observed phase was .
the current cycle is by far the longest that the F@@ ed has been wa@@ ited since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and these are so far 74 months .
the firm income was also vol@@ ati@@ l since the market decre@@ ases a zinc @-@ cave , and the pattern is pretty much the same as on the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than with shares if they change their strategic course .
at bonds , the rit@@ es seem to change direction as soon as the first increase / lower@@ ing in the cycle takes place .
at the end of the Incre@@ ase @-@ cycle the bond @-@ cycle drop immediately , the Deutsche Bank said .
the Strat@@ os of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the rise in the interest rates of this will lead to a delay between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a bott@@ ling of the curve .
flood bonds often bring better income in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher income , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come @-@ Analy@@ sti@@ n at Schw@@ ab , in an Analyse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interesting is that markets already adapted to F@@ ed strategy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation forecast , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of severe monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the yield , bor@@ der@@ ings have grown up and the vol@@ ati@@ lity has risen - all the characteristics of the market when the F@@ ed shar@@ p@@ ens its strategy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
within the large and whole year , companies who benefit the bigger part of their business operations in the US , benefit from interest rates and local products are more attractive .
multination@@ als with high debts are worse than an increase of dollars will make their products on the global market more expensive and also financing their debt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares ten@@ ds to react very positive after an initial zinc @-@ cave , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man &apos;s an@@ alysts in a report to the customer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with strong balance sheet , companies have sur@@ passed the balance sheet after each of the Zin@@ ser@@ ca@@ sions 1994 , 1999 and 2004 at the average of 5 percentage points .
companies with high capital pensions and low vol@@ ati@@ lity in their shares also met their counter@@ parts with low quality at the average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt is a big problem .
businesses with a high percentage of flexible interest rates are most losing , gol@@ fers said .
outside of the pure stock @-@ play consumers will also benefit through the rising dollars .
as@@ par@@ agus could see profits through higher income , even if experts are of different opinions , how soon it will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says EP member Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the conserv@@ ative member of the parliament is cri@@ tici@@ zed the sender because of its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conspir@@ acy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is not distinguished from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also quoted on the BBC Music Awards and said that she im@@ it@@ ated only The Br@@ its
Parliament Coll@@ ege Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins attacked the mission The Voice and said that this is not very original .
BBC Radio 3 &quot; conver@@ ts &quot; to Classic FM , maintains a leading European member and increases new pressure on the transmitter , to prove that he does not do something the private transm@@ itters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conserv@@ atives Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC bos@@ ses , that the public @-@ legal radio stations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ver@@ sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer be distinguished from his commercial competi@@ tor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I use the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dum@@ plings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to become Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also quoted at the BBC Music Awards , launched in December 2014 .
the BBC Music Awards , which was launched last year , The Br@@ its seem to be only under a different name .
so , if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneous @-@ mentioned examples where you actually only im@@ itate what already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham .
BBC @-@ Direc@@ tor@@ ate the pro@@ aches back and argu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 is far from his commercial competi@@ tor when it comes to live music and publishing the public .
what I learn from Radio 3 l@@ erne , which I will learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is really un@@ matched .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 , to find new music and to give new works in order , I really consider important for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Dav@@ ey that harder to get involved in getting the audience , when it did in the past , because the British are less informed about classical music .
radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC @-@ production , which during the hearing ai@@ ded in the Committee for the selection of culture , media and sport for it under fire , the commercial ri@@ vals on the feet .
the T@@ ory @-@ MP Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins attacked The Voice - the musical talent Show at the BBC , which was purchased from the Dutch manufacturer Tal@@ pa Media for valued at € 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall was insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 @-@ Show - with Pal@@ oma Fa@@ ith and Boy George as a judge - &quot; produced in a special BBC mode . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added , he wishes that the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hit from our house@@ own barn , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the next time it was a mis@@ erie . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he ref@@ used to exclu@@ de the order of further sections from The Voice in the Future or to give money of the dealer @-@ pay@@ ers for other entertainment formats .
Internet Sur@@ vey in August on the slow@@ est and Black Friday can be responsible for this .
in the first three months of 2015 there were seven percent increase in online selling .
last month , the lowest result existed since the beginning of the records in 2000
online sales increased from three years ago by using mobile phones to shopping
experts believe that Black Friday in November has stopped spending
for over a decade , the virtual purchases has broken , and many of the main shopping streets of Great Britain have turned into gh@@ ost towns .
however , experts say that there are now signs that the online revenue stag@@ nat@@ ing after new numbers only showed seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure on August presents the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say that there are signs that online sales are stag@@ nat@@ ing after new numbers only showed seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you look at the growth rates for the previous years and proceed until 2000 , this has always been developed over time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ RG selling the Guardian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he explained that the online sales grow three years ago , as a buyer set up with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do so in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now , this is par@@ amount , and we might have experience that growth reduces .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon which was imported from the Americas will be considered a reason for re@@ ass@@ uring transform@@ ations .
experts believe that buyer will take their purchases from this event , which will take place on Friday last Friday in November .
last year fifty times the average number of buyers for their computer to make their bar@@ gain , and some tr@@ aders web @-@ sites cr@@ ashed .
experts believe that Black Friday , where the buyer could keep fighting for bar@@ gain , buyers from it , purchases .
a study of the British Ret@@ ail Con@@ sortium found that there was a little bit more than 1 £ !
in some products such as television and washing machines , more than one third of the purchases are now performed via Web @-@ shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of people are buying clothes and shoes online rather than in the field cities .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said it is necessary to face the growing demo@@ graphic trends that have more female single households that make more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our stores .
we need to move this stronger into balance .
as a matter of principle , half of our customers from women are made with 80 percent of the decisions concerning the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the top of a British in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 index listed companies , also has transformed her top team to reflect a equal number of men and women in executive positions .
King@@ f@@ isher is almost the only company that has been occupied with women exactly 50 percent of the team , including its management and financial status .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - variety is a key issue here .
it was not difficult to find good women for the super@@ visory boards .
King@@ f@@ isher announces a decline in the half @-@ year round and attempts after the group ass@@ esses the costs for closing the damage .
due to the trend King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q has opened 200 new stores .
function@@ aries of A@@ I / D@@ ob because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity before the Court
at the Landes@@ Tribunal Kl@@ agen@@ furt must be held on Wednesday two function@@ aries of the Austrian Vol@@ leyball @-@ Vi@@ zem@@ power A@@ ich / D@@ ob because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and play@@ through education .
the def@@ endants were not guilty .
one of them was also charged for am@@ t@@ sm@@ iss@@ emia .
from this acc@@ us@@ ation he was acqu@@ itted in May ( German ) .
the current process was ad@@ jour@@ ned .
according to Ober@@ sta@@ ats@@ an attorney Robert Ri@@ ffel had appeared in the pre @-@ examination , that the def@@ endants in the years 2006 to 2011 receive funds from the accounts , which they used in their functions disponi@@ eren , for private purposes .
the damage is covered with around 400@@ ,000 Euros .
the sports function@@ aries are also charged for financial transactions .
this fact is the chairman of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ch@@ op@@ ener &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Rich@@ ard@@ Micha@@ ela San@@ in , &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it should be negoti@@ ated at a later date .
for the acc@@ us@@ ation of the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defense dar , that the association had no influence on the association at no time .
the sport@@ f@@ ere would have been only administration and compens@@ ated for the sports club , for which it has been active from 1982 to 2011 , and have invested a lot of time and money out of the debt - the li@@ abilities st@@ ru@@ sted in 2001 approximately 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ illing ( approx . 44.@@ 000 Euro ) .
&quot; back then we were standing in front of the situation : leading the club on or block it ? , &quot; told one of the def@@ endants , in the bread@@ board of the financial system .
with his colleagues and co @-@ acc@@ used he decided to undertake this task .
with all the risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have prescribed money , our life insur@@ ances as security in the bank did &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said in the inspection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association has been agreed upon : you can set the money freely , it may only be made public debt .
furthermore , the payment of the administration of administration issued by the administration of administration have been resolved by 1991 .
therefore , one became part of the administration of administration only years later , namely after the year 2003 , as a plus in the account has been paid .
therefore , l@@ ump @-@ form@@ work and not detailed instructions , explain the former Ob@@ mann the processes .
the accounts and austerity are administ@@ ered by the two sub@@ def@@ endants , said the second def@@ endant .
why the withdrawal of the association has not been revealed in detail , the judge asked .
the association has not been interested in detail for the financial behavi@@ ours , important be just the debt of debt , so the answer .
when 2011 started against the one functional investig@@ ators for am@@ t@@ sm@@ iss@@ ties , an amount of 1@@ 20,000 euros was transferred to the account .
the dec@@ ay has been , explained the acc@@ used .
this securities trading ran out on the name of the second acc@@ used and was according to whose statement is not known .
&quot; why ? &quot; did the judge wanted to know .
there@@ for the respon@@ dent did not know no answer .
then he said he finally , he believed that this is the best for the club .
if something happens if nobody had known something of this money , the prosec@@ ut@@ or placed in the room .
the co @-@ acc@@ used had been informed , justified the functional .
this pre @-@ assignment was formulated as &quot; scar@@ c@@ ess &quot;
why lack of in@@ dem@@ nity ? , wanted to know the judge and prosec@@ ut@@ or .
there@@ after the first acc@@ used , he did not agree with this wording as the club has never been a damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do when the attorney says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with whom you are all out of the hook . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , the functional , he never got a cent content , he will only calculate kilometers and di@@ ets .
on di@@ eting , he put the club 1,000 euros per month , however , the actual effort was however much higher , he added .
exact documents for the early years could not be acc@@ used .
these be after an audit in which everything has been assessed as properly , no longer has been preserved , explained them .
od@@ ometer was also related to the second def@@ endant .
to be dispos@@ ed of , in cash , he has to de@@ part from his place of international humanitarian market to bank to B@@ lei@@ burg , he explained in his statement .
the main proceedings will continue on the 23rd of September with the inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation of witnesses .

time of decision on interest rates for the US exp@@ c bank
the world has been observed if the US base bank at two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , comes together to make the important decision whether for the first time nearly a decade the interest rates are up@@ lifted or not .
a survey conducted among 80 econom@@ ists who were asked by Reu@@ ters was that a little more than half , which still last week of view was that the F@@ ed will do this , now that the F@@ ed will keep a little longer and keep interest rates at the current status of 0 - 0.25 per cent .
it is a historical event because it is seven years ago since the F@@ ed interest on N@@ ULL .
&quot; for the first time , we approach the situation where a large central bank may start the zero range and start a process of norm@@ alization of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bian , leading employees at the Peters@@ on Institute for International Economics .
the U.S. economy is on a relatively good performance , Bil@@ li@@ ons dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less corro@@ sive outlook on global circumstances .
she war@@ ns the markets to adapt to an increase but the signs pointed out that the chances against such a step are good .
the decision is to be announced at 20.00 h ME@@ Z on Thursday
deaths on the Delta State University re@@ duc@@ ting education
after the shooting and T@@ utes of his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he later went on his colleagues a note , Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb a note , to say that he was &quot; sorry &apos; during the first murder and wanted , &quot; he could make it un@@ happened , &quot; the authorities announced on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Mississippi , told that he called l@@ ecturer for Ge@@ ography and Social Education at the Delta State University , the emergency number against 10 : 00 on the Monday morning .
and said , he was shot on someone and someone killed .
he told the staff of the most relevant that police polic@@ emen send to his home .
he said , &quot; I took my wife yesterday evening , &quot; and he mentioned also that a &quot; ad@@ ful dog &quot; is in the house , however , &quot; nobody is distur@@ bing , &quot; but probably be excited . &quot;
the police asked the answering of his name , but he did not give him .
he had no explanation for his shots .
as the police referred to the scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ us@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written notice of Lamb , 45 , the said , &quot; I &apos;m so sorry I wanted to make it und@@ one .
I loved Amy and she is the only woman who had ever loved . &quot;
after writing the note , 300 miles to Delta State University , where he took E@@ than Schmidt , a professor for history , killed , before he eventually took his own life on Monday evening , as polic@@ eman it surrounds him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Universal President William LA@@ FOR@@ GE said he did not know anything from a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite reports on Monday , the Lamb really believed that there were also a relationship with Schmidt , said authorities on Tuesday , there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; triangle relationship &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ us@@ ss was described by Sha@@ awn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said that she was about seven years married , as a &quot; good human being . &quot;
the two were shot 15 years ago , but were friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; o &apos; Ste@@ en said , he and Pr@@ us@@ es had a daughter , who is 19 , and it is destroyed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that Pr@@ us@@ her daughter &quot; were absolutely best friends . &quot;
Pr@@ us@@ ss worked online from home , according to statement from Lin@@ s@@ day Know@@ les , who has identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of pre@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ us@@ her , who poss@@ essed a dog named Light@@ ning , who had been with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; said Know@@ les
the police said that I have inv@@ oked to a certain point on Monday to say to them , &quot; he does not go into prison . &quot;
as polic@@ eman it took him on the highway 1 near Green@@ ville later in that night , he drove his car to the side , fle@@ w walking , ran into the woods and sle@@ w yourself with a shot .
in the spring of 2015 , it was awarded a PhD title in spring 2015 , as well as its vi@@ d@@ dy on the website of the university .

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United can not play Monthly Flyer for double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w encounter the champ@@ ions of the Champions League of Manchester at the PS@@ V Eind@@ hoven centers on a double frac@@ ture of his right B@@ one .
while this was the left @-@ hand def@@ enders of the we@@ aker and there will be no hope for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al gives the hope of playing Sha@@ w again in this season .
the injury was caused by a rec@@ kl@@ ess attack by Hé@@ c@@ tor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w broke into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the playing field and needed oxygen before being transferred to hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double framework , and lies in the hospital . &quot;
he will leave tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then performed in Manchester
it is terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it is very difficult and then plays fantastic and then happens .
in the lo@@ cker room he had a oxygen mask .
he we@@ pt .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double Fra@@ ktur , then it takes six months , and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Moreno seemed to be happy , to be a red card and the im@@ eter of a mo@@ ist meters .
Nicola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbit@@ rat@@ ors , has not pun@@ ished the Mexi@@ kanische Gri@@ ds .
van Ga@@ al susp@@ ected that the Italian Ar@@ cher had am@@ bition .
you can judge for yourself if I say that a El@@ f@@ meter and a red card was due .
it was a very worse attack with both legs .
a twe@@ et at Sha@@ h Account said , &quot; thank you all for your messages . words can not describe how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I come more back again . &quot;
in this case , Manchester United suffer the loss of Luke Sha@@ w in the defeat of the PS@@ V
the England &apos;s def@@ ender has an additional incentive with the European Championship in France to un@@ rest until the coming June .
Philli@@ p Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very worst injury . &quot;
if a player leaves the place with this kind of injury the place are all very sad .
it is never the intent of our players to hurt a opponent .
Moreno has been used in a leg @-@ break , as Mexico against Van Ga@@ als Holland @-@ team at the World Cup 2014 .
&quot; he is very difficult , because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent and when you hear that there is a worst injury , this is not good , &quot; said Coc@@ u .
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball , who was in a different direction , so it looked like if he had touched him , but I could not see the attack on Luke .
talking to S@@ B@@ S6 , Moreno : &quot; I know how to feel it , I know how hard to be something .
I feel very badly there . I am sorry !
the PS@@ V @-@ player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to hospital - after a f@@ oul@@ ting of Chris Sm@@ alling .
certainly David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
it &apos;s a thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child likes a book , it will not take long before you get it almost completely .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child care systems , his favorite Kinder@@ buch to name , decided to consult Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , the 1971 sho@@ cks of Dr. Se@@ uss .
it &apos; was a difficult election , writes Cameron in a message on the company of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children , because it seems to always have a picture or a message that we have so far . &quot;
everything nice and well , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron presented the action of the book , instead a constitu@@ ent of the film version of 2012 re@@ produces , the new characters and details added to extend the pretty short original text .
&quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , the heart of Audre@@ y , to win the heart of Audre@@ y , with her desire to see a real tree , his right name was Theod@@ or Se@@ uss ho@@ el , and died in 1991 but completely unknown .
as if this would not be sus@@ pic@@ ious enough : the former presented text reads , sometimes like the summary of the Lor@@ ax Films , which is presented on the website of Internet Movie database , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , hopes a boy named T@@ ed , the heart of Audre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he is there to be a prag@@ matic Father , it seems unlikely that Cameron comes the action of the book so little familiar . here , an un@@ named boy , like the local environment through the cas@@ u@@ ende Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ver , sno@@ ok@@ ing being , &quot; which speaks in the name of the trees , &quot; understood .
most likely such a relatively low PR job was deleg@@ ated to a volunteer , who did not read The Lor@@ ax not 20 times behind each other .
a Dow@@ ning Street @-@ Spre@@ cher@@ in said that the text was probably entered by Camer@@ ons Options .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text of Camer@@ ons has been delivered , but there was no further immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened from the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult
in Pakistan deposits in the United Arab Emir@@ ates , is a difficult task , but if you chose the Ka@@ der , the England for the tour , is a re@@ petition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my card .
I would not have a compensation plate .
Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ ooks site is perhaps less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in the batt@@ ing list , and the collective body is strong ; they will not carry s@@ cars from 2012 , only a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude .
with the ball rolling Mo@@ ck Ali as Spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he is a Un@@ known size on the test level , is an option for the attack .
in @-@ related message : Adam Ly@@ th took out of the UK @-@ Test @-@ Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex Hal@@ es .
the decision , Adam Ly@@ th release , is of course for me as its chief coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire it is hard to analyze .
with his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that Cri@@ ckets have been align@@ ed with results .
there was no question mark on Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to nom@@ ination nom@@ inations , as - and I have told this - players &apos; their own best choice .
a long time ago , it would have been extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own destiny .
if he hopefully strikes further work@@ flows for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss pra@@ ised his attitude , even if he did not perform as good performances , and this surprised me not ; he is especially a team @-@ man .
the question how much time a test stroke will get to put his character is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton was nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance of home and down@@ wards .
the only acc@@ us@@ ation you can rise was that England first put Jonathan Tr@@ ott in the Caribbean - as the Ly@@ th was in peak - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex Hal@@ es comes in , and he is a stroke that I highly regard highly .
he is a X @-@ factor Cri@@ cket players , which we looked at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season , when he sco@@ red us against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge Square , which hit us very strongly .
he must receive at least the same chances as the before him , but of course , depends on the teams in the United Arab Emir@@ ates .
the idea , Mo@@ een to suggest in addition to C@@ ook , which bring an extra @-@ spin @-@ Bow@@ ters and receive four qu@@ ests would have emerged , and I have nothing about it .
I don &apos;t see why a stroke will not strike there , and this link @-@ handed has already shown that he is a devil @-@ shot of cri@@ cket players .
Mo@@ een may not have done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ est@@ ers@@ hire , but he is number 3 for them , and there is no big difference .
my former team @-@ mate J@@ ustin Lang@@ er played his first 38 tests on the first drop before he joined in 2001 as an op@@ ener .
he made three hundred R@@ uns immediately and looked not back .
Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes to the Ka@@ der as a Back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited dealing with him he was very impressed as a young man .
people may possibly see his statistics - on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a p@@ unt , but there is no large numbers of backup sp@@ inning who raise their hands and the trainers have decided for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
aside from the team England has made a few smart additions to the Train@@ ees .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ a , the Bat@@ sman in Sri Lanka , as advis@@ er for the test games could be a master@@ cou@@ p .
he is one of the nicest cand@@ le of the game which will bring a wealth of experience since he played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood is the white ball stage for the tour and brings energy and a powerful application into the setup .
I always felt that he is created for the international cri@@ cket competition as player or as Coach , and like Mah@@ ela , he views insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh air in the lo@@ cker of fresh air , even if the messages are in line with the previously mess@@ engers .
coll@@ ages Team@@ work with Dur@@ ham , Ben Stok@@ es , will not be employed at the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot received a similar break up against Australia and I have no problem with it .
some will not agree , but co@@ aches and team manufacturers will not determine the schedule .
and you must remember that as with players depend on their jobs .
such decisions are not made easy @-@ heart .

French François Hollande can look forward to his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
it is also a bl@@ ass@@ ent force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist government , Spain a left .
it is difficult to imagine making it a leg to help the self @-@ British to help the self @-@ British , whose energy should be used better to prevent Scotland &apos;s from the UK - something that they do not want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st ten@@ dencies have .
therefore , some such ministers may even be un@@ even more helpful notes , quite in SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum @-@ dum@@ pling 2017 to accelerate the Bre@@ x@@ it process , susp@@ ected my boyfriend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a pl@@ ast@@ ness &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great Britain has won nothing of value from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how r@@ ushes the Fle@@ et Street at its cost and which the EU Sk@@ ep@@ tic is the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press spok@@ es@@ man , but did not exist during that of Tony Ben@@ n inspired referendum , in 1975 , but did not support our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you can remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euros @-@ Opport@@ uni@@ sts who has made a name as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ lingen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 @-@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot;

to this end , the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ für@@ sten @-@ Sch@@ ur@@ ken , Phone @-@ h@@ ack@@ able Aus@@ mer and the Pseu@@ do non @-@ In@@ ner , who own most of our big newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir believed similar about her , but set that when you &apos;re in a c@@ age with a hot Gor@@ illa in a c@@ age , one gets better ban@@ anas to distr@@ act it instead of getting to his lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ i@@ ri@@ ans as Bla@@ ir itself , when it was founded in Camer@@ en@@ du@@ ms@@ br@@ am , as Bla@@ ir had rejected the principle about the constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 that opened to it a door door .
the press never has it to him .
but the nice Jer@@ emy Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me on the back on Monday at Westminster , a friendly l@@ aps on the back - I said to him that he no longer time for me to re@@ w a boy@@ cot@@ t Bo@@ y@@ ott Mur@@ t Strategy of the 80 @-@ s , an error then and today .
it may take , but he must develop a coh@@ er@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but surely with Andrew Mar@@ r whose BBC @-@ sofa he has left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ n official position on Europe is - I make it a friendly reason - in development .
he says that we should remain in a reform@@ ist EU .
well , most people outside of U@@ ti@@ ps traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ ass@@ ent tendency and the wild sk@@ il@@ ds of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can probably everyone say yes .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but not a b@@ enn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and television this week said , when the sc@@ ant sc@@ outs in it did not ad@@ mit that Cor@@ by@@ n appointment of the pro@@ voc@@ alist John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell was a bad idea .
it remin@@ ded me of the 70 @-@ er years , when his old father must lay down on television for his efforts , il@@ loyal to his Labour Party cabinet , without going too far and to lose his cabinet .
Hil@@ ary &apos;s battle was still more attractive .
but to fight in order to remain &quot; under all circumstances - B@@ enn@@ an expression - was not what is said Mc@@ Donn@@ ell , yet what J@@ C said to his fellow occup@@ ants and members according to all reports on her clause on the end of the evening .
what ever wants to impress the tou@@ ching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n - News @-@ discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the structure of the social media , a bro@@ od @-@ care of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ y@@ al .
it is correct to give Cameron no exemp@@ li@@ fication for Europe that allows him to hold Lab@@ our@@ y support in the fo@@ ol@@ ish campaign for a matter of course like Mc@@ Donn@@ ell .
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins will certainly think so .
but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ ui@@ ties for EU membership - in line with their B@@ enn@@ ite Chess Federation , its anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left @-@ presi@@ dents that is a central principle of dog@@ matic dispute .
as with its ambig@@ ui@@ ties to N@@ ato - Tom Wat@@ son is convinced that J@@ C will not start a campaign for discharge - foreign diplom@@ ats will be oblig@@ ated to try to find a sense of their sup@@ eri@@ ors .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have sus@@ pic@@ ious voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British if this can be all point@@ less ?
the United States are already quite disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was remin@@ ded at the start on Monday of something which was called British Inf@@ lu@@ ence Security Forum .
experts cri@@ tici@@ ze reports by Public Health England via e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
statements of a state @-@ financed agency that E @-@ cigar@@ ettes was less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people , partially with connections to tobacco , said researchers .
experts , who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , Lanc@@ et lan@@ ded by taking the question of Public Health England ( p@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
he published the &quot; key@@ note &quot; in the past month and describes him as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot;
but some researchers have put the resi@@ li@@ ence of the data and transferred to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
an editorial article in the medical journals Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; exceptionally win@@ dy foundation , &quot; on the p@@ he substanti@@ ated his most important conclusion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; two more researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refer to stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ ewell , Professor of Clinical epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said that the public expects that the present measure is that E @-@ cigar@@ ettes is about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on a detailed review of sequ@@ ences and mod@@ elling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , this statement is from a single session of 12 persons who were con@@ ven@@ ed to develop a model for a multi@@ functional decision @-@ making analysis ( multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria Decision - MC@@ DA ) to guide its opinions about the damage caused by different ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ hal@@ ign products ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ised in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ ewell said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose executive director received previously from British American Tob@@ acco resources ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also under@@ write the testi@@ monials of BA@@ T to public health in a sustainability statement , told them .
one of the 12 participants in the meeting agreed to receive funds from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes producer , but not the financing , which he shall have received after reports previously received from the Tab@@ acon companies Philip Morris International .
the reasons for selecting the members of the Gre@@ mi@@ ums are not supplied , but these include multiple @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes , some of which also specify a branch financing in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco .
at the meeting , the tobacco will also take part .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indic@@ atively &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products with most criteria &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ ewell . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these links or limitations is discussed in the writing report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ ewell said that the claims of p@@ he that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are no evidence to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E @-@ cigar@@ ettes than a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
prof Kevin F@@ enton , Director for Health and Well B@@ eing at P@@ he said that on the claims of BM@@ J already responded previously .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E @-@ cigar@@ ettes are considerably less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second li@@ fel@@ ong pre@@ di@@ ver dies in his ad@@ diction .
all evidence will specify that health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes compared to the fact that we continue to study the long term effects .
he has the unique obligation to inform the public about what is evidence of evidence and not , especially when there are so much public confusion about relative haz@@ ards compared to tobacco .
nearly 8@@ 0,000 people are dying annually in a disease with reference to smoking , and smoking is the National Health system two billion £ a year .
due to the clear prec@@ urs@@ or of current evidence , E @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of damage caused by smoking , we fulfill our national jurisdiction .
BBC should re@@ place East@@ En@@ ders , says former chief of Channel 4
the former Chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said the BBC should cease to send programs such as East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give her right arm , &quot; for hit shows such as Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broad@@ cast@@ es should only be used to make the type of programs which is not sent by other UK channels .
he cri@@ tici@@ zed the BBC so that they are publicly available publicly @-@ related programs , which are probably seen by a smaller audience , in harsh re@@ str@@ ate time window against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and transm@@ itters such as BB@@ C4 .
once the BBC @-@ Direc@@ tor@@ ate , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried for six years in his time at Channel 4 without success to get in touch with the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs would like in order or sends that clearly by not sub@@ ven@@ tion@@ ally ri@@ vals &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Johnson said the Ober@@ haus @-@ Communic@@ ator Committee as part of his investigation into the future of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep broad@@ casting fees , what I have in Central or long term not for a good idea , you should not make their production at least on programs , others do not have or put in order .
you send The Voice in a prime time window because they want to achieve the best possible support for their future .
the idea that otherwise nobody would show this is a joke , it is ri@@ dic@@ ulous , it is of course non@@ sense .
Johnson said , &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax would be financed without subsi@@ dies .
the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both original productions .
honest@@ ly , other channels would give its right arm to it .
I would like to see me how this should be publicly available television .
I don &apos;t believe that this would decrease the BBC ever .
Johnson , a business@@ man for series , the Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 said , said the BBC to blame for reviews is &quot; due to the ambi@@ tions of the people who work there and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the most popular broad@@ casts of the BBC once again announce what the former manager of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ om@@ gart speech in Edinburgh in 2003 , proposed that the BBC shows such as East@@ En@@ ders should sell .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal niche programs can go to BB@@ C4 , but they fulfill their tasks , and they can ar@@ gue when they have created on their seem@@ ingly sacred missions to justi@@ fy 4 billion £ Rund@@ funk@@ tions , &quot; Well , we have seen all those ob@@ sc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window where no one wanted to see them ever .
for broad@@ casting , Johnson said the Committee , &quot; I urge you to find a rather rainy day in terms of conditions , who can get the best value here .
of course you think of all , we think that you get a great value for 150 £ a year but for people who &apos;s right for the 150 £ a lot of money , ask me whether this is right , because they consume not much from the BBC .
the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 @-@ chef David El@@ stein , who also said before the Committee on Tuesday , ur@@ ged that the BBC Review their char@@ th@@ ian mission to provide and enter@@ tain . &quot;
he said , only little of the BBC @-@ production would now be officially classified as education - he said that there is 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should change to the public @-@ legal television channels in Australia and Canada .
to the question of partnerships did El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like that of the Pro@@ ms , from which he said that only a hand@@ ful of television will be shown to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ at@@ e@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells through sound @-@ noise
the video shows how the n@@ emat@@ o@@ des will change in the moment in which they are radi@@ ated with sound@@ ing .
scientists have bre@@ d wor@@ ms with gene@@ tically modified nerv@@ ens@@ or , which can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound @-@ waves .
the tiny n@@ emat@@ o@@ des change the direction in the moment when they have with thr@@ ush , which have for the human hearing to high frequencies to be heard .
the stim@@ uli work through the switch @-@ on of mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells , which gene@@ tically modified to wear the membrane channels that respond to ul@@ tras@@ ound surfaces .
see more on this topic : resear@@ cher and write brain activity with light
the researchers said , the wor@@ ms showed the power of a new process , called Son@@ ogen@@ e@@ tics , in which ul@@ tras@@ ound can be used to activate a number of brain , cardi@@ ac and muscle cells outside the body .
S@@ re@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researchers at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , told the Guardian , that the procedure of one day could replace the depths of the brain , an invasive procedure , the electrical stim@@ uli in the brain of humans to treat the symptoms of Park@@ inson &apos;s disease .
F@@ aden@@ wor@@ ms usually react not ul@@ tras@@ ound but Chal@@ as@@ ani placed that they did it when they were surrounded by an liquid with micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic bu@@ b@@ bles .
the bli@@ sters , he found out , reinforce the ul@@ tras@@ ound waves , which then penet@@ rate into the wor@@ ms .
the intensi@@ fied ult@@ ran@@ oise @-@ waves work on structures that are known TR@@ P @-@ 4 channels and be found in the membran@@ es of some of the stran@@ ds .
the sound @-@ waves effect the opening of these I@@ on@@ enk@@ channels and enable the cells that they are assigned to , such a report Nature Communications .
to create ul@@ tras@@ ound n@@ emat@@ o@@ des , changed Chal@@ as@@ ani gene@@ tically the wor@@ ms so that some of their Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on@@ ers TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels wear .
when he turns ul@@ tr@@ asonic to the changed creatures , the sound waves are reinforced by the micro@@ bes and transferred into the wor@@ ms where they have changed the modified mot@@ on@@ ons .
the procedure has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground@@ breaking tool , which enables scientists to in@@ struct ne@@ on@@ ons with stim@@ uli of light and to turn off .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ ogen@@ e@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique might have .
in contrast to light , which must be shipped in an optical fiber to the desired place in the brain , low frequency ul@@ tras@@ ound tissue can happen enorm@@ ously and can therefore be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the loc@@ alized human neur@@ ons temporarily sus@@ cep@@ tible to the ul@@ tras@@ ound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Hal@@ as@@ ani .
other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and ins@@ ulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

the eight golden rules for life in student dormitory
eleven years ago I moved as a self @-@ forget@@ fulness 19 @-@ year @-@ old in a student residence , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those who I have up@@ set - and on the numerous , long @-@ part complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be distill@@ ed in eight simple rules .
the de@@ priv@@ ation of student resi@@ dences ranges from slightly ner@@ ven@@ ous up to absolutely fri@@ gh@@ tening .
it is temp@@ ting to say : people tell , where you come with regards to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &apos;re talking to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &apos;re &quot; honest Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate because in the Ernst , guys , it is just a past@@ ure extract h@@ ah@@ aha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it addresses the interview and helps you figure out people who like in contrast to those you would not speak , even if your lashes were gr@@ ated in fire and these ext@@ ingu@@ ishers would be .
let people .
people often transform themselves into drinks and municipal tions , film @-@ night venues and municipal areas , but they are also the places where people are moving and under@@ wear their gar@@ ments .
react in this : do not think about the university with a relationship
s@@ lic@@ ted ex@@ ited a cru@@ de treatment at the university .
their room should be a refu@@ ge , but many student resi@@ dences form a space @-@ to @-@ room B@@ um@@ mel @-@ Culture , which can be friendly and socially and to life @-@ long friendship .
this may be hell for someone who tries to recover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship continues , but you need to go away , so that I have to preserve the energy I have used for interaction with you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
try to feel when a comm@@ une is exhausted from convi@@ vi@@ ality , and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ ck .
speaking of anch@@ or@@ ice : do it .
a guy in my student dormitory had the idea that a non @-@ lasting door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship connect through b@@ aking .
since you start the university at the height of the Back Man@@ ie , the clo@@ cking at the doors of people to imagine with a plate full of Brow@@ nies , less strange than the welcome of 1950 @-@ he years &apos; welcome in the neighborhood , I give you some smile , so , and now please smile , if I ask you some personal questions .
home @-@ made delicacies to offer is a good way to make friend@@ ships .
your ro@@ omm@@ ate feel oblig@@ ated to enter@@ tain yourself and will join the end perhaps your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends if you are a decent b@@ aker .
badly mixed cl@@ umps of flour , sugar and fat lead to as@@ le@@ ep people if you ank@@ ings .
food to ste@@ al is a course of a student dormitory .
of course , the cl@@ ut@@ ches of chicken is a theft , but is it the result of a drop of Mil@@ k for your tea too ?
check this with the owner .
the chances are good that they say to serve yourself , even if they cook in the interior .
if anyone know your things , the anno@@ ying , and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it balanced as my ro@@ omm@@ ate that added their milk a sink to pun@@ ish .
it is now in prison .
they should not make noise , the people take from sleep or from work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not just about being a constant man , but that you are in the tru@@ est sense of the visitor to the people who are sitting in the gl@@ ash@@ down . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a girl in my cor@@ ridor asked her neighb@@ ors if they make them something , Drum &amp; Bass is le@@ qui@@ eter , for it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning .
it re@@ places with even more loud music .
when they finally heard about 5 pm , they allowed her neighb@@ ors still two hours before they broke their own music , leaving her door and commit themselves to her three @-@ hour examination .
would it not be roman@@ tically if your future spouse would happen by chance to enter the same student dormitory ?
and vice versa , it would not be down@@ side deep embarrass@@ ing if you wish to make a ro@@ omm@@ ate for your future married couple , turn to them again and then see them every day and maybe experience how they bring all common friends to yourself ?
of course , the heart goes its own ways - but if a hot ro@@ omm@@ ate is definitely not your future couple , try at least to talk to your unter@@ bow a little reason .
in the exciting moment you notice that somebody has left its keys in his not closed room is the border between a Ul@@ k and bullying , as it seems .
a good stretch is funny , but it only takes moments , till it becomes the bo@@ omer@@ ang .
grant through di@@ aling a valuable and am@@ using lesson on safety - but you never distr@@ ust your room using t@@ ooth@@ paste and sh@@ ampoo .
shut your door , and place their key in a glass of water , which you will then place in the free@@ zer - but t@@ ack@@ down your poss@@ essions on the ceiling is no longer than twice .
Sem@@ i @-@ Com@@ enh@@ ouses for refugees , all @-@ deser@@ ved
the real estate contrac@@ tor Markus G@@ ild@@ ner builds in the mid@@ section Eck@@ ental Sem@@ i @-@ houses for people who did not have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , about refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need housing , but also the attrac@@ ting mother and the righteous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am showing how one can still find good and good today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interview &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees are pushing back onto the Resi@@ stance .
the entrepren@@ eur Markus G@@ ild@@ ner believes to know how fast cheaper living room can be created : he builds in a project Sem@@ i @-@ houses for refugees .
Mr. G@@ ild@@ ner , a lot of refugees will push onto the Resi@@ stance .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : the mass accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
because the people remain a great part here .
in the light of the refuge@@ e est@@ ro@@ ms , we also need sufficient living space in the next decades .
a whole ban@@ quet , three @-@ sto@@ rey @-@ detached house is the solution .
G@@ ild@@ ner : a Sem@@ i @-@ house needs the least place .
it makes integration .
it is different if people under@@ ne@@ ath the people in residential blocks .
each of the six houses , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consisting of three housing units for each four asylum seek@@ ers .
each apartment has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it may be that many refugees will say , it is again peace , I go back .
then the houses can easily be re@@ constructed according to their needs .
how high are the costs ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house ventil@@ ated on 184 000 Euro , without grounds .
this is man@@ age@@ able .
six months the construction took place .
this is reasonable .
have the construction requirements require their plans to be complicated ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : civil law I have removed my project correctly .
particularly complicated , it always makes the dro@@ pping D@@ amo@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ worth special structure and the actu@@ ation procedure .
ig .
it is still supp@@ ressed , who creates in a detached house three apartments , needs at least three pitches .
only in cities is missing the space .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the inhabitants react to their char@@ itable project ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : there were those who have thrown forward to creating luxury for asylum seek@@ ers .
what definitely is not true .
but tigh@@ ten you not the ri@@ val @-@ battle for paid apartments ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : true that is true : we had a construction boom in Germany over the last five years , but newly built luxury apartments , which can hardly afford more .
my project has the message , even the normal people need living space .
not only refugees but also the mother @-@ deser@@ ved mother or the righteous .
I show you how to work comfortably and well today at the same time .
therefore it goes .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone OS , if Apple update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by entering the Options app , to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Software Update . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then to install .
some are pushed after the installation of problems as they get an error message telling that the &quot; software update fails . &quot;
to deal with the problem is users advised to either wait , until the rush is back or trying to update via iTunes .
the phone itself leads you through the rest of the process .
this may mean the del@@ e@@ tion of apps to create space - but Apple has made it easier to do so when you use a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install them as soon as the process is complete .

Dr. Frank Müller assumes practice Fel@@ ol@@ ausen and inv@@ ests 310@@ 000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ ausen .
moreover , Sam@@ am@@ communities were also pleased Bernd Bor@@ mann , econom@@ ists in Uta Sei@@ m @-@ Sch@@ wart@@ z and As@@ endor@@ fs Mayor Hein@@ fried Cab@@ bert .
in many places in the countryside - As@@ endorf that is lucky : there , Dr. Frank Müller on the 1st of October took the practice of his field .
during the Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ ausen , her husband said Karl @-@ Heinrich his successor into the next few months still with half a place to go .
after a uph@@ e@@ av@@ al phase , Müller opened its practice on October 12th , until then he is investing 310@@ 000 Euro in the premises at the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ straße 6 .
it was sympathy to the first glance , when the Fel@@ ste@@ els met for years Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , who currently gradu@@ ated their professional estim@@ ation in the occupational hospital and who wants to join them in practice .
&quot; we always had the mind that the gar@@ bage would fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ low ausen and laugh@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I was come , I have simply called it to ph@@ oned them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple Müller liked the idea to operate its own practice in future in the future .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact to the patients are very attractive for us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year Müller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get to know the families about the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage he will soon see his own boss .
and so one was in touch , the gar@@ bage sold the house with practice .
living they will continue in Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
there , the two @-@ fold family father Frank Müller also grew up , his media studies in Hannover following stations in several medical practice and in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently acting as a mat@@ atri@@ cian in Sul@@ ingen , in 2009 he was appointed to the executive ambul@@ ance in the district Di@@ ep@@ holz and is engaged in hon@@ orary staff in the DR@@ C @-@ willingness Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
as of 19 September , the practice for the new boss will be prepared .
during the sur@@ geon Dr Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ ste@@ ausen served as a household sur@@ geon , he speci@@ alizes his spouse Ur@@ sel ( intern@@ ist ) on the gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology .
the gar@@ bage dump , both Inter@@ ni@@ sten , want to settle as pets .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the end@@ os@@ copy does not come from , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 38 @-@ year Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the conversion , the rooms will be modern .
we will offer more ul@@ tras@@ ound exam@@ inations as well as long @-@ term and loading of the EK@@ GS and need an inter@@ acting @-@ room more .
the ED@@ V is also completely renewed .
a grant from a total of 500@@ 00 euros will get the gar@@ bage dump as part of a funding tool from the county circuit ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; this shows how pro@@ ud@@ ly and happy we are , that the practice is continued , &quot; empha@@ sizes Sam@@ t@@ Commun@@ it@@ ger@@ meister Bernd Bor@@ mann .
about 2000 patients come according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll each quarter into practice Fel@@ low , in the northern German average practice it is about 500 .
in As@@ endorf there is another general practitioner .
a positive effect of the practice due to Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains the loud Ur@@ sel Fel@@ g@@ ausen in As@@ endorf .
if no successor was found , it would have gone .
those who visited the gar@@ bage @-@ hour is still looking ahead of all in familiar faces : assumes the seven medical professional recru@@ ited and the puri@@ fication of the field @-@ ste@@ al .
with their part@@ ing ends in As@@ endorf an era , after all the medic@@ s have practic@@ ed for 30 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rec@@ alls Ur@@ sel Fel@@ lows . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a little melan@@ chol@@ y they hunt after the long time .
&quot; but we &apos;re still living in Hohen@@ mo@@ or , and many patients will surely see yet , &quot; says the dormitory .
your man is compl@@ emented : &quot; we have a 6000 square meter @-@ plot . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I always pressed before garden work , now it could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the couple has two grand@@ son and he is travelling .
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees by &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the border controls also passed on to our south @-@ border &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the minist@@ erial Minister for Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls at the Hungarian border remain in parallel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; still , it is clear that everyone who wants to make an asylum application this can also be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; natural &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the supply and safety of the people is in the fore@@ ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also clear that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the people need to know that we do not accept the lim@@ it@@ less migration flows , also not on the Austr@@ o @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia awak@@ ens &quot; cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia refuse
the Croatian Government has previously announced that Slovenia wants to travel further refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany and in circum@@ cor@@ rid@@ ors can also establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
quite so the interior of the Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach was not .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely inad@@ missible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Slovenia is the monitoring of the border - especially in Hungary - intensi@@ fy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the border with Croatia is as an external border of the scheme , however , is already very controlled .
as the Minister stressed , he wants to sell his borders to refugees but not abri@@ ye .
&quot; every EU member has to fill its obligations , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar .
as the Croatian Government , the first refugees had already tried in the evening hours to Tuesday , in the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d , to depart@@ ing to the registration .
the Croatian police could interv@@ ene in the nearby fields of interest .
according to local media since then , in Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik ever meet police vehicles with new refugees .
it is mainly concerned about Sy@@ rer and Afgh@@ ans , including a number of women and children .
also , ambul@@ ance services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days there shall be a country with around 4000 refugees , said Interior Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
moreover , buses made from Pres@@ evo at the Maced@@ onian @-@ Ser@@ b border , which so far migrants had brought to the Hungarian border , in the direction of Croatia , reported Croatian and Ser@@ bian media on Wednesday agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the government in Belgrade organised , however , that it is whether people adh@@ ere to adh@@ ere to certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither can we do it , nor do we want it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the media report , at least in the morning a first bus arrived with around 50 refugees in the Ser@@ b border town of Si@@ d , during the day a further buses were expecting .
on Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the in@@ rush were the whole night away from the approximately 500 kilometres distant ma@@ z@@ ed@@ onian border with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that Hungary has made , so we said the police that we should drive here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany by Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it could actually actually be used for monitoring observer already previous shift from the previous Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Macedonia to a somewhat further located distance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive possibilities to limit control &quot;
the Interior of Croatia &apos;s Interior O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously empha@@ sized that his country has prepared for the event of a strong refu@@ ge of refugees and prepare appropriate plans for possible read@@ ings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; details N@@ amed it did not say he pointed out that Croatia as the non @-@ Schengen member &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have extensive possibilities to limit control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can qualify strict controls in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partner places a good record since then , with respect to the standard of border controls .
after the Hungarian border fence we continue to invest around 300 refugees in the Hungarian border fence .
according to Bel@@ gra@@ f media reports they had spent the past night at the border crossing H@@ org@@ os , who runs to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cros@@ ses H@@ org@@ os and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely locked .
whether the remaining refugees then want to travel to Croatian border is still un@@ clear .
the Ser@@ bian interior ministers N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic tried to put the mit@@ ry in H@@ org@@ os nor to calm : he kept the debates about alternative routes for refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed , for breakfast .
it would not be a great deal of refuge@@ e pay at the moment .
one could not say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country .
Sup@@ ported migrants to - dangerous - alternati@@ v@@ rou@@ ten
however , private Hungarian refuge@@ e shel@@ ters have already begun to distribute the refugees away on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia .
however , the border agreement between Serbia and Croatia is not harm@@ less : in parts of the border area , there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatian war .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine sp@@ atial was sent in the border region .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue of death and dying may be afflic@@ ted with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , especially the hos@@ pice movement in recent years have contributed significantly to the human being . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the map is remin@@ isc@@ ated that the F@@ ed @-@ chairman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and their colleagues put the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a second order from Congress : maxim@@ izing the US employment and prices here stable .
but since the big recession the F@@ ed leaders have recognised that there is an un@@ written third @-@ such mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X @-@ factor in a decision that is too close to predic@@ ted them . it is announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to become acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed from the un@@ preced@@ ented interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most data of the economy show that it is solid grows , the recent turbul@@ ences in the global financial markets make the already pre @-@ sigh@@ ted F@@ ed Repres@@ ent@@ atives , these vol@@ ati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for Federal bonds - and be it just around a quarter percentage point .
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation primarily be the most important thing to observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , Ch@@ ef@@ economical at the Mak@@ ler@@ company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; but I think that if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase interest rate , the increased uncertainty around the global marketplace is enough justi@@ fication , continuing to wait , &quot; she said .
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which sec@@ ures on itself the financial market .
about half of the economies , which were recently asked by Bloom@@ berg , have predic@@ ted a zinc @-@ cave this week .
but the financial markets await a waiting for the F@@ ed , with a key indi@@ k@@ ator , which shows only a 30 % chance of increasing .
this indicates a drop of the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the sentence , unless that the Strat@@ os re@@ lie@@ ve the strike by offering that another increase is far away .
on Tuesday the D@@ ow Jones Industrial average value at 22@@ 8.@@ 89 points or around 1,4 % on 16.@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that F@@ ed politics maintained the sentence during this week said John Lon@@ ski , Ch@@ ef@@ ö@@ kon@@ om at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would lift the propositions at that time , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if it does , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she needs to go very far in their declaration to calm the financial markets , so that they do not get panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts ar@@ gue that a Zin@@ ser@@ ca@@ sion would calm the financial markets , because they are uncertainty about when the F@@ ed will act , be eliminated .
still a month ago the F@@ ed seemed to increase by 0,25 percentage points in this month , the first small step in a slow shar@@ pen@@ ing of the mon@@ ary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the United States .
Y@@ ellen had said in Spring and in the early summer they expect this year despite the complaints of liber@@ als that would expect more economic progress , an increase in the proposition .
although the creation of jobs in August slow@@ ed down , the improvement of the labour market in this year was solid .
the unemployment rate rose to 5.@@ 1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and close to the level that sees the F@@ ed as full employment .
you have shown an indication of an recovery .
and although the inflation was constantly under the yearly @-@ purpose of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed Repres@@ ent@@ atives told that the main reason the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices may be .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can cope more interest rates and need it because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , Ch@@ ef@@ ö@@ kon@@ om bei Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets all over the world had coinci@@ ded together after China had been upgraded its currency .
the D@@ ow Jones Industrial average was worth more than 16 % among its peak , when investors fear@@ ed that a slow@@ down of Chinese economies would be the global growth thr@@ ott@@ les .
the market is a bit recovered in this month , whereby the D@@ ow is now around 10 % below the Ho@@ ch of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , the market turbul@@ ences influence the complex calculation when you can increase interest rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the events on the financial markets and news on the weakness of the Chinese economies in recent weeks did not occurred , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US monetary bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now he pre@@ di@@ ct that she will be waiting for at least one month to get the effect better on the grip .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be and there is almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner .
the health of the world economy is none of the major companies of the F@@ ed , therefore it should not be involved in its decision making .
but in the end , the F@@ ed Monetary Auth@@ orities has become the World .
the influence of the Central Bank has been huge in recent years .
the mere indication of the then leadership of the then leadership Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 that the F@@ ed their mon@@ et@@ arian expansion &quot; could be nar@@ row@@ ly , able conf@@ usions around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly popular with each other , they can not only monitor the developments at another place , but also to consult with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their decision @-@ making is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more Art as science &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of the global strategy for the asset management of the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeff@@ rey l@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that the F@@ ed has a history of transi@@ tions in financial market movements that seem to be linked with the economic fundament@@ als .
l@@ acker , un@@ authorised member of the Federal Open Market Committee , is committed to a zinc @-@ cave , c@@ ited decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce its leadership to 0,75 percent@@ ages in three meetings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite multiple recogni@@ z@@ able impact on the growth in the US &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one year later the F@@ ed Repres@@ ent@@ atives made these cuts .
the F@@ ed should focus aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis like the market encounters , in 2008 , Adam S. Poznań , former member of the Committee on the interest rate of the Bank of England .
the recent turbul@@ ences are not coming near the level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it certainly does not want to get into the situation where they are afraid of a zinc @-@ cave because the markets became more exciting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Poznań , President of the Peters@@ on Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed , I don &apos;t think that it should require time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Leben@@ sh@@ ilfe for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany in these days .
a warm welcome to prepare , does not go without engagement of inn@@ umer@@ able volunteer work .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are quite a number of people who support in@@ flo@@ ated asylum seek@@ ers in the city .

Brazil &apos;s p@@ ä@@ di@@ at@@ rische Gesellschaft Rio Grande encourages nutrition for healthy bre@@ ast@@ feeding
the Brazilian organization SP@@ RS is trying to un@@ clear how important good nutrition is during the lac@@ tation period . it does this with the presentation of images of babies , who are painted with depic@@ tions of un@@ healthy food products .
mother &apos;s milk consists of a multitude of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers , their daily cal@@ orie intake increases to increase about 500 cal@@ ories per day .
however , a new research results pointed out that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only di@@ ete@@ tic adaptation that mothers should carry .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ ine College of Medicine in Texas , showed that healthy nutrition pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ors .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can neg@@ ate the immune system negative .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Spor@@ thalle
the community of Bern@@ ried Nu@@ t approved the annual fee for the 2,3 million euros of expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof should be sh@@ ep@@ ed for solar installation .
the plans for the long @-@ long Turn@@ hall@@ en@@ bau at the Bern@@ rie@@ der Sport@@ grounds are step forward for step forward : in the recent community meeting , the elabor@@ ated construction amount has been fitted without great discussions .
previously , the Advisory Board had to place an application for an expansion &quot; exception &quot; / resp@@ ectable &quot; of the valid embry@@ onic plan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we went to permission for a special form in terms of building construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sem@@ it@@ rail@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be built with non @-@ mit@@ e@@ al and Dach@@ stein . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
background the planning is the intended use of the roof surface for solar generators : &quot; thus we get a wonder@@ fully large Sü@@ dd@@ ach , &quot; explained by Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; during the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; again , it went again to the attic that is intended for energetic reasons - different than in the development plan - under ten degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the volume in the hall is significantly reduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan does not allow any &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - with the Bern@@ rie@@ der community usually de@@ tri@@ um@@ bered in case of eman@@ cip@@ ations rather restric@@ tive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is not a recur@@ rent project : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create preced@@ ents , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gym building at the sports centre is a community @-@ project of the municipality and the SV E@@ ried .
some 2.3 million euros have been calculated at a cost .
supplements are expected from school and Bre@@ iten@@ sport promotion .
the next process step , the total amount for the 18 x 36 meter will now be submitted to the Land@@ rats@@ amt for inspection at 18 x 36 meters .
hospital P@@ ei@@ flowing berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ cht@@ berg Hospital is expected to be closed before - namely in 2016 .
at the same time Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes the new director of the Hospital Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the station as well as the majority of the employees go from P@@ ei@@ cht@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this is seeing the un@@ realized plans of the hospital GmbH of the district of the county , the land@@ lady Andrea Joch@@ ner @-@ white confirmed .
the Supervisory Board is , however , the Supervisory Board , and the following Wednesday , 23 September .
if plans are to be implemented , all of the number of 50 employees will continue in the hospital in P@@ ei@@ cht@@ berg .
the vast majority of sol@@ le with fishermen and the further existing inside stop to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are present .
the staff , who can not work with to Sch@@ ong@@ au , should be offered in W@@ eil@@ heim to work , such Joch@@ ner @-@ white .
the employees are informed of the plans .
the change has triggered the cancellation of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , which is only since the beginning of the beginning of the Sch@@ ong@@ au clinic and is now transferred to a private office in immediate vicinity of the hospital .
with the question who planned the follow @-@ up , came to Joch@@ ner @-@ white , the name &quot; fishermen &quot; into the game , who declared to take the guidance on 1 October , and to exchange with his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au pre@@ y this in each case a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recycling &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a wi@@ dening of the offer in the field of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inn@@ ere Medical &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; such Joch@@ ner @-@ white . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for cardi@@ ology and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized in the interior station on gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ologic medicines .
access to the next two years Fischer will bring fishermen with his team , when the Supervisory Board will provide , both homes , until then next year the former hospital in the Kn@@ app@@ ers , which still has 35 beds , in P@@ ei@@ flowing berg to almost 140 years shall be closed .
previously , the country had planned this for 2018 , if the current ongoing refur@@ bish@@ ment was completed at the W@@ eil@@ heim Hospital .
land@@ lady Joch@@ ner @-@ white , who is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board , entered into the house that is owned by the Federal Council , will in future be used as accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I close myself &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; as it continues with the real estate , Joch@@ ner could not say , there are several refl@@ ections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently there are a short term care of the Car@@ itas and a bo@@ de@@ generation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what about it could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come back again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said fishermen about the Qu@@ asi @-@ move to the Le@@ ch , who had been received by the employees &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understanding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house where fishermen has worked for over thirty years as a sur@@ geon , I have not given it .
he had been asked by Sch@@ ong@@ au colleagues to take over the post of medical director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ cht@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was continually threatened with closing , departments have been closed , for example the surgery and the Obst@@ et@@ rics .

refugees need accommodation : study war@@ ns against accomodation
the location on the German residential market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for a paid b@@ room .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
the social housing stands in front of a challenge .
the distribution struggles for the German residential market have long been started .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the in@@ coming refugees and job@@ seek@@ ers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market , which already is already over@@ loaded in many big cities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they compete with income @-@ weak citizens around the last paid apartments .
in order to cover the demand for grad@@ able apartments , there would have to be 400@@ ,000 new units to 2020 each year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at this end , a study comes on behalf of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social housing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for comparison purposes : this year in Germany 26@@ 0,000 units are finished .
thus there are 14@@ 0,000 apartments .
refugees have no longer comm@@ ited after the first three months of their stay , as an asylum seeker in an initial examination to live .
many encounter in the housing market and rows into the long flo@@ cks in front of the rental apartments .
according to the Statisti@@ cal Bundes@@ amt in the last year , however , was less than half of all the asylum seek@@ ers to rent .
however , the negative development of the residential area does not pay only to the rising refugees .
the study also makes considerable om@@ is@@ sions in the housing policy of recent years .
Germany si@@ eves a apartment defic@@ it in front of itself , which gets bigger from year to year .
currently missing in the met@@ ropol@@ itan areas already had around 77@@ 0,000 housing units , indic@@ ted by Matthias Günther , author of the study .
many professionals are therefore located in large cities not@@ ge@@ dr@@ ill@@ ings in WG @-@ rooms .
young adults remained on the dwelling market un@@ avo@@ red longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama . &quot;
in the big cities the number of square meters per head has declined in the last few years .
to solve the problem , the Alliance is propos@@ ing &quot; Social Building &quot; a new start .
in doing so , new incentives are to boost social housing .
so could be w@@ ai@@ ed on the atro@@ cities and the basic tax was suspended for funded apartments resp@@ ectable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , according to the alliance of attractive tax de@@ preci@@ ation , too . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the support programme for refugees and communities of K@@ f@@ W comes already well in towns and villages .
a good week after the start was commen@@ ced at 184 million euros over half of the available around 300 million euros .
now the project could even be re@@ sto@@ cked .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia cor@@ ridor a cor@@ ridor
in Hungary there is practically no more passage , as more refugees choose the road to Croatia .
Zagreb An@@ no@@ ises the passage over Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is still dangerous .
Croatia wants to engage with the neighbouring countries of Slovenia on the establishment of a cor@@ ridor for refugees .
&quot; I talked to the Sloven@@ ian interior , and if it is necessary we will organize a cor@@ ridor , &quot; said the Croatian Interior Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
Slovenia is situated between Croatia and Austria and is one of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU @-@ country Croatia is still no Schengen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the de@@ preci@@ ation of the Ser@@ bian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees dropped to Croatia to get from there to Western Europe .
500 people came across the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reported to the Croatian TV channel RT@@ L .
Hungary had sealed his border for refugees on the day .
new laws which occurred on the same day in force , en@@ umer@@ ated asylum procedure in Hungary practically need@@ less .
Croatia wants to pass the refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic stated : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can travel through and we prepare ourselves for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , women , children and men who want to live and want to achieve something .
but they are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police took up the first refugees from Serbia on the border with Serbia on the border of Serbia .
most st@@ amm@@ ed media reports from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they arrived with the bus as well as with taxis in the Ser@@ bian border town of Si@@ d .
immediately after her arrival she had tried to walk over the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Ser@@ b border , the refugees cannot be held at the border fence .
for this bul@@ ls of fron@@ ts faces other dangers , there are still sharp wi@@ res from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 1990s .
Min@@ en@@ räum@@ er should now quickly create a secure passage .
coming to Hungary after the closure of the border is no more refugees .
on Tuesday the police declared 366 the challenged people .
shortly before the door on Monday it had never been 93@@ 80 .
the new Hungarian laws will reinforce the defeat and damage of the border agreement as a crime .
in the South @-@ Hungarian border of Sz@@ eged , there were 35 criminal proceedings .
the condem@@ ned adhesi@@ on thre@@ aten up to five years and displ@@ ac@@ ement out of the country .
according to the Auth@@ ors Auth@@ orities , one passed on Tuesday to the newly appointed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tran@@ sit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in total 94 asylum ads , of which nearly all - 93 - am the main transition R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among the applic@@ ants are 13 families with small children and two elderly people .
on Mit@@ tw@@ och@@ tomorrow there were 40 refugees left there .
however , there is practically no one granted a view in Hungary and granted asylum .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after an hung@@ arian view , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; insurance third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seek@@ ers should get there de@@ ported .
in front of the &quot; transit @-@ zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke collected only a few hundred refugees .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke began workers to come back .
you gathered the tr@@ ash , the ten thousands of people in the last weeks left at the road@@ side .
Block@@ chain have been clear@@ ed and one of the enc@@ ro@@ dents in the border town was re@@ constructed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the objective of this radical change did not want to express . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Austria is only a few refugees from the border of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
the country also has reinforced its border controls .
around 20,000 migrants were still standing on the country , but still in the country .
in Salzburg there are around 1400 people for continuing driving to Germany .
the German train station from there to Germany was stopped in the morning on the instruction of German authorities .
in free@@ zing there are regularly smaller groups of refugees on foot .
Mayor of the govern@@ ors &quot; about the border
&quot; we were busy following the bridge on Sunday with the clean rooms , when suddenly ten people were standing with camper po@@ ckets at the entrance of the tent , as the Mayor Alois Stad@@ ler .
tourists , they wanted to go by train to Pass@@ au .
because Germany was un@@ employed in Germany on Sunday because of the refuge@@ e stream of railway transport with Austria was stopped for them in Wern@@ stein , &quot; Stad@@ ler , who offered immediately his help and the stu@@ ds together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars about the border into the Middle Pass@@ au .
previously we found the un@@ hop@@ ed guests only once , with J@@ ew and drinks .
we were told the same , we drive them to Pass@@ au by car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was natural for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N conversation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man allowed it to not take a generous donation - 100 Euro for fire@@ men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this has been very happy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the st@@ aff@@ ed traction tracks were re@@ duc@@ ted on Sunday evening in Wels by a ICE in a regional train towards Pass@@ au , in order to get started after the short notice of the train station to Germany , but still to try at the border .
but the regional train was brought down in front of the border in Wern@@ stein am Inn .
in Wern@@ stein is the border @-@ border in general high in the course .
the Br@@ ück@@ en@@ fest association with the Bav@@ arian neighbours on Sunday soci@@ able , days previously a branch @-@ bridge portal - organized by the Union Wern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Viktor Or@@ b@@ án is now sending us more z@@ ig@@ nia , but is a logical result of a seem@@ ing policy : &quot; &quot; &quot;
rather than in the camp R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke right away when building structures to help humanity , our Federal Chancellor outlines very well and publicly the position of Hungarian government in the dun@@ geon of National Soci@@ alism .
Lei@@ d@@ trag@@ e@@ ders of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans , who are now faced in the border areas with cha@@ otic conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the p@@ oul@@ try will find that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gel@@ ted land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they invited and welcome , nothing but another refuge@@ e camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will become a great challenge , given the continuing wave of refuge@@ e currents and the near winter , with us decent @-@ conditions for protective seek@@ ers .
and it will be even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad in search of 3@@ 5.000 wat@@ ering quar@@ z@@ ations
Konrad has filled with the refuge@@ e of refugees to do all his hands .
Christian Konrad is it used to have his word weight .
the government has used the previous mighty Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank , to exp@@ ose Qu@@ arti@@ ere for the thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the premi@@ er center Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already got a grip on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no hom@@ eless more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; told he of his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the accommodation of 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was without great work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and pra@@ ised the organisational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the treas@@ ury spoke of a &quot; cr@@ ack@@ able situation . &quot;
total : Konrad with a need of 8@@ 5,000 quart@@ z in the he@@ ur@@ ged year .
in order to meet the number , you have to be found in the next weeks even 3@@ 5.000 accommodations - 20,000 should provide the countries , 15,@@ 000 of the federal government .
should there be more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is not a cas@@ ks without bott@@ oms &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already held talks with the govern@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they would have warran@@ ted him too , but also for the next refugees quot@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in Ober@@ österreich it runs well , &quot; said Ferry Maier .
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Car@@ dinal Christoph Schön@@ born , seeking to be clari@@ fied , as the church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; great expectations is committed to asylum co @-@ ordin@@ ator to the OR@@ F action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ping as we &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform we can offer private individuals and services .
guests also hopes for hotels that are empty in the winter .
Konrad and Maier previously cri@@ tici@@ zed the standards for accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot;
in an emergency , it could not be that Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ ders must adh@@ ere to some height of the holder or the size of the l@@ esti@@ ck .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a short time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Not@@ ice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; must be regarded . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that he was more successful in contrast to the treas@@ ury in the accommodation itself , he establishes his experience with his experience .
I am an older gent@@ leman , which one does not without further notice the un@@ truth .
pers@@ ever@@ ance is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Maier do not cause any costs as they explained itself .
your staff members want to increase their attention to three to four .
the own lod@@ g@@ ings had not yet been successful .
Konrad wanted to place a container at the Steph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
however , there are clearly problems with the approval .
Linz calls for better distribution
not only opening urban sports halls and other buildings like tips @-@ Arena and design center to accommodate refugees is planning the city of Linz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is currently not necessary , as the people currently able to accommodate those measures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but for emergency purposes , other locations should be checked for their vi@@ ability .
criticism shall be exerc@@ ised by the chef on the division of refugees within the federal state .
other areas must also contribute to their contribution .
Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer : &quot; borders are not sealed . &quot;
in a longer telephone call with the bay@@ ern Prime Minister Horst Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday the further course of action in the refuge@@ e survey .
Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer gave me as@@ sures that the German borders are not sealed .
the continuing education of refugees in the Federal Republic of Germany remains possible .
however , there are now sections corresponding to the corresponding border controls .
special deals with refugees to Germany will not give it no more .
however , the Prot@@ ective seek@@ ers would however be brought to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger called once more increased solidarity in the refuge@@ e question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that now Austria has led to controls again , is a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for wh@@ ist@@ inger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the action of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next R@@ unt@@ astic is a matter of time
the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new ship@@ yard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Lin@@ em@@ ic line is officially completed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the stock company S &amp; T moved , the rest ( 27@@ 00 @-@ square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from technology area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT the clever heads our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; T leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could imagine to invest in start @-@ up companies in the New Wer@@ ft and later also se@@ ated what to act .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already from the outs@@ et S &amp; T he wants to cooperate with new neighb@@ ors - elsewhere in the house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next R@@ unt@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
1,7 million euros have been invested by S &amp; T at the site , 3,3 million euros of the Tech@@ center , which is one third of the city of Linz , the country Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) .
the building has been desp@@ ised by Linz AG for 60 years to S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ center .
30 per cent of 27@@ 00 square metres resi@@ sting in the building are rented apartments , for another 40 percent yield it to requests .

the Br@@ ul@@ lj@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the paths of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose inhabitants are called for .
this property also connects to the billi@@ on@@ aire , who wants to become president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for upright .
whether he has manif@@ ested itself to foreign enemy , journalists , or knowledge of knowledge in the international crisis policy - the applic@@ ant for the U.S. presidential scale wir@@ ing the election campaign .
and cuts well in doing so well .
this is also registered in the pf@@ alz K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the property is made up to date .
the New Yorker with the ren@@ der@@ y is many in the Win@@ zer@@ dorf an der Wein@@ straße .
man@@ cher in the 1200 @-@ inhabitants @-@ site is related to him via -@@ zig corners with him .
his grand@@ si@@ re came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Palat@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in the election campaign .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del turned a movie about Tr@@ ump .
and what do vill@@ agers think about their aim to become emp@@ ow@@ ful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that somehow is thr@@ illing , but in her cas@@ u@@ stad@@ ters are not so deeply impressed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the short@@ ened K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has made a am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous spr@@ ing@@ ling , to which besides Tr@@ ump is also the Ket@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts .
Tr@@ ump , which is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) too word - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in cas@@ u@@ city .
he did not bring it to the king of the hearts .
indeed , there are respect for the performance of the family , but also ten@@ den@@ ial that stret@@ ump is already a bit a grand@@ son , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
random or@@ wise , the nickname , the k@@ all@@ town in the circle I have , &quot; The Br@@ ul@@ lj@@ es@@ macher &quot; - zu High German : die Inn@@ er , says sie .
g@@ ump is therefore from the village of Con@@ fli@@ ers .
the ump of ump of success began in 18@@ 85 , when the later grandfather was hi@@ ked , and opened in the USA a pub for gold @-@ dig@@ gers .
cor@@ nerst@@ one of the real estate concept was first real estate sales in New York .
but the life of grand@@ parents was not free from carrying : their desire to return upon duration to the homeland , failed at the Bav@@ arian State , to which the Palat@@ inate was once belonged .
he did not take tr@@ ump because he once was dra@@ ined without permission , the director of the Institute for pf@@ alz History and People , Roland Paul , became the film start .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal immig@@ rant &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is in contrast to the mit@@ er statements of the descendants .
he repeatedly said to be sus@@ cep@@ tible to Mexican immigrants in the US and required the construction of a border co to prevent illegal immigrants .
&quot; such as the pol@@ ish , that is not so sympath@@ etic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a remote relationship ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a native g@@ ump , the grand@@ pa was new@@ born Heinz &quot; ) .
the win@@ em@@ aker in retirement sees the Americans more dist@@ ancing , &quot; he is always so aw@@ ful . &quot;
believes that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot imagine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has never looked after . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pen@@ sion@@ ers Veronika ; Schr@@ amm men@@ tions such as man@@ finder K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters , that a desc@@ endant of the family Heinz with a visit something for the organ completed , which was generally well attended .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can not imagine the Donald , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is better if he did not eat the choice because &quot; he has such a radical views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had the time of his grandfather in the US the s@@ ages had been , it would have been like he , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there at all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are interesting topics like him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; my president is not &quot; she says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are also ri@@ pe without the President Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Karl Stef@@ ano@@ vic and Lisa Wil@@ k@@ inson &apos;s avenue to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report to the loss of the leadership of the Liber@@ als , but it has no major shi@@ fts in the reviews for Today .

the Rival Sun@@ rise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Saman@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ days , tasted in London as part of a one @-@ week series of international TV shows , which also belonged to Dubai , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
this disadvantage of resistance seemed to be no part to the Australian TV vie@@ wers , since Sun@@ rise has generated average 39@@ 7,@@ 000 spect@@ ators in the five cap@@ itals , compared to the 33@@ 000 .
today , today , a light increase compared to the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17,@@ 000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but his number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today , the gap has concluded the gap to Sun@@ rise in the last few months .
in August Today looks at the average 3@@ 18.@@ 000 in comparison to the 33@@ 0,000 of Sun@@ rise .
at the beginning of the year the distance between 40,@@ 000 and 5@@ 0,000 .
up to now in September Sun@@ rise at the average 34@@ 9,@@ 000 spect@@ ators have come to 3@@ 14.@@ 000 in Today .
this is the most interesting thing happens every morning .

the great novel@@ ty for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial star from Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ard Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama of a recent un@@ wit@@ ted father , who decides to settle , with his two children along the coast of New Zealand , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 219 million vie@@ wers .
critics were wonder@@ ing if Thom@@ son could carry a hit @-@ show solo without the giant Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the outcome of yesterday evening I rep@@ lied to this with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; yes yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million spect@@ ators and hit light The block ( 83@@ 8,@@ 000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26,@@ 000 ) .
seven had mixed results on the evening two by The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17.@@ 30 pm ) of the new qui@@ z show , hosted by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ eping on average 44@@ 6,000 spect@@ ators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 p.m. to 18 : 00 ) j@@ ump@@ ed to 6@@ 23,@@ 000 spect@@ ators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gui@@ res Hot @-@ Seat ( 6@@ 13,@@ 000 ) .
on the end of the evening the first half hour was achieved by The Ch@@ ase Australia 5@@ 20,000 spect@@ ators and in the second half hour was 7@@ 20,000 .
hot @-@ seat at the average of 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline on quot@@ as of the second end of The Ch@@ ase Australia will be confident that Hot @-@ Seat will ultimately be able to en@@ force at 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollar minute that didn &apos;t manage to over@@ wings the Mc@@ Gui@@ res Show .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
mystery revealed ? ...
Lana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ FEL@@ LO@@ WS , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki probably have ir@@ ingly obvious who is winning the Bachelor &apos;s degree .
the woman , at the Sam Wood in The Bachelor of finally lan@@ ded , was covered in greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining boys will certainly not give you , whether to the one who has received the last rose .
but when we are with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and Lana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ FEL@@ LO@@ WS on the day before coming from three two , you might have acci@@ dentally added a hint to who will be the winner .
Sam Wood keeps his lips up until the final on Thursday sealed
all three women have proved their way of why wood is the perfect man and recognized his sense of hum@@ our , am@@ bition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is posed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who should be W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they could become their answers for the game that won the heart of the Bachelor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ FEL@@ LO@@ WS and Mark@@ os@@ ki wet - except itself - M@@ ack@@ ay is the best partner for wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went into the house and ( Sarah &apos;s energies marked , that I noticed that they were fairly compatible and I have thought it throughout the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ FEL@@ LO@@ WS .
&quot; Sarah stands with both feet on Earth , it &apos;s so much fun to be together with her , &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot;
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel pleasant and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple .
from her point of view M@@ ack@@ ay said M@@ ack@@ ay that the visit last week did her clear that wood is the One .
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and the family , it was clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now subject to him , &quot; she said .
and when she was asked to choose to be wood , if not they , there it was pu@@ zz@@ ling .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say it , &quot; she said .
I love the left @-@ made girls equally - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and Lana .
the Bachelor will be on Wednesday , 19 : 30 , , on tennis .

J@@ arr@@ y@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start its N@@ FL career .
Det@@ roit and Seattle were shown great interest after his move into the United States - and there were many other teams sent to his monum@@ ental training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and coach Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a clever decision .
some trainers should have bann@@ ed for the rest of the game on the bank when he lost a Ger@@ angel as it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Rug@@ by League Conver@@ ti@@ t at his first P@@ unt @-@ Return on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Min@@ nes@@ ota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula familiar his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to take a wh@@ unt return and also in the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula still showed his w@@ ah@@ res face in the lo@@ cker room after the game .
instead of creating his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team by the mill , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ s@@ ula en@@ ite Hay@@ ne also publicly available in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Sport@@ re@@ por@@ ter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special teams coordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who ri@@ et his promised f@@ ang and take care of the next game .
J@@ arr@@ y@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t was restored at a p@@ unt , who was restored in the first quarter of the Min@@ nes@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start , the Hay@@ ne and his massive austr@@ alian population for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left after the Fum@@ bling the play@@ field , and told later the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could give himself a bad start into his N@@ FL career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a thing that happens now , you only takes care of the next game and that &apos;s it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne l@@ acks the Schn@@ itzer with his Orig@@ in debut at that time in 2007 , when a pass was conducted at his own in @-@ Go@@ al area for Queens@@ land .

rejected asylum seek@@ ers want to push the Free voters as quickly as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore Ai@@ v@@ anger also demanded more staff for the administration , who are responsible for asylum seek@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum @-@ rec@@ ti@@ ers , &quot; said Ai@@ v@@ anger . &quot; &quot; &quot;

4 people killed , after poli@@ ci@@ ous rubber bul@@ lets on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal shoot .
four people , including a 4 year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police pul@@ led floors in a crowd going against the proposed new constitution , said an official on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on the Saturday evening in the R@@ up@@ an@@ de@@ hi , about 175 miles west of the capital city Kath@@ mandu .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad Dh@@ ak@@ al , Leit@@ ende District Evangel@@ am@@ ter , said that more than 1,000 prot@@ esters have gathered outside a police station , where some of you were given stones and bran@@ dy .
Mr Dh@@ ak@@ al said the police took tears and then shot in the air before they hold on rubber bul@@ lets .
20 Pol@@ ishing and five civilians were wo@@ unded , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the applied rubber rope , of which is known that they may be killing , but they traditionally used as less deadly alternatives appear to appear so high death rate .
the debate was the last in weeks of violent protest in Nep@@ al@@ al south , where members of the ethnic group of M@@ adh@@ esi say that new provinces will be formed within the proposed new constitution , to reduce their political influence .
there were also protests in the Western Nepal of the ethnic group of the Th@@ u , who want to have their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , were in violent struggles since the 10th century .
August 1917 , when the four major political parties agreed to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very contro@@ versi@@ al issue in Nepal , which has been centrally located .

Google starts dou@@ bling donations to collect $ 11 million for refugees
Google Inc ( GO@@ O@@ GL . o ) announced a dou@@ bling donation campaign to aid thousands of refugees from refugees that should help thousands of refugees who en@@ rol@@ ment the European nations as they fle@@ e from war and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ common personal approach in the donation of donations to his blog .
instead of creating a manager the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee , which has escap@@ ed with her family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old , about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of our trips included many dark tracks and bus trips , as well as hunger , thir@@ st , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but since the refuge@@ e and migrants has grown in Europe are looking for many people like my family des@@ per@@ ate for help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; donations do not go to four non @-@ profit organisations that provide help for refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Google said that the first global collected donations has dou@@ bled up to a value of 5.5 million on google.com / amoun@@ ting to 11 million $ .
Europe is faced with its most serious refuge@@ e crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four@@ teen civil war in Syria , which has been driven more than 4 million people this year .
many fires also from the war were dist@@ orted by Afghanistan , Y@@ emen , Iraq and Libya .

for light overweight di@@ abe@@ tics can be a weight loss surgical .
the advantages of weight loss cases for easy over@@ coming people with type 2 diabetes can last for a minimum of five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say if easy overweight people with diabetes after the weight loss surgical procedure live longer than those who do not receive surgical treatments .
&quot; the mort@@ ality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of weight loss surgery , who wrote a editorial article to the new study in J@@ ama Kra@@ kow .
weight loss @-@ surgery or obesity @-@ surgery , use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
you reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s own ability to ab@@ sorb food .
over the years have been adi@@ pos@@ itas @-@ operations for the treatment of type 2 diabetes as efficiently , but most studies were carried out in people who are path@@ y ob@@ ese with a Body Mass @-@ Index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher .
BMI , a degree of weight in relation to size , is considered normal between 18,@@ 5 and 24,@@ 9 .
a BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight , and people with a BMI above 30 are considered ob@@ ese .
you can calculate your BMI here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ an Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data they have collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity and magnets - for medical treatments for type 2 @-@ diabetes among people who were easily over@@ coming .
the average BMI among those who under@@ went this operation , sunk from 31 to 24.@@ 5 until the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile the BMI with those who have no @-@ surgical diabetes treatments received approximately the same at 29 .
under those who subj@@ ected to surgical intervention , the diabetes disease may be wholly and partly in 28 % in case of 28 % .
in the medic@@ ally @-@ treated group , compared to the diabetes were only one per cent , and partly by only two percent .
in addition , the results in the checks of blood pressure , the Tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and the &quot; poor &quot; LD@@ L Chol@@ ester@@ ols &quot; generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , &quot; found the authors .
the researchers also monitored the patient @-@ blood mirror of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c that reflects blood sugar levels over time .
Hä@@ ber@@ glo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c is best held under 7 per cent , write the resear@@ cher .
following the operation s@@ ank the average Hä@@ ber@@ glo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c level of around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
however , in the medical therapy group there remained stable at about 8 per cent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as you are reflected in the improved her@@ etic A@@ 1@@ c Level - decreased not the mort@@ ality in five years , so the guiding researchers Dr. chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also affects average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year the b@@ yp@@ ass surgery group had lost more weight ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , a bigger rel@@ apse during the BMI ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 ) and Hä@@ ber@@ glo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.@@ 1 % vs. 2.@@ 1 % ) and recorded a complete over@@ coming from the diabetes ( 46.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show a survival of the surgery after five years , there is indications of a study of he@@ avier people in Sweden , that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , it was under@@ ne@@ sted individuals who under@@ go an obesity , roughly 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group , which was conventional methods .
although the new study showed no benefit for the survival of the surgery @-@ patients , Black@@ stone said , it is soo@@ thing for persons with a BMI below 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BMI below , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without increasing risk of death or kid@@ ney disease , she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should begin taking weight seriously as soon as the patient is with his BMI between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we wait too long until we take people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think that once these genetic changes have accumul@@ ated these genetic changes that have linked their bodies with obesity and diabetes is a revers@@ al really hard . &quot;

&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
Europe cannot take all refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real resolution of the refuge@@ e crisis in the Middle East .
the Tibetan @-@ Buddh@@ ist leaders sat down to end violence in the home countries of refugees .
the Dalai Lama spoke the issue of lasting refuge@@ e crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visits to the United Kingdom in his speech at the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford , which is devoted to eth@@ ic studies .
he called for the interests of humanity by the interests of individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of the West European countries around the refuge@@ e crisis may be ad@@ orable , but the situation is not adequ@@ ately be correct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama was pra@@ ised in Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to tackle the crisis , he stressed that it is just a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousands of refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long term solutions , such as a true peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ultimately , we must re@@ think about how the killing can be reduced in their countries .
we need to reduce the use of force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence has never solved problems &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama spoke the problem of violence and commented that George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack on September 11 and introduced the violent reaction of the US into a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my letter to President Bush in a letter to President Bush and I told him the way to solving this problem lies in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he put violence and this has un@@ expected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four @-@ fold rise from taking hand inf@@ ect@@ ants by children during the past 4 years
po@@ ison valve centers in the USA reports on an almost 400 @-@ percent increase in the number of children under 12 years , which sm@@ ells a alcoh@@ olic beverage inf@@ ect@@ ant , so that Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , sti@@ ched the cases of revenue of hand@@ des@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years to report po@@ ison centers , from 3.@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; children are becoming more common to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go up in emer@@ um@@ ption , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N .
he said that some children dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants v@@ ast@@ ed drink , while some of them do to impress their friends or because of a shar@@ pen@@ ing in the social media .
show videos on YouTube as young people dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants only because of a cheap experience .
you@@ ths are supposed to be dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant with alcohol @-@ bearing mouth@@ wash to get a tough@@ er drink .
younger children can become infected with attractive sc@@ ents of the dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez .
many of the more attractive ( hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those who are par@@ amount .
there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange @-@ showers that are very pleas@@ ing for children .
hand@@ sh@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant contains somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially for small children , a few sc@@ are can result in an alcohol de@@ to@@ xi@@ fication .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Stephen Th@@ orn@@ ton , medical Director of the po@@ ison centre in the hospital centre of Kan@@ sas , the Sender Fox 4 in Kan@@ sa City . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , you would not let go whis@@ ky whis@@ ky , but people let this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come to it , then it &apos;s a quick way to consume much alcohol .
N@@ hai@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year girl , which had recently taken four spl@@ ash of after straw@@ berry du@@ f@@ ten@@ ders in the school , was brought into an emergency treatment .
your blood @-@ alcoh@@ centr@@ ation was 179 , twice higher than the thres@@ hold , which is under an adult legal than dr@@ unk , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor , who examined it at the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ hai@@ jah l@@ all@@ te their words and was unable to go as she arrived at the time .
doctors monitoring them overnight in a separate children &apos;s Hospital on signs of deer @-@ trau@@ ma , since the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had b@@ ushed the head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was very wor@@ ris@@ ome , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ tor@@ ia Scott , N@@ hai@@ yuan &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have fat@@ al for my child .
Lop@@ ez has parents and teachers recommended to use non @-@ alcoh@@ olic and inf@@ ect@@ ants and inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
over alcohol ad@@ ox@@ i@@ fication also were connected to dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with deaths .
in 2013 two women died in Ontario , after the s@@ wal@@ low of hand@@ bags , which ent@@ ru@@ sted an tox@@ ic , non @-@ kl@@ ari@@ ed ingre@@ dient .
employees of health authorities susp@@ ect that the product meth@@ anol has mat@@ ured for a deadly solution instead of eth@@ anol , which was listed as an active substance .
in January @-@ three students of the fourth grade in the State New York , their &quot; m@@ ented &quot; teacher said to de@@ to@@ xi@@ fy their &quot; bacter@@ ial products around the class@@ room , &quot; said it a police report .

it is because the Rang@@ ers are not there .

you can talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested .
there is a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and it is not just the people in Scotland that want to see these games .
I will turn the things turned aside .

we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know it is very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad over what happens .
we feel this exactly so - but we need to go on .
we really need to really get the support from Celtic because that makes the player better .

he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
the invitation was already opened in January over his best friend , and although I was sho@@ cked , I agreed .
when the day came closer , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed , because I thought it would be a good opportunity to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would provide a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists will be able to see Hin@@ du in the United States , and as many times more applications are available than places , a macro lot@@ tery will take place in order to decide who is chosen .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media outlets from 12 to five .
who is chosen will watch it emotional .
I cannot do that .
I will sit next to Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ ps of my boyfriend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephone numbers and a two @-@ hour visit .
I like the guy .
we laugh@@ ing much when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to make a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma acc@@ ented me on Twitter , my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the shepherd , how he wants it , and you will get access .
I protect me with her .
they sp@@ them that they could have &quot; it better form@@ ulate , &quot; but they still think it is wrong , what I do .
Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ p has problem with some of the things I have said and wrote .
he does not tell me what I have written and I would not do it even if he would do it .
I said to him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants that an international re@@ por@@ ter is present to write there .
if he dies , he thinks that publicity work of the movement will help to death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ port@@ eur of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts that I have made .
I don &apos;t want to go down here again .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ p is in@@ no@@ cent .
his actions after the murder of Bar@@ ry Van Tre@@ ese would be guilty to be a benefici@@ ary of de@@ ed .
but I believe that a strong probability is that he is not guilty of the murder .
I &apos;m sure there is no enough evidence to justi@@ fy a death row .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I can not claim to be truly obj@@ ectively .
there will be other por@@ ters to which you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to die a man an un@@ necessary death .
man after hum@@ idi@@ fier @-@ boat race sur@@ rendered to come from the Cann@@ ing River
the Cann@@ ing V@@ ale Poli@@ z@@ ist remained dry , when he sp@@ ake the man of the Cann@@ ing River .
an attempt of a man from Per@@ th to mis@@ hang the police , was un@@ successful , when it was in sil@@ ken and mar@@ sh@@ y water , just a few meters away from a police button , the tried to walk , &quot; walk gently , to the shore . &quot;
the police of Cann@@ ing V@@ ale was established on Tuesday to a household break @-@ in occurrence in Beck@@ er@@ ham .
when they discovered the susp@@ ects , trying to escape them toward the Cann@@ ing River .
but he did not come too far .
&quot; he stood in the water and said &apos; I do not come out , com@@ m and ho@@ l me , &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant Sh@@ and@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine .
Con@@ stable Sal@@ lan Per@@ hav@@ ec was not too keen to make its unique shape , so he turned a depend@@ able tac@@ tic - &quot; A good police task is negoti@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine .
Master@@ classes Ben Cous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 c@@ ous@@ ins spend his car in the dit@@ ch to escape to a alcohol control and then tried to swim over the Swan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful but inspired locals to the humor@@ ous planning of a Ben Cous@@ ins @-@ Bi@@ athlon .
Peter Moo@@ dy claimed that St@@ ew@@ ards sought to exp@@ ose him and dro@@ ves the race sport
Peter Moo@@ dy claimed that St@@ ew@@ ards from Racing Victoria tried to install a sp@@ y in his st@@ ables last year and dro@@ p@@ ly to finish the race immediately .
he aimed at the st@@ ew@@ ards and the management department of Racing Victoria and claimed it was a personal campaign against him with the scr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a racing course treatment , the last stra@@ w @-@ half on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy said to Fair@@ fax Media , that he has always tried to do what is best for the racing sport and he found himself under difficult conditions as it was about the positive co@@ b@@ alt train@@ ee at Li@@ dar@@ is that he cannot explain .
he had with@@ held 18 months because of the es@@ pi@@ on@@ age su@@ ck and did not want to see it as much as high hanging grapes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say anything about it , and I have long to eat after it , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything at once comes out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you know that it continues .
sometimes one re@@ acts , and one has to live with the consequences and I must live with them what I have said .
I will go home ton@@ ight and sleep well .
I want to go out of the main ones , and I want my owners think that I try my best for them .
if they begin to think I do not do that , then I should not be a trainer .
I don &apos;t have to think about what I do with my license .
previously , Moo@@ dy had the Bom@@ b in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , that the department of integration had tried to go@@ ose his barn .
&quot; prior to eigh@@ teenth months sa@@ h Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian St@@ ew@@ art in a room with a man - whom I will be asked - and give him an employment in my st@@ ables to deliver information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said Mo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com
they believe that I am a che@@ at .
if that is the case , they should certainly be tou@@ ching their n@@ oses because they attempt to sei@@ ze me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , eh@@ em . Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ die , acting President of R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of the R@@ V@@ L , were aware of the time and are still today .
should I bring me to the view , that it will be personally ?
did the R@@ V@@ L be@@ have been celeb@@ rates and makes people responsible outside trainers who proceed in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe the people think out there I am .
maybe they have to take me my licence and I will fail me , and I have no doubt that what I say , they are now thinking about it .
but I am now at the point where I am no matter of , and that makes me sad .
this really makes me sad .
I will put pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the Fru@@ ter@@ ations @-@ levels of the Train@@ ers have built up with the long @-@ lasting Kob@@ alt examination at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching led to it that he could throw his license over the table . &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the un@@ fail@@ ing master Black Caviar , awarded the racing tags @-@ treatments &quot; ri@@ dic@@ ulous &quot; after a pack had been applied to the hor@@ ror , what was ru@@ sted against the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my staff has mis@@ used mud on the leg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been so yesterday evening .
it could have been so yesterday the whole day , whatever it was .
it was also so on the race .
Moo@@ dy could be faced with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack on the race day . a study of this matter has been opened .
it is a joke .
people who raise these rules don &apos;t know anything about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here one is too far gone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
man under the cur@@ ator was arrested .
on the weekend , the police have put a man after a cl@@ ash with a cycl@@ ist and subsequent ride away in Cob@@ ram .
the cycl@@ ist has been supplied with the hel@@ ic@@ opter into the Royal Melbourne Hospital with heavy inj@@ uries after he was hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Mur@@ ray Valley motorway .
the police said , the driver went on , without stopping , to help the last rider .
on Monday a 50 year old man stood out of Nath@@ alie &apos;s police in Sh@@ ep@@ ad .
he is expected to be charged for cur@@ sed and supp@@ ressed Hil@@ fel@@ ine and of other public delicate .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ am@@ y proposes to fight Rival because of claims
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ am@@ y has written criticism of the tac@@ kling of his players as &quot; Agenda @-@ Sett@@ ing &quot; of two Premier League favorites of the R@@ RL .
Sydney Ro@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the arbit@@ rat@@ ors won the Storm @-@ players &quot; ring fighters &quot; with his team during the High Storm seal in Sydney on the Fri@@ day@@ evening .
Bris@@ bane Bron@@ cos Trainer Victoria B@@ enn@@ ett made a hardly disgu@@ ised note to the Storm team , after his team had reached the final victory against North Queens@@ land cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; sample &quot; of the Rug@@ by League and said that the two Queens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in the singing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ am@@ y defended the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his team and said that they are concentr@@ ating on tac@@ kling only on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ am@@ y added that the criticism of two leading co@@ aches at his team agree with him , as it would de@@ vote that they were trou@@ bled to become be@@ aten by the Storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the emerg@@ es again and again - I did not hear that Tr@@ ent Robinson has spoken about ring fighters than they left us 24 : 2 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Bell@@ am@@ y on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that in the whole year we have changed nothing at our defensive system or techniques . but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with tactics to a real emphasis and that has provided for us the retreat .
Tr@@ ent has now been there for three years and he obviously has a great team to exercise . he therefore probably did not get used to lose , so it was a bit a shock for him .
it is already funny , as this always emerg@@ es again at this time of the year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ am@@ y has attacked the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exciting football &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and his ment@@ or remin@@ ds that B@@ enn@@ ett St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dragon won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bo@@ red &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wayne is speaking of exciting football .
he was compared his game on Saturday evening with our on Friday evening and how exciting her game was , &quot; said Bell@@ am@@ y .
I remember that in 2010 St George was cri@@ tici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wayne said that he will take care of a divor@@ ce .
but now he has a team that can play and that we consider as a thr@@ illing , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the Ball@@ room that you want to play when you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt , so they can play them .
I build stronger trust , because they say these things because they are a bit worried , to play against us .
six weeks ago they did not think of us when the Big Games went .
Bell@@ am@@ y pointed out that the game Storm vs Ro@@ sters a higher result achieved as the game Bron@@ cos against Cow@@ boy .
the game of the Bron@@ x was probably a good game , I have not seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more trials in our game , but is that an exciting game ?
or are breaks make and no points a bit more exciting ?
for me it is the maps .
when they mention us , it means that in a phase we will meet again .
the Team member has released this weekend because they have won the right to receive either North Queens@@ land cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks on the next Saturday night in the fin@@ als at the A@@ AMI Park . the ticket sales begin on the next day of the morning .
Ser@@ bier with 200@@ .000 $ Deposit to Drug Ad@@ diction
a man that maybe a life @-@ long punishment is threatened because of its temp@@ tation to come into possession of 40 k@@ ilo@@ grams of co@@ ca@@ ine coming to Queens@@ land , was released against a damages deposit of 200@@ .000 $ .
Marko Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men , the last month was arrested , after the federal government found 100 kg of the drug on the Yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America via V@@ anu@@ at@@ u and met in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed as he met his co @-@ acc@@ used in the marina and later at the Café Co@@ om@@ era Ro@@ adh@@ ouse where the police took 40 k@@ ilo@@ grams of drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite a possibly li@@ fel@@ ong punishment for the attempt to possess a commercial amount of Kok@@ ain , argu@@ ed the attorney of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic that he tried to possess the entire quantity and that in the cafe for a harm@@ less reason might have been .
the judge of the Supreme Court of Justice , Peter Flan@@ agan , was worried about the f@@ ancy of mac@@ si@@ mo@@ vic .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
he often travelled to Serbia , &quot; he explained the court on Wednesday .
in the case of prosec@@ uted , he was bel@@ lied with the police on his position .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ cs mother and step@@ father had a deposit of 200,000 dollars as security together to reach its release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the full explanations of the two people it is clear that the edition of a security of 200,000 dollar represents a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said F@@ agan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone will not suff@@ ice to hold him away , not to appear , war@@ ned he .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was fre@@ ed against deposit under the conditions that he announces his Australian and his Ser@@ b Pass to be mer@@ ged with police in 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .

Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g picked up the phone of the girl , than this as@@ le@@ ep , log@@ ging into an online mess@@ aging service that received a number of ir@@ relevant pictures of children who were sent to him by another user .
the girl wo@@ ke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sle@@ epy H@@ og@@ g .
it looked through , the conf@@ using reports and al@@ ar@@ dised immediately found her mother .
the police took care of it and saw the five images , analysed then computers that were found under the address and found &quot; specific web research that used terms for the search for un@@ decent pictures of children .
H@@ og@@ g said then against the officials that he did it , since it would lead to &quot; P@@ äd@@ oph@@ ile in the internet , &quot; and then he called &quot; a polic@@ eman a politi@@ cian to be trou@@ bled . &quot;
the State K@@ ili@@ ie Rober@@ ts@@ on said the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be a ad@@ diction that he ad@@ dic@@ tive to sc@@ are people .
he called for the S@@ he carried out on the computer of him , but he said it was to be done , because he wanted to claim a polic@@ eman a politi@@ cian to be trou@@ bled .
he asked for his conversation with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and he asked to send more photos .
he said he did it to cur@@ l them .
he said he is sick of his head , when he tr@@ apped , and said , he wants to see pictures of rap@@ e and murder .
Ms Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was on tre@@ m@@ bling and in the wine .
it also saw the in@@ decent pictures on the phone and con@@ front the acc@@ used with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the def@@ endant computer and Play@@ station uses to speak with girls who looked much younger than he .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Secretary @-@ At@@ tor@@ Gregor S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g does not appear in the register of sexual offen@@ ders , as we can ar@@ gue that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be found in his conversation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ wit@@ zer@@ ob the judgment of October to October , to get background information about social work .

the mass makes it : every two years the high@@ lighting at the I@@ AA tell its novel@@ ties .
2015 is primarily attributed to exercise during the compact days which are currently especially well sold .
cars from the compact class are currently wonder@@ ed : about 28,@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations were reported according to the U.S. office ( KBA ) alone in August at this segment .
this is also reflected in the I@@ AA ( audience period 17 to 27 September ) .
between all the fut@@ ur@@ istic concept vehicles and new super@@ cl@@ ues and luxury cars are presented this year especially many new compact models .
one of the biggest premi@@ er for the German car industry is the Opel Astra which will be in the fall of the dealers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Astra model for us is an extremely important model , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann in the fair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is part of the mark of the mark .
in order that the volume model is also well sold , the new Astra is also not much more expensive .
Opel is launching an introduction below the biggest competi@@ tor VW Golf in view , which starts at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra is available from 16 990 .
Astra is available with a new 1 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 PS .

other than the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus there is the Opel Astra first only as five stars .
a second variant will follow in the spring of the Kom@@ bi , which is already visible at the I@@ AA .
and what will be suspended next to Astra on the I@@ AA even at new compact ou@@ les ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of his Astra Mé@@ gan@@ e into the race .

J@@ VA Berlin @-@ T@@ egel : five square meters ) are deser@@ ted
the Federal Constitu@@ tional Court has given a Ex @-@ H@@ äf@@ e@@ ling of the inde@@ pen@@ al ch@@ ment which was accommod@@ ated in a small cell .
because of the violation of their human rights , prisoners are generally eligible for financial compensation , when they are contained in small cells .
this has decided the Bundes@@ ver@@ fassungs@@ gericht in an on Wednesday published decision .
the suffer@@ ers may even hope to have the judges even if they were imprison@@ ed within a few days in close rooms ( AZ . : 1 Bv@@ R 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
there@@ with , a former prisoners with his constitutional complaint successfully completed in Karlsruhe : he was accommod@@ ated in the Berlin @-@ course of Berlin @-@ T@@ egel between June and November 2009 in a cell of around five square feet of ground surface ; the toilet was sp@@ atial not separate .
after that , the man , who had after the indications of his st@@ rolling , now came back on an open leg , in a larger cell that has been moved .
his am@@ alg@@ amation with respect for the land of Berlin is due to its am@@ alg@@ amation conditions .
but the rec@@ ti@@ fier took up the judgment of the Chamber of Justice Berlin and instruc@@ ted to return the case to the renewed examination .
you will see the man &apos;s dignity .
Kammer@@ dish now determines the amount of compensation
even if for legal reasons of the frag@@ ile period only a few days of course for the compensation shall be decisive , whether a equ@@ ation was given , it was meant .
otherwise , &quot; an enc@@ ro@@ led of the legal protection of the personality could be fear@@ ed . &quot;
the Chamber of Kammer@@ Court must now clarify the amount of the money hair .
the constitutional ver@@ ters have often been reinforced in the past often the rights of prisoners .
so they said only in April a shepherd , because he was naked in a cell , was locked in a cell .
human un@@ worthy is a decision of 2011 according to the multi@@ purpose of a cell without a separate toilet .
in addition , Karlsruhe confirmed the Berlin Constitu@@ tional Court , who decided to establish a decent @-@ condition in a Parall@@ el@@ fall in November 2009 .
the dam@@ ar Kl@@ äger was opened over three months a day between 15 to 21 hours in a similar cell like in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
the Berlin pr@@ isons had also come into head@@ lines over the past few weeks .
prisoners are therefore always included 23 hours , the aggressi@@ vity does , even to bat , it should have already been due to the ten@@ se situation .
according to information of the com@@ press@@ ors and there are 21 places in T@@ egel because of junior leaders , 19 should fall away down in 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refuge@@ e policy : &quot; we create the &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immigration of refugees is a huge challenge - the German Chancellor is determined to accept them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is coming to Germany
some 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany according to forecasts of the Federal Ministry of Germany after Germany , according to statement by Vi@@ zek@@ anz@@ ler Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SD@@ P ) , Germany is even able to record a million refugees .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated in view of the unusual challenge : &quot; I say to you again and again : we can do this and we create it . &quot;
what to do in Germany gives an overview of the following overview .
needed for different forecasts between 3@@ 500@@ 00 ( estim@@ ation of the Federal Ministry of Finance ) and 400@@ 000 ( estim@@ ation of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) , namely the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it has been built ( 25@@ 0000 apartments ) .
dramatic is the lack of living @-@ living space , but above all in pass@@ able rental persons : yearly from 600@@ 00 to 800@@ 00 social housing from the lease of prices , and for these particularly favourable apartments will also apply refugees .
the Bundes@@ land@@ erin Anne Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) is intended to double the support of nearly 518 million to one billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; much too little is that from the perspective of the P@@ est@@ el institute : 80 000 social housing have to be created annually , and that the federal government would have to promote funding of € 6.4 billion per year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , scientists and the Federal State of the Federal State of Germany have to give that there must also be more tax benefits for investments in the construction of housing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Institute of labor market research and occupational research , 55 percent of the p@@ oul@@ try in Germany can be employed in the long term . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , refugees in Germany would not even ask for their qualifications to help them succeed , critic@@ ised Claudia Walter , project manag@@ er@@ ess for integration and education in the Bert@@ els@@ mann foundation .
but for the integration of refugees is decisive whether they will find employment in Germany .
work is the key of social contacts , for the esteem in the centre society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of the immigrants , says Mig@@ r@@ ulation for@@ scher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt .
according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt , it has given a political shift to Thr@@ än@@ hardt : from labor ver@@ bot for refugees in recognition of work .
while earlier , there was a working ban for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this in November 2014 was reduced to three months , as well as the resi@@ dences , the asylum seek@@ ers to a place of residence .
in society , even because of the lack of skilled workers , the approach is increasingly transparent that refugees should be made possible to access the labour market .
a great hur@@ d@@ le for access to the labour market is missing .
up to now , there is still no bo@@ iling offering of general and professionals @-@ related language courses .
studies also show that jobs most often handled by personal contacts .
the building of networks is therefore based on the view of Thr@@ än@@ hardt of the King@@ s@@ weg .
the Berlin school administration has established that only a few students their children fall into the Kit@@ as , estimated at ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the ent@@ ro@@ oting parents , it is only very important to hold the family , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ sch@@ em@@ bar , speaker for youth and family in the Berlin Senate administration .
to convince the family from the advantages of the K@@ ita , the management of manual works in different languages .
should the need to rise to educ@@ ators through the great number of refugees , the Berliner Senate would increase the training capacity - about by increasing more technical colleges .
in the countries students will be prepared without the knowledge of welcome classes in the classes .
but they are not always instruc@@ ted by fully trained teachers , but also , as in Berlin , also by instruc@@ tors who only have one qualification in English as a second language .
there is no short@@ age , says Be@@ ate St@@ ations of the Berlin school administration .
the German Student@@ en@@ werk appreci@@ ates that approximately 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study .
basically , no state asylum seek@@ ers or Ged@@ ult@@ ing the study - the only exception was so far Berlin , inter@@ sen@@ ator Frank H@@ enkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned its position .
studies in refugees could be facilit@@ ated with the access to the university .
for refugees with a rep@@ ay@@ ment or Dul@@ c@@ isation , no services are received after the asylum Act more , if they start studying .
the latter basically received no BA@@ Fö@@ G as it does not fall under the circle of the wicked people .
patient refugees have had to have been lived in Germany for four years to be eligible for BA@@ Fö@@ G @-@ eligible , from 1st January 2016 to the short@@ ens to 15 months .
but also this financing will however be closed , Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin@@ s State Secretary for Science , and the German Student@@ en@@ werk .
students should immediately get BA@@ Fö@@ G .
Islam will play a more important role in the future because many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should follow Islam succ@@ essi@@ vely the same rights as they have the churches , and the existing state @-@ Ch@@ urches have to develop further to a new state of religions .
it would be important also in the establishment of an Islamic welfare association , who takes care of the curiosity of Neu@@ k@@ iss@@ ors .
and the rights also belong obligations .
so the representatives of Islam have to be prepared in a clear contact person and are willing to cooperate with the state in many areas and to provide certain control possibilities .
this also includes the willingness to work together against religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Ma@@ zy@@ ek , vo@@ iced on Thursday the concern , religious conflicts could also be hin@@ dered to Germany .
those who wanted to do such conflicts in Germany , &quot; have immediately their right to wei@@ gh here in Germany , &quot; he said in the Bay@@ rische Rundfunk .
he suggested to translate the Basic Law on arab@@ ic .
integration will continue to be a topic of the whole society in the future .
in doing so , the majority of society will have to change , the elimination of discrimination and racism .
Germany has - as a result of European decisions - since a decade @-@ discrimin@@ atory field and a general gender equality law .
but it goes very slowly , as the NS@@ U @-@ M@@ ord@@ series showed , in the police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist mot@@ if .
equal opportunities for all : what mig@@ rant workers and stakeholders have long for a long time , and for what international agreements are to be realised in the coming years if the country will remain peaceful and use its new citizens - for the benefit of all .
generally speaking , Germany is able to supply the past expected refugees in medic@@ ally , as for ag@@ g@@ ass@@ ing president Frank Ulrich Montgomery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what energy and capacity is concerned , we create it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , there are extra money to flow into the system .
to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Montgomery , all starter , immediately on registration Health cards to be suspended .
brought services later to the federal states could be settled .
and in the long term it is highly question@@ able so many people saw the limited performance catalogue that the asylum seek@@ ers can see .
otherwise , the physicians do especially to create the language barriers .
already so far , so far the Berlin health resear@@ cher@@ ist The@@ a Bor@@ de proved to be worse compared to their disease than other patients .
not only in clinics , also in the doctors , would have to apply interpre@@ ters costs , she asks for .
for many refugees too , many refugees had already been helped with more universal medical pro@@ gression in the ambul@@ ance out@@ patient .
and with another diagnostic view .
in refuge@@ e camps , there were clearly more untreated disabilities and during the young people it is about HIV @-@ clarification .
with the partly other illness images , German doctors made by their training but clearly , Cameron .
&quot; paras@@ ites or tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis are not as hard to recognize . &quot; and what the anger is concerned , be by the refugees actually even relief in sight .
Sy@@ rer has had a sophisticated educational system , et@@ tish refugees or even doctors .
to practi@@ se practic@@ ing , however , they must ref@@ rain their qualification and ref@@ itted again exam@@ ining .
at least half of the refugees in Germany , according to the mis@@ ery of therapy ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) psych@@ ologically sick , most of them suffer from a post traum@@ atic exposure to depression or depression .
particularly vulnerable , refuge@@ e camps , explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recent study of TU München demonstrates that every fifth of Syrian refugees sh@@ trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
wh@@ o@@ ever is suffering from a post traum@@ atic aber@@ ration , suffering from among other things , is suffering from so @-@ called Fl@@ ash@@ backs with respir@@ ation , flo@@ od@@ ds , heart@@ beat and bl@@ aze .
further symptoms are sleeping and concentr@@ ations , strong sc@@ ary and emotional de@@ af .
to prevent the symptoms of chronic , be an early treatment necessary , explained Mun@@ z .
however , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically @-@ sick refugees receive a psycho@@ therapy .
although psychological ill @-@ seeking asylum seek@@ ers to put an application for a psycho@@ therapy , but it usually takes several months to work .
in addition , in the social offices mostly Sach@@ be@@ workers or physicians who are not trained for psych@@ ic diseases , decide if a therapy is necessary or not .
this is often lead to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites to dream
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the new st@@ aging &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the circ@@ us attack on the traditions of circ@@ us art . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal is to draw any age group in the spell of fascinating Ak@@ rob@@ atics , wildlife and unique entertainment .
now the Circus Pro@@ ven in the arena of bri@@ cks and was@@ ps to dream .
&quot; our passion is the circ@@ us . &quot;
&quot; I cannot imagine living without my circ@@ us family , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ ven , animal instructor , and juni@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - under this motto the current amount is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dream &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for more than 33 years the circ@@ us is in the hands of the family .
so the gift to the am@@ aze is the family in the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; us it is important to get people away from their everyday life and to take them for two hours into a completely different world , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; st@@ resses the 27 @-@ year junior orch@@ est@@ rated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Man@@ asse@@ h cock@@ tail with the world city @-@ flair &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says director Reinhard Pro@@ ves his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities in the nearly 3 000 km long tour can now experience this flair .
the programme of the circ@@ us impres@@ ses with talented artists from around the world .
excellent at the International circ@@ us festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ ar C@@ low@@ n Family moves the audience with w@@ oven and charm in their spell .
also the Castillo Bro@@ thers are understanding their crafts@@ manship .
with the heroes of the silent movies there will be the Cu@@ ban duo .
ligh@@ tness and mot@@ ility - with these words they identify themselves .
her humor@@ ous Art at the mast is to con@@ quer women &apos;s storm in storm .
except for numerous Sal@@ mon @-@ sal@@ mon , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of Circus also gives you with finger@@ sp@@ it@@ alism and artic@@ ulations .
to balance bike on a sphere ?
for He Yuan no problem .
sn@@ ak@@ men int@@ ri@@ gu@@ ing and timi@@ ze at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest kind of ac@@ rob@@ atics , like little other and fascinated with their flexibility .
60 employees from twelve nations provide variety in every sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the animals belong to our family &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; st@@ resses Steph@@ an@@ ies &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ ven . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mis@@ conditions in the attitude of circ@@ us are only too often issue at various animal welfare organizations .
Steph@@ anie Pro@@ ves also adop@@ ts the position : &quot; it is not good for our animals , it is also not good . &quot;
approximately 80 animals from five different continents enjoy every string unit .
the four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ stes , as they are lov@@ ingly called , is read by the possibility of every desire from the eyes .
we want to cooperate with animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel comfortable , it does not want to take it into the arena .
the upper@@ spot therefore : good for the animals care .
especially on her z@@ eb@@ roid Jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land Pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a Zeb@@ ra@@ stu@@ te , the family is proud .
the two animals have lived eight years in a c@@ ages and nothing is happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , was our little Jum@@ bo da , &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ ven .
the z@@ eb@@ roid is not yet ready for the arena , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of Circus Pro@@ ven .
so for each visitor , this is likely to be something there .
&quot; one is certain , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ ce : &quot; no matter if five or 1 200 vie@@ wers , we always give our best and are with all your heart . &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ ven loads from 17 to 20 September daily at 5 pm and 8 pm on the performances .
on Sunday the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
Thursday is family day , for the performance around 17 o &apos;clock the prices are reduced .
the Ti@@ ersch@@ au is open daily from 10 am to 6 pm .
Sim@@ bab@@ w@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe keeps incorrect talk in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , African El@@ t@@ ester leader , right in the beginning of the year from a po@@ dium down the stairs .
he remained un@@ folded , but the video of the case has quickly spread on the social media .
the parliament &apos;s opening was also mar@@ red by declar@@ ations of the opposition they had received anonymous death threats and they were fore@@ war@@ ned to accompany the address of Mr Mu@@ gabe with Bu@@ hr@@ eps .
last month she lost him and was interrupted by his speech on the situation of the nation in the parliament - this is the speech he re@@ peti@@ tive on Tuesday .
the spok@@ es@@ person of the movement for democratic change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent gon@@ ese said that seven Op@@ positions @-@ politi@@ cian sent messages to their phones that they war@@ ned to worship Mr. Mu@@ gab@@ es to her language .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it does not have the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; death &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said journalists after the muck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they war@@ ns the EP members that end the imm@@ unity in parliament and once they leave the parliament , their parliamentary imm@@ unity is no longer effective .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the boss said the party &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Morgan Ts@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i guided party &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the threats to politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ ew@@ let@@ t @-@ Pack@@ ard will build up to 3@@ 0,000 jobs
H@@ ew@@ let@@ t @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to settle 25,000 to 3@@ 0,000 jobs in the framework of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services .
HP is later divided into two listed companies later this year and separate the computer and printer business from its fast growing business hardware and its service activities .
the expected job vac@@ anci@@ es leads to a load of more than 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , HP said in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this restructuring measures will allow more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ let@@ t @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chairman and Chief Executive , which should lead the unity after the separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ let@@ t Pack@@ ard Enterprise is smaller and more focused than it is HP today and we have a wide and deep@@ est portfolio of shops that support companies in transition to a new style of business . &quot;
as a stand@@ alone company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
H@@ ew@@ let@@ t Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; is focused on providing so far @-@ achiev@@ able technology solutions for companies , &quot; such an explanation of the company .
it shares a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30@@ s by the gradu@@ ates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ let@@ t and Dave Pack@@ ard and whose Pal@@ o Alto Garage was named &quot; the birth@@ place of the Sili@@ con Valley . &quot;
HP has gone through a massive restructuring to master the conversion of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
the measure of HP , the worldwide second @-@ largest PC @-@ manufacturer and one of the biggest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this field that based on conviction that closely focused companies perform better performance .
FC Arsen@@ al @-@ captain Mac@@ el Art@@ el says that teamwork is placed in front of the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger pointed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it is first in September and provided that his rehabilitation goes to Plan , there is no reason why he cannot play before Christmas before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England and in view of its history , its participation in the next summer is certainly un@@ certain .
the great shame on this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had badly ended the last season after a separate an@@ kles breach , and then returned to its old momentum during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury is not threat@@ ening the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone , which is not well heal@@ ed .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not related to his an@@ kles or with the inj@@ uries he had previously .
this may be true from purely medical view , but like turning , there is a related danger of further inj@@ uries , always when a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it is also developed an uncomfortable pattern .
the study of Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd explo@@ res 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in just 65 of ar@@ sen@@ als 157 lig@@ as@@ pi@@ ps in the last five seasons .
the wider image of ar@@ sen@@ al is that in six of eight seasons , since 2007 / 08 , one of the two Premier League clubs were to draw the most vulner@@ abilities .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a hot@@ shot , but ar@@ sen@@ al believes that an improvement in the injury is ongoing during the last season .
&quot; sometimes , if you come back from an injury , you have a random period of time , a time when you have to strengthen your body and gain strength , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
Jack is young enough to overcome the .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will run a career of the way he deserves .
ar@@ sen@@ al begins its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb before playing against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ sp@@ ur the next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger presents itself a rotation within the team .
Hé@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey did not travelled to Croatia , what means Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ uch@@ y and Art@@ eta start to start .
Wen@@ ger can also begin with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Post@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and give players who need it , a little p@@ ann@@ ed off , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
although ar@@ sen@@ al are clear Favorites , by group F further , the Mak@@ si@@ mir @-@ Stadi@@ on in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the largest in@@ timi@@ dation in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dynam@@ o is also incomplete after 41 games after the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; campaign launched in the last season . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the stadium was sh@@ aken on Tuesday evening by an earthquake that were measured on the Rich@@ ter@@ sk@@ ala 3.2 .
this year it was 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger is the opinion that Arsen@@ al has drawn from the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and remains driven away from distant hope , with his management the association will lead to his first euro@@ pe@@ an tri@@ umph .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it has never worked at ar@@ sen@@ al .
we were very close in 2006 but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not a dre@@ amer .
friendly Fest : the com@@ edy show that gave us serious lessons on men &apos;s friend@@ ships
the absence of similar represent@@ ations in shows are obvious , especially in terms of how the need for men to open themselves , now even more des@@ per@@ ate than ever before , such as self @-@ mor@@ als among young men on a 15 @-@ year Ho@@ ch prove .
in 2013 it was the primary matter of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and there are three times more common in men than women .
in trying to tackle the problem , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ ein ( CA@@ LM - campaign against a her@@ edit@@ ary life ) 2015 as the Year of the man , with the aim of asking the culture in question , the men are going to seek help if they need it .
friendship is the heart of battle in order to master this challenge .
a recent study with more than 2,000 High @-@ School students with depres@@ si@@ ves sympt@@ om set that when the suff@@ erer had a sufficient percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood &quot; had dou@@ bled its od@@ ds in recovery .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , hal@@ ved a circle of spiritual healthy or the risks of mental problems .
but of course , one must first have friends , so that a friendship can work .
in the age of more social media @-@ led communication , with its focus on substance on substance , the im@@ pedi@@ ability of the response is often more important than a meaningful contact .
our digital life have the need to appear strong , viable and successful to appear , doubles , even if actually domin@@ ates the isolation .
this super@@ ficial success is dominated by that which psych@@ ologist extr@@ insi@@ c values ; money , image , social status , all at costs intr@@ insi@@ c values - our inner lon@@ ging for personal development and friendship that affect our spiritual health a lot more deeply .
and like a vide@@ os@@ piel @-@ invent@@ ors and billi@@ on@@ aire recently said , money really does not really buy .
the beauty of Friends was that these focus was placed on the head .
every character has not been defined by his work but by his personality , which gli@@ des through the interaction as friend .
the humor of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ lers @-@ frequent hu@@ gs , moments in football and the lon@@ ging of Ross to Rachel - all that came out of knowing that men can definitely refer to it , even if they often have with@@ hold , complete their feelings to explore .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an employee of the telephone calls it explained to me : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my list@@ en@@ ant role for people who feel de@@ pressed and confident sel@@ f@@ ed , showed me a difference to me how even the smallest inter@@ action of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us are often not able to talk with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old thing de@@ pl@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I kom@@ mer involved &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has got an enormous effect as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if you talk about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes in mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it presents clearly the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ sider &apos;s status on the phone to help people in moments of desp@@ air may also help , the long term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the giving ceremony to the celebration of the day completely re@@ formed scenery , why do not take your friends to have a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better if you see in Star@@ bu@@ cks anyone alone , give him a smile and say hello .
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent on Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the entire 236 episode - for the Friend@@ ly Fest
di Maria hits to be PSG to cr@@ ushing Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celeb@@ rates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ ui@@ di and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hit to Malm@@ ö .
di Maria goes at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps to Malm@@ ö to Malm@@ ö .
here are the playing field and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held the course , as Paris Saint @-@ Germain , its Champions League season with a extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö launched on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League Deb@@ ts as PSG @-@ player who brought the French master on the way , but afterwards he missed a number of opportunities before they finally achieved their anticip@@ ation more than Cav@@ ani in the 6@@ 1st minute a head@@ ache .
with real Madrid and chess t@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in group A needs a strong start against the Swedish champion as they seek not only the qualification of the K@@ O@@ .-@@ l@@ aps , but an improvement on the path to the quarter @-@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while she got the points , it was no game of Laurent Blan@@ cs Team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovi@@ cs Dis@@ play@@ able opportunities in front of the gate . he became later in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the club , with which he began his illustr@@ ate career already in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 to win our opponents issues and look back at ease even if there are certain things that we have to do in the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we did not yet have one or two more gates . &quot;
I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic returned after his violation in one of three changes to Paris @-@ Team , holding the weekend 2 : 2 Un@@ decided on own place against Bordeaux in the first le@@ ague , but he was engra@@ ved in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argent@@ inian wings was referred to as the man who was eligible for the next stage in Europe when he was in Manchester United in the last month , and he pointed out why , when he ran into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Malm@@ ö @-@ defense before he gradu@@ ated to Johan Wil@@ and past nice into the long corner of the net .
but if anyone believed that they would achieve a great win , which was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö that Celtic on a Play @-@ off proposed in order to reach this level , joined the field at An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national spiel@@ ers on the field and was then cutting with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle of the central field .
but besides a shot of Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tr@@ apps P@@ fo@@ sts in the 3@@ 4th minute , they boot up little in the attack .
instead , PSG itself was sometimes on , with some mis@@ cre@@ ases and bad results , not least from I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic , which was abandoned at no less than five attempts , and abandoned , after Cav@@ ani had appointed him after the rest@@ art .
nevertheless he pointed much more skill , when he brought his fellow @-@ player into the game , and it was a pass of I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic that turned to Di Maria to a rot@@ ary , which was presented by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the P@@ fo@@ sten ...
the second gate fell finally shortly after the hours @-@ mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Cen@@ ay@@ er achieved with it the sixth place of the season , after I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic had picked up a left side of Max@@ well .
this ended all thought that Malm@@ ö could return to the game , and just an excellent input from Wil@@ and from the short@@ est distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , was able to keep the end result , before replacement of E@@ z@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi was detected at the end .
the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ eide , announced that for a class over his team he played and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was in December last year .
since then , we have played only in the Swedish le@@ ague who did not have the same level .
the qualification games are not enough . &quot;
Hu@@ t from Paris !
it was a great game of them !

&apos;@@ American Ninja Warri@@ or &apos; cryp@@ ted first Champion
professional sport clim@@ bers and operator Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero was the first ath@@ l@@ ete , who won the American Ninja Warri@@ or on Monday evening and took the Grand Prix of 1 Million $ with home .
the contest Show , which had just completed their 7th season , had never experienced a competition participants , which could shut all steps of his obstacle @-@ par@@ c@@ ours .
during the season they made two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off B@@ ritten , to the Fin@@ als .
the last task belonged to climbing at a 75 feet long climbing frame in 30 seconds .
B@@ ritten ended the task within time , which he was the first ath@@ l@@ ete which ended the stren@@ uous phase 4 by American Ninja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero ended this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke to E ! messages after the hard win victory , still under shock over the profit of the Grand Prix of 1 million $ .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I have never earned over 10,000 $ or had life &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so quite suddenly .. as I can not even imagine how that is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer of K@@ ent We@@ ed K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Rep@@ or@@ ter to discuss the final final and why B@@ ritten , although he ended first at all the par@@ c@@ ours , not any prize money .
according to the rules , the money goes to the quick@@ est person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than a fin@@ alists , it will be the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and life changed , it receives the great c@@ ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think that he h@@ eds in it .
he is just as fortunate to have done what he has done .
he received the masses of awards from the crowd .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I should be@@ aten from someone , then I am glad that it is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think it would have felt just as they had the roles .
America Ninja Warri@@ or was extended for a term stag@@ el , the fil@@ ming will start in spring 2016 .
Det@@ roit Tig@@ ers p@@ ses to Min@@ nes@@ ota T@@ wins past
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ OL@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not especially funny for the Det@@ roit Tig@@ ers .
once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the tiger is on the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as a Sp@@ o@@ iler , played this part however on Tuesday perfectly against Min@@ nes@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target field .
the T@@ wins waste a chance to climb over a half of the Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card square .
for Det@@ roit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word that was difficult to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all vic@@ tories are fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said tiger Manager Brad be@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Alfre@@ do Simon held its early offensive support , considered Det@@ roit three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth , and then once again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) proposed 6 times on in 1 / 3 inside and made three of us .
it was only his third party in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to quit this year &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is difficult to throw at the Bull@@ pen every game , and therefore I want to go into the game again .
the des@@ ig@@ ni@@ fied Tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three matches and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid August .
it was the first three @-@ hit game of Mart@@ ine@@ z , since then he had four hits against the Seattle nav@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has good dr@@ ill@@ ings well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good off at ( brass training ) , saw distinc@@ tly better out of the bul@@ l@@ pen , and he put it directly into the game .
with three r@@ ents at the back of the seventh day , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back into play .
center F@@ iel@@ der B@@ yr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton ended the inning with a double to the left field line .
Right F@@ iel@@ d@@ Aaron H@@ icks reached a b@@ unt , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ cian to the Stri@@ ke@@ out before he replaced by the Link@@ sh@@ lands Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy was going into the wall , the only man , with whom he was confronted , before des@@ ig@@ ni@@ fied R@@ ookie group Miguel S@@ ano , who is the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w contrac@@ ting a two @-@ run .
with a pair of run@@ ners and the grad@@ uation @-@ run by the second brought contrac@@ ting the third bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play .
it was the major le@@ ague leading in major le@@ ague times in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe was a double play .
after Det@@ roit at the end of the ne@@ below inside , we added a R@@ BI @-@ double against the Cl@@ os@@ er of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the booth of 5 @-@ 4 .
however , the right @-@ handed leave however S@@ ano at three pitches for his fifth file .
Det@@ roit benef@@ ited to the pre@@ lu@@ de of the game by an even not moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the tig@@ ers achieved three r@@ uns in the first two inter@@ ings against the justi@@ fication @-@ veter@@ an who had been canc@@ eled before the game from the vulner@@ ability group , after having been missing one month because of a back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously not the beginning I wished for , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I felt more comfor@@ ting than I was rele@@ asing and felt that I would create some pretty good pitches with the third inning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after she got on the first the Lead@@ off Bat@@ man , H@@ ints gave a single to Second B@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a two @-@ out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to the game , which creates a single &quot; up the Middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed its 0 @-@ 21 track series with the Run@@ ners in the Scor@@ ing Position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed a single on the right , created another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z has been thrown out of the game , as he tried to go to the third , what the threat was ended .
the Tig@@ ers placed in the second to , achieved a ONE @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single of Center @-@ F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose to the 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was one big blow , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he did not very well be@@ aten , but he got the right place .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch Count , sco@@ red no points in the third inning , before it was replaced by the Rel@@ ie@@ ver of A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there came to three hits and a walk with four kn@@ ke@@ outs .
notes : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ chez divided due to a violation of the litter @-@ school .

Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria
the head of the Münch@@ ner Security Conference , Wolfgang Zur@@ inger , considers military action with German participation in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think the deci@@ de@@ dly re @-@ thinking about military action options cannot take place without Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he thre@@ w the European states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago , one was glad that the ch@@ ali@@ ce of military participation in Germany has been going forward .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict happens before our front door , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German Ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase of international humanitarian assistance on site for refugees .
Austria controls the south and eastern borders
further controls are introduced to Germany on its southern and eastern borders .
the Austrian in@@ cu@@ ed Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said on the evening of the Austrian TV @-@ sender OR@@ F , to Hungary there will now be no one back now .
I also sent Germany from Austria to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , this is so agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the question of an agreement , after which Germany could start a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , Mik@@ l Leit@@ ner said , I have already given discussions between the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General@@ ate Security and representatives of Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concrete figures did not call it and pointed to talks on Wednesday in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past few days , ten thousands of refugees had come to Austria on the so @-@ called Bal@@ kan@@ route from Hungary to Austria .
your goal is mostly Germany .
ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann met a special summit for next week together with several other EU leaders .
Germany had started on Sunday with temporary border controls .
the EU states have not yet opened up a joint action in the crisis .
the EU &apos;s interior ministers want to take a new meeting to the binding distribution of more than 120 000 refugees on the coming Tuesday ( 22 September ) .
given the strong wave of refugees in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the initial and distribution of the people .
the Bund defended this in common with the coun@@ ties , announced Merkel in the late utility day after almost four @-@ hour consultations with the Prime Minister at the Office council in Berlin .
Merkel under@@ score , those people , protecting women , Uz@@ be@@ k this too .
who did not have bad perspective , could not remain in Germany too .
this idea was not dealt with in the hand .
the ch@@ anc@@ ellor stressed that the state as a whole was now faced with &quot; huge strength of strength . &quot;
thousands of bitter refugees now have on the bal@@ kan@@ route .
Hungary had closed its 175 kilometres long border with Serbia on the night .
a few hours later , the government announced in Budapest to return the border to Romania with a fence .
this neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary would like to prevent tu@@ g@@ boats in Romania , &quot; said Ungar@@ ns Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government condem@@ ned the plan immediately .
there was first ar@@ rests of men who had en@@ rolled the fence .

Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther &apos;s place
nearly 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther &apos;s place in Rome .
in the presence of Stadt@@ prä@@ sident Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino was bapti@@ zed on Wednesday a quite nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill on the name of the German Reform@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will now be hon@@ oured as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park lies in the middle of the old Rome just beside the Col@@ osse@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was applied by the Coll@@ abor@@ ation of the evangel@@ ical Ch@@ urches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , Re@@ ver@@ er of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome , rec@@ alled the Wednesday that the Protest@@ ants were able to live in the city of the Pop@@ es over centuries as a minority often only in the secret of their faith .
with the place I become visible in a symbolic way that their tradition of Christian faith is in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was seen as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k for the annual sol@@ sti@@ ce 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he received the city then as a comm@@ iss@@ ful sin@@ ner .
his negative impressions are likely to be supported by histori@@ ans in his later struggle against Rome .
Luther had then initiated with his th@@ eses against the distr@@ action of the s@@ end@@ s@@ domestic church .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gil@@ ded ) Dorn@@ enk@@ rone is one of the main works of the Ot@@ mar Alt for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which now has now been published with gorgeous paintings .
in the beginning it was the picture of Ot@@ mar Alt who formulated his very personal inter@@ pret@@ ations of bibli@@ cal stories on paper and canvas .
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but by no means also syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; images .
on the contrary , the respective topics is adapted , it can quite be quite dark .
&quot; &quot; &quot; approximately three years Ot@@ mar participated in his Bible project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for which he made a subjective artistic selection from the many them@@ atic areas of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; book of all books &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these cycles are cy@@ ber , who de@@ vote themselves issues such as cr@@ us@@ ade , pl@@ agues , bi@@ ds , or fa@@ ther@@ land .
thus , he int@@ ends to fascin@@ ate several partners : this applies to the Luther &apos;s publisher with its the@@ ological orientation just as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with his focus on art books .
and since above all , the author Klaus El@@ ep@@ r@@ ust , who is now faced with the respective Bible issues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he interpreted the Bible chosen by Ot@@ mar Alt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and so as to the today , into current contex@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like ver@@ bal mirror of painting painting .
between the original Bi@@ bel@@ it@@ at of Martin Luther , and each of the artist , they are each of the artist who formulated his very personal thoughts for each situation .
the jewelry band has golden letters .
thus the 75 @-@ year @-@ old has twice a profound insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high level of intimacy .
emotions were ultimately born at all the trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , 1940 in Wern@@ ig@@ ero@@ de born and raised in Berlin , comes from a family who belonged to the strict prot@@ est@@ ant Herr@@ n@@ h@@ uter @-@ Or@@ den .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there the education already happened to the Rohr@@ stock , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remin@@ ds Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tried to process that to wear myself also with the Lord Father too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to help the art in quick@@ life time again : &quot; the perception of cap@@ es is shaped today by complaints , and that &apos;s noisy .
symbol@@ ism is presented there .
artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things .
images are always something mysti@@ cal and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants to allow the viewer to look into the pictures &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; come down on themselves , discover and feel the power they have : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the image is looking for itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus An@@ ep@@ r@@ st was held on Tuesday at the presentation of Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; always like &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Art : &quot; I like , how he lives with his pictures . &quot;
he did not consider the Bible fully to grasp the Bible but that for him important , also mysterious subjects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was not a collaboration on eye @-@ level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here it is about the images , the text explains only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be written &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from Luther &apos;s publisher is this work an invitation to deep@@ en his life and to find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pictures speak for mothers of both the ( bibli@@ cal ) language of love as well as responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - Paper and P@@ ads - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition which is opened on November 15th in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung .
construction of the construction for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year has never happened this year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it can then be started without &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further commemor@@ ative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the works at the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fied commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B expands its commitment to refugees from 2003 to 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga begins a clear sign on the weekend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the football is responding to the situation in Germany and sec@@ ures politics his help in cop@@ ing with the upcoming problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I consider the biggest challenge of our country since the re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there can no one be said in the principle , it doesn &apos;t matter , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be interested in get a grip on this subject , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B @-@ Chef Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on September 23 in Berlin , he int@@ ends to discuss the refuge@@ e situation in Germany intensi@@ vely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am next Wednesday at the office office and meet there the Minister of State of Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the ch@@ anc@@ ellor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here the topic will surely play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; announced he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the football can and wants to help .
but the decisive step has to set the policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Bundes@@ liga has therefore expanded its refuge@@ e initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; through the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us Braun Stiftung we ensured that this program runs until 2019 , &quot; stated Ni@@ ers@@ bach at the edge of the U@@ EFA @-@ Meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
also some Bundes@@ liga team support this program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already this weekend , the 36 Prof@@ iles set a clear sign when it comes to the left Tri@@ k@@ ot@@ är@@ mel , otherwise of the usual sponsor@@ ship logos ( her@@ mes ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can only , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bol@@ di Fi@@ fth of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Zeitung ( Tuesday ) and symb@@ oli@@ zing the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refuge@@ e drama is falling every one cannot see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we may have football @-@ Bundes@@ liga , no , we must use our radi@@ ance , our influence and our ways to help the many refugees who have been so incredible as to help , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz .
Hoff@@ en@@ hei@@ ms Director Peter Back spoke of a &quot; prominent signs of the League . &quot;
for the EM @-@ qualification race against Hungary on this Friday the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach visited the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a big joint project in German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 license lists in their own projects have been great , be great .
well , it is just as great that small and smallest associations are active .
the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; we spent , will live in football .
&quot; it is of enormous significance , &quot; he said .
this and the next year the association will jointly provide 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees with the DF@@ B selection and the German Federal Government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the betra@@ y@@ al have already called the whole sum for 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; told Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP ball@@ head@@ ers loses an eye for an accident
the prem@@ acy of the greatest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has got lost many reports by a crash in early July .
at the accident on the stair@@ way in the house of his Bro@@ ther in the USA he dropped after midnight on a water@@ glass which he held in the left hand , report the &quot; Economic week &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is almost blood @-@ driven , he was power@@ less , then pushed out from the road - this he tells us so last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ Where &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SAP @-@ co @-@ founder H@@ asso &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could go after his work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beginning of October we meet in front of the Supervisory Board in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said plat@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 54 year old managers were at the meeting and &quot; fully un@@ employed . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thurs@@ days ) in October and continue to visit Germany in October .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am full for SAP , full of my job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course I got the whole time in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its Chairman H@@ asso Platt@@ ner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t comm@@ its usually between Germany and the US , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal story , said the manager of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SZ &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important is to stand up again if you like . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ replacement pilot Magn@@ um except sk@@ ir@@ m@@ ish ...
Magn@@ ill@@ t@@ wit@@ ter@@ te a corresponding photo and explained , he lost the injury then he was cr@@ ashed by the wheel .
he therefore comes as little as a reserve for the two leaders of Fernando Al@@ onso and J@@ ens@@ on Button , like a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan .
football : Bv@@ B without Re@@ us against Krasno@@ dar : past@@ ure in the gate
in Bor@@ ussia Dortmund have made all hopes for a com@@ eb@@ ack by Marco Re@@ us in the first group game of the Europa League .
the National player is missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga as well as in the Du@@ el with the F@@ K Krasno@@ dar am Thursday ( 7 : 00 / sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot rely on him unfortunately , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ spiel to Leverkusen , leaving the BV@@ B Coach open : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
given the high load of its pro@@ s , Tu@@ chel turns his gene@@ alog@@ f not only on the Re@@ us position .
he announced a change on the door @-@ position .
therefore novel Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes place the place of tri@@ b@@ art@@ enders Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; he exercises at an absolute top @-@ level , &quot; pra@@ ised the Soccer teacher the World Master .
whether the wh@@ ites in the future comes into all Europe @-@ League games to be used , Tu@@ chel left however open .
with a high degree of probability he will also be the second game .
the for@@ ged statement of fellow players Re@@ us that the Fin@@ alist will be the target for BV@@ B in the Europe League that holds mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian W@@ eig@@ l for veri@@ fiable : &quot; in this way Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
&quot; I think we have a good chance to access the title . &quot;
robot cars : government wants to take a pioneer in Germany
in Germany after the will of the German federal government , Germany shall be on the change of the cars &apos; technological pione@@ ers .
the Bundes@@ kab@@ in@@ ett decided on Wednesday a Strateg@@ ic paper in the Haus of Verkehr@@ sm@@ ini@@ ster Alexander Dobr@@ in@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) which provides investments among other investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dobr@@ in@@ dt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt at the edge of the Autom@@ esse I@@ AA by a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new mobile homes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the automated and connected driving shall increase the traffic safety and ensure less pun@@ ches , &quot; Dobr@@ in@@ dt .
he wants to discuss the subject with his counter@@ part from the G@@ 7 states , who also gather together with representatives from the industry .
the Strateg@@ ic Department of Transport ministry st@@ resses among other things the importance of mobile broad@@ band set @-@ up and a high level of digital radio radio .
the testing of new technology is currently being created on highway 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so that the driver will not be extended to additional terms of liability , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the federal government wants to check the legal framework &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and where necessary to adapt to new developments &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , Germany wants to employ around internationally for ensuring that the permitted maximum speed for self @-@ driving cars stopped at 10 to 130 km / hour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the federal government wants to stand up for a change to the Vienna Convention which so far only man sees itself as a driver . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with automated driving takes over at increasing the car the tour , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data within seconds .
after a study by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , a highly automated driving will be technically possible on motor@@ ways until 2020 .
nevertheless , vehicles can be expected on public roads &quot; first far from 2020 . &quot;
value creation in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions in Germany assess the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to around 8,@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital connectivity of the P@@ k@@ ws can lead to more safety and efficiency in road transport , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the SPD &apos;s announ@@ cements of Bart@@ ol . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the question of liability in accidents and the security of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clari@@ fied .
yet the German self @-@ driving cars are skep@@ tical - much more than Fr@@ ench@@ men or Americans .
one on Wednesday at the AA presented survey of the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the EU@@ S@@ gan@@ isation DE@@ K@@ RA come to the outcome that only eight percent of the Germans believe that 32 percent are expected to prev@@ ail over the next ten years , 32 percent do not expect it at all in this .
in France 21 percent of those sur@@ vey@@ ed up to 20@@ 25 with autonom@@ ous vehicles , in the USA 33 percent .
anyway , the drivers in Germany are not yet ready to go completely on a self @-@ run vehicle .
according to a collection of digital inputs Bit@@ kom , only seven percent will be able to agree to the control during the entire trip on all roads .
on the highway , the traffic can be present in flowing traffic up to 15 percent , in the St@@ au 45 percent .
good every fourth would not leave the car under any circumstances .
B@@ oll speaks teamwork and double start at table tennis @-@ EM
the Düssel@@ dorfer wants to present the current state at the title of the title of September 25 to October 4 only in the single .
the final decision is to be handed down at the latest on September 22 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the guys have experienced it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to pick up the title even without Timo the title , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said German rainer Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the EM @-@ appren@@ tic@@ eship in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
b@@ oll at this point was on the flight to a long @-@ term agreed @-@ rate unit in China at this time .
the 34 years old German champion will be returned on Friday .
&quot; without Timo is the disadvantage , we are now no longer as a clear favorite , &quot; explained single @-@ Europ@@ am@@ eister Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov .
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who runs the S@@ etz@@ liste in J@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , however , rec@@ alled to the EM 2013 in Sch@@ iller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back then Timo was missing , and we have become Europ@@ am@@ eister &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this we should orient@@ ate ourselves , &quot; explained the world @-@ rank @-@ fifth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the English so@@ ccer player Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United has had a serious injury on the right leg .

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an En@@ f@@ ant H@@ enny
it is a mix of very great Mo@@ den@@ schau and a guard panel : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) exhibited an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : display man@@ nequins , which look sc@@ ary thanks to Video@@ proj@@ ections .
they contribute to the spectacular creations of the French design , which was among other things with Mad@@ onn@@ as Stage out@@ fits to the great star of the Mo@@ des@@ scene - and thus that he put men in to@@ cks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot say today that I am the En@@ f@@ ant H@@ enny of Haute Cou@@ ture , because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier it was bre@@ ached , now it is real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gau@@ l@@ tier &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for visitors to the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk &quot; ( V@@ om Bürger@@ stei@@ g auf den Lauf@@ ste@@ g ) , who is seen from 18 September at the Kuns@@ thalle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kulturstiftung , it is a happiness that the fashion pot@@ ter has changed his beginning to a show about his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he had been against it , because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me an exhibition seemed to be a bit of death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , one gets to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously made in Canadian Montreal and in Paris .
&quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just lovely clothes , &quot; said the director of the Kuns@@ thalle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren .
it is about tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the man &apos;s inst@@ ant@@ aneous work of man , which has written the fashion history without ever having an education .
chron@@ ologically , the Sch@@ au is not structured but it is a perfectly chore@@ ograph@@ ed overall artwork that was run for much effort : to fr@@ ize the doll@@ s , for example is a sty@@ list dedicated .
14 tons of material have sco@@ red the makers according to the indications of the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot in Munich .
just before the start of the Oktober@@ fest was a special sh@@ ear @-@ out : a le@@ ather@@ proof @-@ fit with cor@@ set .
Heidi meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is always interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ ti@@ ers alter Ted@@ dy is shown in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , z@@ ag@@ ath@@ our@@ y obe@@ di@@ ence of the design .
as a child ( he was not a good student and po@@ or@@ ly in football ) he was attracted by his Ted@@ dy B@@ HS and d@@ resses , Gau@@ l@@ tier said .
to play with a pupp@@ et , his parents had not allowed him .
the de@@ formation of fashion he brought himself later to himself .
he made his fashi@@ oned magazines and saw the dra@@ fts of other designers , such as Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich told .
later I bought it out of course .
for his first own fashion show he cannot pay the mod@@ el .
they were told nothing , but they were able to keep the clothes ...
jewellery instead of Gar@@ dine - Pl@@ au@@ ener tip as mode @-@ niche
earlier it went to the long nit@@ rogen machines in and around Pl@@ auen to make meter .
the embro@@ i@@ dered substances and points were produced in large quantities for customers , for example , for example on blank@@ ets and curtains .
this alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the Mo@@ vers@@ ary Pl@@ auen .
instead , the fashion is back important .
in the initial times of the Pl@@ au@@ ener summit played fashion a bigger role , then pushed back by the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : top in jewelry , accessories such as hand@@ bags and in regional trays .
at all the so @-@ called Vintage @-@ fashion , who worship himself from past styl@@ istic eras , a growing order potential .
wh@@ o@@ ever served in the textile industry in Germany is no longer held on the market .
with us they already take half of all orders .
Mo@@ ez@@ est Pl@@ auen is co @-@ affiliated with nine further companies member of the Industry Association of Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze and embro@@ ider@@ ies .
only they can bear the protected label .
in the last 15 years approximately 80 percent of the revenues were canc@@ eled .
private experts and also the wholes@@ aler , there are almost no more .
our products are hardly available to customers in this path .
mass produc@@ ts@@ i will be manufactured much cheaper in the Asian region and distributed almost exclusively on chains .
in addition , the export , up to Russia and the US .
enough reasons for new ways .
the industry @-@ association also tries thanks to environmental awareness , such as Cord@@ ula Bauer by the embro@@ ider@@ y in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; this year we have a quality seal , which shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially responsible . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt complet@@ es : &quot; this refers to the materials used . &quot;
Ute and Ute , Ute Schmidt was te@@ aches at the Schne@@ eberger International University of Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and is specialized in embro@@ ider@@ ies and points .
in order to continue the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and the factories , which must think above all economically viable , &quot; says Schmidt .
therefore , a existing design will often only be slightly varies in order to keep a customer base .
a few years ago , textile techni@@ cian cat@@ i re@@ lies the historical snow @-@ tip new .
in doing this the machine wal@@ low@@ ed to some places small ch@@ icks .
the Pl@@ au@@ ener Gold@@ schmi@@ e@@ ders made himself inspire them : &quot; before , I was not able to begin with traditional Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze . &quot;
now they use the snow @-@ tip for your jewelry .
in an elaborate processes , they shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people of the region identify with the theme of Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; says Re@@ uter .
they also supplies to the US , to Australia and to Finland - especially to our customers whose ancestors lived in ch@@ ew@@ eb@@ rows and surroundings and who want to be a reminder .
so I see my jewelry as the modern amb@@ assador of the pl@@ au@@ ener tip .

the government will also manage controls to the powers transferred to the company and make sure that companies decide how they perform their business .

however , large car@@ ni@@ fic @-@ fish are already so strongly charged with mer@@ cury that are not to be sold on the basis of the existing thres@@ hold values , about 50 percent of the case .
after dou@@ bling of the thres@@ hold values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be reduced .
in return for this lo@@ os@@ ening , the EU wants to shar@@ pen the limit values for other subjects of currently 0.5 milli@@ gram to 0.1 milli@@ gram mer@@ cury per kil@@ ogra@@ m .
Food@@ watch was referred to as &quot; trick &quot; because smaller gra@@ vey@@ or fish , such as car@@ p are usually so low charged to keep their planned high@@ s already today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ab@@ dic@@ ation at Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one per@@ fi@@ des distr@@ action , that helps the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explained Wolf@@ schmi@@ dt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mercury is a highly tox@@ ic sword , which strongly enrich@@ es itself to the food chain in particular in rob@@ ber@@ fish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the federal government therefore war@@ ns us that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already small amounts of especially un@@ born sh@@ red@@ ness of the nervous system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Ministry of Finance is explained on his homepage with regard to the applicable values , but that a &quot; health haz@@ ards of the general population &quot; could not be expected .
Mercury is largely obtained through the cohesion into the environment .
according to a written information provided by the German Federal Ministry of Finance , the German Bundestag , Ann@@ alena Ba@@ er@@ bock has received more than six tonnes of Mercury in the year , two thirds of the total volume .
the concentration of mer@@ cury in fish some in the Elbe , Rhine and Danube is &quot; permanent and super@@ ficial @-@ deck@@ end , &quot; the &quot; mirror &quot; had c@@ ited from the paper in March .
last year @-@ wide war@@ nings from mer@@ cury in fish already made up to the most common health risks in the EU @-@ War@@ n@@ system RA@@ S@@ FF .
