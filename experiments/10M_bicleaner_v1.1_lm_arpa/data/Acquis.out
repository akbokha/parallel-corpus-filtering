reag@@ ents to blood @-@ group determination are to distribute in such manner and in such quantities not only to carry out tests with unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the amount referred in in a container must be so big that the content may be used in this protocol described in this protocol .
the manufacturer Labs has over all production levels and controls of reag@@ ents to blood @-@ group@@ ing written records .
appropriate samples of all re@@ reag@@ ents are kept so long from the laboratory in order to store up until with some probability , the batch can no longer be used .
the reag@@ ents used for blood @-@ determination can contain substances of human , animal , vegetable ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective piece of aid to rein@@ forcement effectiveness and maintaining the stability of realis@@ es .
for technical reasons , this reag@@ ents are divided according to the origin of its effective part in three groups .
this means not that the reag@@ ents of human origin contain only substances of human origin or that animal or herbal reag@@ ents contain any substances of human origin .
on each individual container is a black on white printed label in English and French language which contains the following information : 1st name and address of the manufacturer ,
4. the amount or , at dried reag@@ ents , the amount and composition of the liquid necessary fluid ,

some &quot; in@@ complete &quot; Ser@@ a ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ate on objects also hom@@ olog@@ ous red blood cells which are recorded in their own serum or plasma .
the following requirements for the effectiveness of Ser@@ a to the determination of the R@@ h group may possibly change if international standard samples are provided . ( i ) Anti @-@ D ( anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) blood @-@ group@@ ing ( human )
anti @-@ D serum is obtained from the blood of one or several people , which are immune to the an@@ tigen D of the R@@ h @-@ Systems .
it re@@ acts with human red blood cells which contain an@@ tigen D but not with human red blood cells that contain an@@ tigen D .
&quot; complete anti @-@ D Ser@@ a must have a tit@@ er of at least 1 : 32 compared to C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells in a 0.@@ 9@@ percent liquid solution .
a &quot; in@@ complete &quot; anti @-@ D serum is parallel to the again dissolved , but un@@ diluted international standard @-@ par@@ ate of the in@@ complete anti @-@ D ( anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) or a corresponding comparison of C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells to fil@@ tering .
in addition to a reaction with all red blood cells that contain an@@ tigen , the serum is to react , according to the possibility of blood cells , the do @-@ an@@ tigen contain .
anti @-@ D Ser@@ a , which are dest@@ ined for use of objects according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , must have mixed ag@@ glut@@ ination of approximately 40 Â° C within 30 seconds , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds .
anti @-@ C serum is obtained from the blood of one or several people , which are immune to the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ firm@@ ity of the R@@ h @-@ Systems .
it re@@ acts with floo@@ ding human blood cells which contain the an@@ tigen C , but not with human red blood cells that contain the C @-@ an@@ tigen .
these Ser@@ a are therefore specifically tail@@ ored for the C @-@ an@@ tigen , if the tested blood cells in a 0.@@ 9@@ percent cooking solution .
the tit@@ er of the anti @-@ C Ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; complete &quot; ) must be at least 1 : 8 compared to C@@ c@@ d@@ de@@ e blood cells .
anti @-@ C Ser@@ a , which are intended for use in sheets according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son ( and no form of anti @-@ D ) , must have mixed ag@@ glut@@ ination of approximately 40 Â° C within 30 seconds , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds .
anti @-@ E serum is obtained from the blood of one or several people , which are immune to the an@@ tigen E of the R@@ h system .
anti @-@ E Ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; complete &quot; ) should have a tit@@ re of at least 1 : 8 compared to C@@ c@@ dd@@ b blood cells .
anti @-@ E Ser@@ a which are intended for use in sheets according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son ( and not contained in any form of anti @-@ D ) , if they have mixed a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination of approximately 40 Â° C within 30 seconds , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be completed within 120 seconds .
sera of the speci@@ fic@@ ity Anti @-@ D + -@@ c and the speci@@ fic@@ ity of anti @-@ D + e can be produced immediately from the blood of immun@@ ised persons or can be produced by mixing of anti @-@ D with anti @-@ C or anti @-@ E serum .
in a given serum , both antibodies must be effective by the manufacturer specified response conditions at the same time .
if a serum is intended for use in sheets according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation time in all types of red blood cells , which show a reaction , not inf@@ erior to the ant@@ eil@@ igen antibodies .
anti @-@ A serum is obtained from the blood of animals that can be immune to blood cells or specific substances of group A .
anti @-@ A serum gluten @-@ glut@@ in@@ ates human red blood cells , which means that those of blood groups A and AB including the sub @-@ groups A1 , A2 , A@@ 1B and A@@ 2B ; there are no human red blood cells that contain no A an@@ tigen that means those of the blood groups 0 and B .
an anti @-@ A serum is to be recovered in parallel , but un@@ diluted international standard drug of anti @-@ A blood @-@ group@@ ed or a corresponding figure , separated with floo@@ ding of A1 , A2 and A@@ 2B red blood cells ( 1 ) .
anti @-@ A Serum is mixed on an object carrier with same amount of 5 to 10 percent floo@@ ding within the double period , which is necessary , if the same attempt does not occur in the double time , but un@@ diluted international standard drug of anti @-@ A blood @-@ group@@ ed or a standard drug equal to the same Avi@@ o .
anti @-@ B Serum is obtained from the blood of animals which can be immune to red blood cells or specific substances of the blood group B immun@@ ised .
anti @-@ B Serum or human red blood cells that contain B @-@ an@@ tigen that means those of blood groups B and AB ; there is no human red blood cells that contain no B an@@ tigen that means those of blood groups 0 and A .
an anti @-@ B serum is to be recovered in parallel , but un@@ diluted international standard drug of the anti @-@ B blood group or a corresponding comparison , with a floo@@ ding of the group B group B ( 1 ) .
anti @-@ B Serum is mixed on an object carrier with same amount of 5 to 10 percent floo@@ ding of B blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double time , but if the same attempt was carried out with the non @-@ sol@@ uble , but un@@ diluted international standard drug of the anti @-@ B blood group or with a standard drug equal at the same time .
anti @-@ human glob@@ ulin serum to use in hem@@ oph@@ en@@ ology must contain ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating antibodies against Ig@@ G glob@@ ulin and ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating antibodies .
it is extracted from the blood of animals , which are immune to in@@ injection of human serum .
