A@@ bil@@ i@@ fy is used to treat more serious and severe lack of episodes and pre@@ vent@@ ative episodes on patients who have applied to the drug in the past .
injection solution is applied for fast control of distur@@ b@@ ance or behavi@@ our@@ al problems if the oral dosage of the medication is not possible .
both diseases can take the solution to insert or processed processed tablets of patients who prepare the swal@@ low of tablets difficulty .
in patients who use other drugs , the same as A@@ bil@@ i@@ fy , should be adapted to the use of A@@ bil@@ i@@ fy .
this imp@@ airs signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable communication of ner@@ ve cells to each other .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol works mainly as &quot; partial ag@@ itation &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ itter d@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amine ( also called ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amine and d@@ op@@ amine , but in lower dimensions as the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ itter are being able to activate the recept@@ ors .
da D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amine in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia and bi@@ polar distur@@ b@@ ance play a role , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol contributes to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , causing psych@@ otic or man@@ ical symptoms , and its re@@ act will be prevented .
the efficacy of A@@ bil@@ i@@ fy , repe@@ ating the symptoms , was examined in three studies above up to one year .
the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared to 8@@ 05 patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia or similar conditions that had suffered severe nau@@ sea , compared to a period of two hours with a placebo .
in another study , A@@ bil@@ i@@ fy was carried out over twelve weeks of 347 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l , in another study carried out efficacy of A@@ bil@@ i@@ fy and placebo that were stabil@@ ized at 160 patients with which the man@@ ian symptoms had already been stabil@@ ized with A@@ bil@@ i@@ fy .
the effectiveness of the A@@ bil@@ i@@ fy injection solution was compared to 301 patients with bi@@ polar distur@@ b@@ ance that had suffered severe nau@@ gh@@ ness , compared to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti @-@ psychological ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies the change of symptoms of patients were examined using a standard sc@@ ala for bi@@ polar distur@@ b@@ ance or the number of patients who spoke to treatment .
the company also resulted studies of studies to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the melting tablet and the solution to take res@@ or@@ ate ( decreases ) .
in the two studies with the injection of injection , patients who received A@@ bil@@ i@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9,@@ 75 mg or 15 mg received significantly more severe reduction in symptoms of un@@ rest distur@@ b@@ ance than the patients who received placebo .
in the application for the treatment of bi@@ polar interference A@@ bil@@ i@@ fy in four of five short @-@ time studies of man@@ ical symptoms were more effective than placebo .
in addition , A@@ bil@@ i@@ fy prevented for up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo the re @-@ acting episodes of previously treated patients and when an existing treatment was administered .
A@@ bil@@ i@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 mg doses were also more effective than placebo in the symptoms and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common adverse events of A@@ bil@@ i@@ fy to take ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) , Ak@@ ath@@ isie ( constant movement ) , dis@@ sem@@ ination , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , ob@@ sol@@ ini secre@@ tion ( increased memory production ) , ti@@ ci@@ bly secre@@ tion ( increased memory production ) , ti@@ red@@ ness and exhau@@ st@@ ion , o@@ dd@@ ity , in@@ som@@ nie ( sleeping disorders ) and anxi@@ ety ( sleep disorders ) and anxi@@ ety .
at the conclusion that the benefits of A@@ bil@@ i@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia and from moderate to severe lack of episodes in patients who had mainly man@@ ical episodes and during which the lack of episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol spoke about the risks .
in addition , the committee came to the result that the advantages of injection processes during fast control of distur@@ b@@ ance and behavi@@ our@@ al problems in patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia or in patients with lack of episodes at bi@@ polar @-@ I disorders , if a oral therapy is not suitable , compared to the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission granted the Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. for placing the placing of A@@ bil@@ i@@ fy in the entire European Union .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is indicated for the treatment of regular multiple episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I@@ - disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had mainly man@@ ical episodes and their lack of episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day , regardless of meals .
an increased effectiveness in doses above a daily dose of 15 mg was not detected , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mono@@ therap@@ ies or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I@@ - disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
with resi@@ due to the larger sensitivity of this group of patients a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors are justi@@ fy this ( see section 4.4 ) .
if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induction ector from combination therapy is used , the Ari@@ pi@@ zi@@ z@@ ol dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the occurr@@ ence of su@@ ici@@ dal behaviour belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ecting disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changing an anti@@ mental therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( see section 4.8 ) .
results of an ep@@ ide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that patients with bi@@ polar distur@@ b@@ ance risk is not an increased su@@ ici@@ dal risk with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ica .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol should be applied with care of patients with known cardiovascular disease ( my@@ oc@@ ardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic disease , conditions that pre@@ vent@@ ative disorders ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , h@@ yp@@ ov@@ ol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure sensitive medicines ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and mal@@ ign@@ ant shape ) .

when using AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y patients showed signs and symptoms of a late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis , should be taken into consideration to reduce the dose or to break the treatment .
when a patient signs and symptoms developed on a m@@ ns , or a clear fever without any additional clinical manifest@@ ation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ica must be removed including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
therefore Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in patients with cl@@ amp@@ er waste should be used in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese or in states that are related to c@@ amp@@ er accidents in connection with caution .

there was however in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the response to un@@ wanted cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol treated patients .
hyper@@ glyc@@ emia in some cases are extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ azi@@ de or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients who were treated with atyp@@ ical anti@@ mental agents including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
there are no precise risk assessment for hyper@@ glyc@@ emia @-@ related events with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic active substances treated patients who allow direct compare .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ia , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly with respect to glucose levels .
a weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ ens patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ie due to com@@ modities , the application of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ica , with which weight gain as a side effect , could lead to severe complic@@ ations and could lead to serious complic@@ ations .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol on the central nerv@@ ous system , be careful when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in combination with alcohol or other central @-@ effective medicines are taken with over@@ ply side effects such as Se@@ aling ( see Section 4.8 ) .
the H2 @-@ ant@@ agon@@ ist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ ine , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , but this effect is not relevant as clin@@ ically ir@@ relevant .
in a clinical study of healthy volunteers , a highly effective CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Chin@@ id@@ in ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol by 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 , like flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , similar effects and therefore should be made similar dos@@ is@@ induc@@ tions .
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; ( = &quot; Po@@ or &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ ition@@ ers can lead the joint application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher Plasma concentration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol when compared to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 extensive met@@ abolic specialists .
if you consider the common administration of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol or other highly effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , the potential benefits of potential risks in the patient should consider .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol and HIV prot@@ ectors , could have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dos@@ is@@ induc@@ tions .
after depos@@ iting the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be increased to the dose altitude before the start of the companion .
di@@ lat@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 together with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y can be administered together with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , can be anticipated with a defined increase in Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ol@@ ini concentration .
in clinical studies show doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol per day did not have any significant effect on the met@@ abolic type of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ method@@ x@@ ym@@ orph@@ an ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( war@@ far@@ ine ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( Om@@ ep@@ raz@@ ol ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) .
patients should be advised to inform their doctor if they are pregnant or a pregnancy during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
due to the in@@ sufficient data subject to safety during human beings and due to re@@ productive studies at the beast may not be applied in the pregnancy , unless the possible value justi@@ fies the potential risk for mo@@ ck@@ us .
however , in other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ica the patients should be war@@ ned against it , dangerous machines , including power vehicles , until they are sure that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol has no negative impact on them .
the following adverse events appeared more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medical relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency below must be defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study about 52 weeks occurred in patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including parking ins@@ on@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ ony and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis , compared to patients who were treated with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l ( 5@@ 7.3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled long term study about 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ on@@ z@@ ol treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients were placebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study about 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % were treated in patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ on@@ z@@ ole , and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under o@@ cl@@ adding therapy .

in another study about 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ on@@ z@@ ol treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment .
in the long @-@ term trial period over 26 weeks in a placebo controlled study the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % was treated for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ on@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for placebo @-@ treated patients .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol and placebo in which potentially clinical changes of the rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters were found , y@@ ielded no medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases of CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine @-@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and common , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with placebo patients compared to 2.0 % of the patients treated with placebo .
among the events that may occur in connection with anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , the mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ surgery syndrome , Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis and cr@@ amp@@ fan@@ cases , un@@ wanted cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events and increased mortality with older Dem@@ entia patients , hyper@@ glyc@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in clinical studies and since the market launch were un@@ inten@@ tional or deliber@@ ately acute over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without ob@@ itu@@ aries .
there are no information about the efficacy of a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dosage with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ; it is un@@ likely that Hä@@ ck@@ aly@@ sis has an over@@ dosage of benefits since Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has a high plasma integration .
it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ interference via the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and Ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and a ant@@ agon@@ ist effect on ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed a high aff@@ inity to the D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 receptor as well as a fresh aff@@ inity to the D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 4- , to the Ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7 , for alpha @-@ 1 @-@ ad@@ r@@ gen and for hist@@ amine @-@ H1@@ receptor .
the results of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in dos@@ ages from 0.5 to 30 mg once daily showed a dos@@ is@@ dependent reduction in the engagement of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 recept@@ ors , on Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and on the tur@@ f .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1.@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ ine patients with positive or negative symptoms showed a statistically significant improvement of psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ l @-@ controlled study , 52 percent of the response in response to study medication took part in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l 73 % ) .
current values of measured values defined as secondary Studi@@ ed , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ gom@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - Dep@@ th Rate scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than in Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study about 26 weeks of stabil@@ ized patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia showed a significantly higher reduction in response rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ geon group and 57 % below placebo .
in an oil @-@ controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 314 patients and in which the primary study trip &apos; weight gain &apos; was significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) at an average weight of approximately 5.6 kg .
in two placebo @-@ controlled mono@@ otherapy studies with more flexible dosing for 3 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed an adverse effectiveness in reducing the reduction in reduction of more than 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mono@@ otherapy study about 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ian or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ interference , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo .
in two placebo and actively controlled Mon@@ otherapy studies in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I @-@ interference , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol displayed a comparison of placebo in week 3 and a lasting effect , which was comparable to lithium or semi @-@ eri@@ do@@ l in week 12 .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol also demonstrated a comparable share of patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic remission of the man@@ e on how lithium or semi @-@ eri@@ do@@ l .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study about 6 weeks of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed characteristics of a bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ interference , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol found an over@@ le@@ gen@@ ic effectiveness in reducing the reduction in reducing symptoms compared to mono@@ therap@@ ist with lithium or Val@@ pro@@ at .
10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study about 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ time enlargement phase over 74 weeks for man@@ ic patients who had achieved remission in front of placebo during a stabil@@ ising from placebo in comparison to the prevention of a bi@@ polar retreat , mainly with the prevention of a bi@@ polar back@@ bone .
based on in vitro studies the enz@@ ym@@ es CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the el@@ ong@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ lic of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , the N @-@ De@@ alk@@ yl@@ ation is separated by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 cataly@@ tic .
the mean Eli@@ min@@ ation period is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol for extensive met@@ abolic agents on CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and approximately 146 hours at &apos; poor &apos; ( = &quot; Po@@ or &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ izing over CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics between male and female healthy volunteers , as well as showed a pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ical investigation of schi@@ z@@ op@@ hren@@ ic patients no gender @-@ dependent effects .
a pop @-@ specific evaluation in pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics revealed no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences in ethnic origin or the impact of smoking at pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ical properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol and el@@ ong@@ o Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol were similar in patients with severe kidney failure in comparison to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study involving subjects with different common liver cir@@ rh@@ osis ( Child @-@ P@@ ug@@ h Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol and el@@ ong@@ o Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis of the class C , which is not sufficient to pull sl@@ ums on their met@@ abolic capacity .
based on conventional studies on security har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity at repeated treatment , reproduction tox@@ icity , tox@@ icity and to can@@ o@@ gens , the pre@@ clinical data could not recognize any special haz@@ ards for human beings .
tox@@ ic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only during dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions that exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans , so they have only limited or no significance for clinical use .

in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 291 patients with bi@@ polar distur@@ b@@ ance and ag@@ gression disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ z@@ ol In@@ jection solution was associated with a statistically significant improvement in symptoms as regards to placebo and similar to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - Reference arm .
the mean mean improvement of the initial value at the P@@ AN@@ SS exc@@ itement Component scores with primary 2 @-@ hour end@@ point was 5.8 for placebo , 9,6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8,7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe ag@@ iti@@ vity , a similar efficacy regarding the overall population was observed , but a statistical significance could be determined because of a reduced patient number .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1.@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ ens patients with positive or negative symptoms showed a statistically significant improvement of psych@@ otic symptoms in comparison to placebo .

the efficacy of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a study study , which took part in the 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters had previously received a anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole gift ) was compared to a conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el of the pharmaceutical ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
in total , 72 ( 31 % ) of the 229 were treated with Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane @-@ treated patients to the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients receiving conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drugs .
considering only the patients who were treated for the first time in metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference in relation to the efficacy of disease and survival in relation between drugs .
against it , in people who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer , in terms of these indicators that Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane was more effective as conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medicine .
it may also be used to treat patients who have low neut@@ rop@@ hob@@ ic numbers in the blood before the beginning of the treatment .
the Committee on Human Medic@@ ines ( CH@@ MP ) asser@@ ted that ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane was included in patients with which the first treatment was no longer necessary , effective as conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drugs , and that unlike other P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drugs , it must not be given to other drugs to reduce effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission granted the Ab@@ ra@@ xis Bi@@ os@@ ci@@ ence Limited approval for placing the placing of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union .
Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients where the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease is missing and not indicated for a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine contained therapy ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie ( Neut@@ rop@@ hil@@ en@@ code &lt; 0.50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sens@@ ory Neurop@@ ath@@ y should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in the following series .
with sens@@ ory Neurop@@ ath@@ y degree 3 treatment is to be subjected to an improvement of grade 1 or 2 , and with all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced .
there is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of the liver function ( see Section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
there were no studies in patients with imp@@ aired kidney function and there are currently no adequate data on the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to non @-@ sufficient data for in@@ fertil@@ ity and effectiveness .
Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane is an Alb@@ um@@ in @-@ linked nan@@ op@@ ar@@ tic@@ ulation formulation of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el that could have significantly different pharmac@@ ological features as other for@@ en@@ ations of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
when an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should immediately be removed immediately and a sympt@@ om@@ atic treatment should be treated immediately , and the patient must not be treated again with P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in the patients no further abor@@ ate treatment cycles should be derived until the neut@@ rop@@ hil@@ d has grown again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l , and the t@@ rom@@ bo@@ id number has risen again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver function ( Bil@@ ir@@ ub@@ in &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with det@@ ra@@ x@@ ane .
while a clearly proven car@@ di@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity is not detected , cardi@@ ac Inci@@ dents have not unusual , especially in patients with earlier anthrop@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or under@@ lying heart disease or lung disease .
in case of patients after the benefit of det@@ ra@@ x@@ ane nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting and di@@ arr@@ he@@ a , they can be treated with the usual anti@@ ques and sti@@ p@@ tive results .
Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant or at women in a bear@@ able age that does not use an effective conception , except the treatment of the mother with P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is und@@ am@@ fully compatible .
women at the age @-@ capable age should apply during and up to 1 month after treatment with det@@ ra@@ x@@ ane , a reliable contrac@@ eption method .
male patients who are treated with abor@@ ra@@ x@@ ane will be inspired , during and up to six months after the treatment is no child .
male patients should be advised before the treatment of a sperm cells , since the therapy with det@@ ra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of an ir@@ reversible in@@ fertil@@ ity .
Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane may cause side effects like ti@@ red@@ ness ( very frequent ) and Schwin@@ n ( often ) , which can work on the road ti@@ ghtness , and ability to serve machines .
following are the most common and most important inci@@ dents listed in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer that were treated in the pi@@ vot@@ al clinical phase III trial once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 se@@ ra@@ x@@ ane .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie was the most striking important hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ( 79 % of patients reported ) and was reported quickly rever@@ si@@ bly and dos@@ is@@ ers ; leu@@ k@@ open@@ ia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with abor@@ ra@@ x@@ ane patients and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
the side effects listed in Table 1 are listed in conjunction with the administration of det@@ ra@@ x@@ ane as mono@@ therap@@ ies at any dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) .
occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased l@@ act@@ de@@ hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , elevated blood sugar , blood sugar , elevated potassium in blood , reduced potassium in blood disorders :

o@@ acqu@@ is@@ ance 1 The frequency of the sensitivity transactions is calculated based on a defin@@ itive fall in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of actual frequency is possible and there was no correlation with these events .
P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti @-@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli active agent that promotes con@@ forming the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli from the tu@@ bul@@ let tubes and stabil@@ izes the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli by inhibit@@ ing their de@@ ol@@ y@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabil@@ ization leads to an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vit@@ ale phase and the erotic cell functions .
it is known that Alb@@ um@@ ine the transaction of plasma components in the endo@@ thel@@ ial cells and in the frame of in @-@ vitro studies proved that the presence of Alb@@ um@@ in transports the transport of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el through the endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
it is believed that this improved trans@@ endo@@ thel@@ ial transport through the g@@ p @-@ 60 album re@@ vit@@ ally convey@@ ors and due to the alb@@ umen protein SP@@ ARC ( wh@@ ich@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) occurs in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accum@@ ulation in the area of the Tum@@ ors .
the use of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two non @-@ m@@ apped studies and of 4@@ 54 patients who were treated in a random@@ ized Phase III study study .
in a study , 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with det@@ ra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an infusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as infusion in 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multic@@ entr@@ e study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer , which received every 3 weeks a mono@@ therap@@ ist with P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion for prevention of allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute infusion without medication ( N = 229 ) .
in the study , 64 % of patients had an imp@@ aired condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 met@@ ast@@ icity shots .
14 % of patients had previously received no chemotherapy , 27 % had a adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metast@@ ases and 19 % because of metast@@ ases and adju@@ v@@ ant adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .

10 According to an intraven@@ ous administration of det@@ ra@@ x@@ ane patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration increased in multi@@ phase mode .
the average distribution volume amounted to 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume has a far @-@ reaching ex@@ trav@@ ene distribution and / or individual binding of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study with patients with advanced tum@@ ors , pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ical properties of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was compared with intraven@@ ous 30 mg / m2 se@@ ra@@ x@@ ane with the values following a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 A solvent containing P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
the Clear@@ ance of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher ( 43 % ) after the Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane @-@ injection ( 43 % ) as after a solvent containing P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and also the distribution volume was higher ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ biological and tissue samples it is reported that P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el associated with 6@@ α @-@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) and 6@@ α -3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ Di@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the mean total dose is less than 1 % of the given overall dose with less than 1 % of the metabolism 6@@ α @-@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which has a far @-@ rich non @-@ ren@@ al cle@@ aring .

this means that wast@@ es is similar to an organic phar@@ maceuticals that is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and also contains the same active substance ( also called &quot; Reference Service &quot; ) .
it is used in patients with normal blood disorders that could occur in connection with blood trans@@ fusion complic@@ ations , in case before the procedure is not possible , and in which a blood @-@ loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected .
treatment with se@@ amed force must be guided under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases , which is indicated for the medicine .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a self @-@ grab@@ bing , se@@ amed into a v@@ ein .
injection can also be made by the patient or super@@ vis@@ or , provided an appropriate manual for this purpose .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al failure or in patients who receive chemotherapy , hem@@ ost@@ ell values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults , respectively between 9.5 and 11 g / dl with children ) .
the Iron values of all patients are used before treatment to ensure that no iron gel consists of , and iron ore should be administered throughout the treatment .
in patients who receive a chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems it may be caused by a ery@@ th@@ rop@@ oi@@ etic deficiency , or so that the body is not sufficient on body &apos;s own ery@@ th@@ rop@@ oi@@ et@@ in .
Er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ oi@@ et@@ in is also applied to operations to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reducing the consequences of a blood loss .
it is produced by one cell in which a gene ( DNA ) has been introduced to the formation of epoxy in al@@ fa .
se@@ amed was compared to administration in a v@@ ein during a study study of 479 patients who suffered kidney problems caused by ren@@ net problems .
at least eight weeks , E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o had been inj@@ ected at least eight weeks before they were either revers@@ ed or to have received E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
main indicators for the effectiveness was the change of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ b@@ values between the beginning of the study and the evaluation period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
in addition , the company also submitted the results of a study , in which the effects of under the skin fl@@ amed sub@@ du@@ ed with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o with 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy alone .
in the study with patients who suffered kidney problems caused by kidney problems , hem@@ og@@ lob@@ b@@ values of patients who were ro@@ amed on bott@@ led , were maintained in the same size as in those patients who still received E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison to the patients who received E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o , an increase of 0,0@@ 63 g / dl of the output value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effects of se@@ se@@ amed is an increase of blood pressure that can occasionally lead to symptoms of a cep@@ halopath@@ y ( brain problems ) like sudden , st@@ ech@@ ing mig@@ raine head@@ ache and confusion .
se@@ amed may not be applied to patients who may be ins@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against epoxy in al@@ fa or one of the other components .
se@@ amed under the skin is not recommended for treatment of kidney problems , because further studies are needed to ensure that this caused by allergic reactions .
the Committee for Human Medicine Act ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that stipulated in accordance with the rules of the European Union of evidence that the drug has a comparable quality , safety and effective profile as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company , se@@ amed st@@ amed , will provide information about the medical team in all member states , including information on the security of the pharmaceutical .

treatment of an@@ emia and reduction in adults with solid tum@@ ours , mal@@ ign@@ ant lymph@@ omas or multip@@ lic@@ ular M@@ yel@@ oma that receive chemotherapy and chemotherapy is the risk of cardiovascular status ( e.g. cardiovascular status , prior to chemotherapy ) .
treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate an@@ emia ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / l &#93; , no iron deficiency ) , if necessary measures are not available , or in@@ adequate measures , which require a large volume of blood ( 4 or more units blood with women ; 5 or more units of blood in men ) .
for reduction in foreign blood , se@@ ven@@ es may be applied in front of a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ edi@@ c intervention in adults without iron deficiency , with which a high risk of trans@@ fusion sensors can be expected .
HB 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml will not be applied , which can not participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous bleeding program .
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7,5 m@@ mol / l ) , except for pedi@@ at@@ ric patients with which the hem@@ ost@@ als concentration between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 m@@ mol / l ) should lie .
an@@ cho@@ mi@@ ym@@ pt@@ omas and compliance checks may vary depending on the age , gender and overall disease last ; therefore , the evaluation of individual clinical trials and sick@@ ness by the doctor may be necessary .
a rise in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ s by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mol / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients can occasionally be observed in one patient &apos;s individual hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values or under the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ - target concentration .
in view of this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bi@@ vari@@ ability should be tried on an appropriate dose management that hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / m@@ L ( 6.2 m@@ mol / l ) to 12 g / m@@ L ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) .
if the hem@@ ost@@ al value exceeds 2 g / l ( 1.25 m@@ mol / l ) per month , it exceeds the permanent hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value of 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) , the ep@@ et@@ in @-@ al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % .

due to contrast to the initial value of &lt; 1 g / µl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) or the Ret@@ ik@@ ul@@ o@@ zy@@ k count increased by &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared with the output value , a response to ep@@ et@@ in @-@ al@@ fa treatment is un@@ likely and the treatment should be canc@@ eled .
patients with mild an@@ emia ( hem@@ at@@ ok@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , in which the primary storage of ≥ 4 blood con@@ serv@@ ations required , should be bre@@ amed up at a dose of 600 mg / kg body weight twice weekly for 3 weeks before surgery .
with the Iron sub@@ stitution it should be as early as possible - for example some weeks before the beginning of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood screening program - that started to have large iron reserves prior to the beginning of the excav@@ ation therapy .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 i.e. / kg Epo@@ et@@ in al@@ fa , which should be given once a week for three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before the surgery procedure and the day of intervention ( day 0 ) .
in this case , Epo@@ et@@ in al@@ fa could pre@@ operative 300 i.e. / kg each 10 consecutive days , on the day of the intervention as well as 4 days immediately after the surgery .
alternatively , injection can be given at the end of the di@@ aly@@ sis via the hose of a thread , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ on@@ ical sal@@ ine solution to flush the hose and ensure adequate injection of the pharmaceutical in the cycle .
patients who explo@@ res under the treatment with some Er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ oids in an Er@@ y@@ thro@@ mb@@ ast@@ open@@ ia ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pl@@ asia , PR@@ CA ) should not be bre@@ amed or another Er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ in ( see section 4.4 - Er@@ y@@ thro@@ mb@@ ast@@ open@@ ia ) .

controlled clinical studies have no significant benefit that is due to the gift of ep@@ och@@ es when the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ ation is attributable to control of an@@ alysts and the prevention of blood trans@@ f@@ usi@@ ons required .
the ha@@ emat@@ ographic increase should amount to approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mol / l ) per month to minim@@ ize the risk of hyper@@ tension .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al failure and clin@@ ically evi@@ d@@ enter cor@@ on@@ ular heart failure or shock @-@ suff@@ iciency should not be exceeded under Section 4.2 recommended upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration .
according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ emia with Epo@@ et@@ in@@ suff@@ iciency in adults are not accelerated so that further di@@ aly@@ sis failure should not be accelerated so far .
with cancer patients under chemotherapy , a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between ep@@ et@@ in @-@ al@@ fa @-@ free and the Er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ in response should be taken into account ( patients who may have to be trans@@ coding ) .
if the slope is higher than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mol / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.1 m@@ mol / l ) , the dose must minim@@ ize the risk for possible thro@@ mb@@ otic inci@@ dents ( see section 4.2 ) of patients with chem@@ o@@ therap@@ y@@ conditional an@@ emia ( see section 4.2 ) with the goal of keeping the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ b@@ value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl .
the decision for application re@@ combin@@ ant Er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk assessment of the respective patients that should also consider the specific clinical context .
in patients who are provided for a major elec@@ tive orthop@@ edi@@ c procedure , if possible , before the beginning of the Epo@@ et@@ in @-@ al@@ fa treatment , the cause of an@@ emia should be investigated and treated accordingly .
patients who have under@@ lines a serious g@@ im@@ edi@@ c procedure should have an appropriate thro@@ mb@@ osis , as they have increased risk for thro@@ mb@@ otic and vas@@ cular diseases , especially in case of under@@ lying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , it cannot be excluded , for treatment with ep@@ et@@ in al@@ fa for patients with a starting line of &gt; 13 g / dl a increased risk for postoperative thro@@ mb@@ otic / vas@@ cular events may consist .
in several controlled trials , it was not demonstrated in ep@@ et@@ ine that they improve survival patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic an@@ emia or reduce the risk of tumor tissue .

A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is used for the treatment of the following diseases : oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a sick@@ ness , which makes the bones w@@ ells ) both for women and in men as well .
it is applied in patients with a high risk of fra@@ cture risk ( bone mar@@ es ) , including patients who have recently suffered a decrease of trau@@ matic sl@@ ump , such as the bone of the bone , a disease that changed the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get received at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip fra@@ cture should be taken in front of the first infusion to receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) or by injection into a muscle .
administration of Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( mean against inflamm@@ ation ) shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can reduce symptoms of symptoms such as fever , muscle p@@ ains , gri@@ pp@@ e@@ similar symptoms , joint pain and head@@ ache .
to treat the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of this disease .
since the active ingredient in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
in the first study almost 8 000 older women were involved with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of cycl@@ ine and hip fra@@ c@@ tures were examined over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis more than 50 years who had suffered a boun@@ cing structure ; the number of fra@@ c@@ tures were examined over a period of up to five years .
in Mor@@ bus , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was tested in two studies in a total of 357 patients and compared with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ onate ) for six months .

in the study with older women the risk of cycl@@ or@@ ters was reduced to patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) over a period of three years compared to placebo in placebo by 70 % .
compared to all patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( with or without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) , the risk of stro@@ kes was reduced by 41 % .
in the study with men and women with hip correction 9 % of the patients were under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) in comparison to 13 % of patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a occurs within the first three days after infusion , and are less frequently occurring inf@@ usi@@ ons .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a must not be applied to patients who may be ins@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ orus or any other components .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients at A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a are the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the inf@@ usi@@ ons and oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose ( extin@@ ction of bone tissue ) in a pine .
the manufacturers of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a provides re@@ conn@@ aissance material for doctors who prescri@@ bes A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , as well as a similar material for patients who explains the effects of the phar@@ maceuticals and should be noted when they should consult the doctor .

in patients with a recently conden@@ sed low @-@ trau@@ matic trap , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. oral or in@@ tr@@ am@@ us@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the first A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a @-@ In@@ fusion .
the incidence of symptoms which occur within the first three days following the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can be reduced by the administration of Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen , shortly after application by A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
patients with kidney problems ( see Section 4.4 ) In patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended since limited clinical experience in this group of patients .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary since the bio availability , distribution and elim@@ ination of older patients are similar to younger patients .
children and adolescents A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 because data is missing and efficacy .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( cre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , because this patient population is limited to only a limited clinical experience .
a pre @-@ existing hypo@@ thesis prior to the beginning of the therapy with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is sufficient to treat calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
because of the fast influence of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on the bone structure a temporary mort@@ om@@ atic mort@@ ar can develop , whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the infusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a occurs ( see section 4.8 ) .

the total body cle@@ ance is independent of the dose 5.@@ 04 ± 2,5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the infusion time from 5 to 15 minutes resulted in a decline of 30 % at the end of the infusion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( Plasma concentration against time ) .
a reduced cle@@ aring by cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ En@@ z@@ ym@@ met@@ ic substances is un@@ likely because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed in humans , because they are a weak or not a weak or ir@@ reversible , fuel @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ -

summary of the EP@@ AR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Fund Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee of Human Medicine Act ( CH@@ MP ) carried out the studies carried out in order to obtain recommendations concerning the application of the pharmaceutical .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( known as non @-@ ins@@ ulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) , where Met@@ form@@ in ( a diabet@@ ic medicine ) can not be applied . • It can be used together with another diabet@@ ic drug ( Du@@ al@@ therapy ) .
in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( particularly overweight patients ) , the met@@ form@@ in alone cannot be satisfied with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose .
in combination with a sulph@@ ur pul@@ p or ins@@ ulin , the previous dose of the PE therapy can be retained , except for patients with h@@ yp@@ og@@ ly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; this should be reduced to the dose of sulph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ fuel or ins@@ ulin .
this means that the body &apos;s own ins@@ ulin can be used better and sin@@ ks the blood sugar level , which means that type 2 diabetes is better .
for more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of acet@@ one was investigated in tri@@ ple@@ therapy ; patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sulph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ant , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for 3.5 years .
in the studies the concentration of a substance was measured in the blood ( gly@@ cop@@ y@@ li@@ zed hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) which indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tos led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c @-@ value , which allows to reduce blood glucose levels when using the doses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the Tri@@ ple@@ Therap@@ y study , the effect of the additional gift of Ac@@ tos for existing treatment with metast@@ ases and a sulph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ant showed a reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional gift of placebo led to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study , in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and ins@@ ulin was examined in 289 patients , patients receiving Ac@@ tos in addition to ins@@ ulin had increased by 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared with 0.14 % in the patients who received placebo .
the most common adverse events in connection with Ac@@ tos were vision@@ aries , infections of the upper respiratory trac@@ ts ( cold ) , weight gain and hypo@@ thes@@ a@@ esth@@ esia ( reduced sensitivity to stimul@@ ating ) .
Ac@@ tos must not be used in patients suffering from patients suffering from Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or one of the other components , even in patients with liver problems , cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency or diabet@@ ic K@@ eto@@ azi@@ de ( high ket@@ level - acidity ) .
it was decided that acet@@ one should be used as an alternative to standard treatment with metast@@ ases in patients with metast@@ ases should not be displayed when Met@@ form@@ in is not displayed .
October 2000 the European Commission granted the Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited approval for placing an account of Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to white , round , v@@ aul@@ ted and carry on one side the mark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AC@@ T@@ OS &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with ins@@ ulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is adjusted with ins@@ ulin and in@@ compatibility due to contra@@ indications or in@@ compatibility ( see Section 4.4 ) .
for use of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age , no data is available , therefore it is not recommended in this age group .
in patients who are at least one risk factor ( i.e. earlier heart attack or sympt@@ om@@ atic cor@@ related heart disease ) , the doctor should begin to start a de@@ compens@@ ated heart failure , the doctor should start the treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose .
patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency , weight gain or ec@@ om@@ me , especially those with reduced cardi@@ ac reserve .
patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency , weight gain and ec@@ om@@ me when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is used in combination with ins@@ ulin .
a cardiovascular risk study involving Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years of age with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and previously advanced mac@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease was performed .
this study showed an increase in reports of heart failure , which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased output liver cells ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the standard ) or with other signs of liver disease , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one can not be used .
if the AL@@ T mirror increases to 3 times the upper limit of the standard range , the liver parameters are as soon as possible , as soon as possible .
if a patient has developed symptoms which point to a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , Ober@@ bau@@ ch@@ ess@@ ness , fatigue , App@@ et@@ it@@ ess@@ ness and / or dar@@ ker Har@@ n , are the liver cells .
the decision whether the treatment of patients with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one should be continued until the demonstration of the laboratory has been derived from clinical assessment .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , a dos@@ is@@ dependent weight gain was detected , which can stir in fat deposits and is connected in some cases with a liquid requirements .
as a result of a hem@@ odi@@ l@@ ution combined with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , a significant reduction in the middle hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ s ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) .
similar changes were observed in comparative controlled trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ ost@@ or@@ r@@ its by 3.6 @-@ 4.1 % ) and to a lower extent in patients under Sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff and ins@@ ulin ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ s by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3,2 % ) .
as a result of increased ins@@ ins@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity affects patients suffering from Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or triple @-@ combination therapy with a Sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ant or as a double @-@ combination therapy with ins@@ ulin , the risk of dos@@ ed pl@@ yp@@ og@@ ly@@ ca@@ emia .
following the introduction of thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ons , including Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , an appearance or deteri@@ oration of a diabet@@ ic mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a was reported using a reduction of visual acuity .
it is un@@ clear if there is a direct connection between the in@@ gest@@ ion of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and the occurr@@ ence of mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a , but dec@@ eit@@ ful doctors should be aware of the possibility of a mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a , if patients suffer from visual acuity should be considered to be considered .
in a summary analysis of messages un@@ desirable events of random@@ ized , randomised , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one
the arith@@ met@@ ic fra@@ cture was 1.9 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one treated women and 1.1 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years for women who were treated with a comparative medication .
in the study , a study about 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , fra@@ c@@ tures were 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years ) , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 questionn@@ aires per 100 patient years ) with patients who were treated with a comparative medication .
the patients should be aware of a pregnancy , and if a patient wish a pregnancy or a patient , the treatment is ab@@ sent ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies for exam@@ ining the inter@@ actions have shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ en@@ on has no relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics or pharmac@@ ological dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , phen@@ pro@@ cou@@ mon and Met@@ form@@ in .
inter@@ actions with medicines that are met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed by these enz@@ ym@@ es , e.g. oral contra@@ dic@@ tiv@@ a , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Cal@@ ci@@ um@@ can@@ al@@ blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or are not expected .
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with the fibro@@ sis ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8- In@@ hibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase of the AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in order to increase the 3 times .
simultaneous use of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induction ) resulted in a decrease of the AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one at 54 % .
this is primarily due to the treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one which reduces hyper@@ ins@@ ulin and increased ins@@ ulin @-@ resistant ins@@ ulin and thus reducing the availability of met@@ abolic substr@@ ates for red@@ dish growth .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequently &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , single cases : unknown ( from this data is not estimated ) .
this lead to a temporary variation of the tur@@ mo@@ ors and the refra@@ ctive index of lens , as it also observed with other h@@ yp@@ og@@ ly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic substances .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T asc@@ ents than thre@@ e@@ fold the upper limit of the norm range is common equally among placebo but more rarely than in comparative groups under met@@ form@@ in or Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ant .
in a Out@@ come study in patients with pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease , the frequency of a severe cardi@@ ac disease was 1.6 % higher than placebo when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one bz@@ w .
since its market launch , rarely over heart failure in Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one has been reported , however , when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was used in combination with ins@@ ulin or in patients with heart failure in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese .
there was a summary analysis of noti@@ fications of random@@ ized inci@@ dents regarding bone fr@@ aud , randomised , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on groups and over 7,@@ 400 patients treated with comparative study groups .
over a period of 3.5 years of current pro@@ active study , fra@@ c@@ tures were treated at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) with patients who were treated with a comparative medication .
during taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms occur .
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one appears to work specifically for a activation of specific core re@@ mun@@ itions ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) ) , which results in the animal model to an increased ins@@ ins@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity of liver , fat and sk@@ el@@ eton muscles .
it could be shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduces the glucose production in the liver and increases peripheral glucose in case of ins@@ ulin resistance .
a clinical study of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one versus Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d as mono@@ otherapy has been continued for two years to investigate the time until the term of therapeutic efficacy ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 treatment months ) .
at the time after two years after onset of therapy , blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) could be found in 69 % of treated patients ( compared with 50 % of patients under Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study more than 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was adjusted in spite of ins@@ ulin and ins@@ ulin was random@@ ized to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or placebo .
in patients under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c - was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % , compared to the patients who still received non @-@ ins@@ ulin , reducing the ins@@ ulin dosage in the group treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one group .
in clinical trials over one year showed a statistically significant decrease in the album / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine quota in comparison to the output values .
the effect of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( mono@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus Plaz@@ ebo ) was tested in a small , 18 @-@ week examination for type 2 diabet@@ ics .
in most clinical trials , compared to placebo a reduction of the total plasma @-@ tri@@ glyc@@ eride and the free fatty acids and an increase of HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol and slightly , however clin@@ ically not significantly increased LD@@ L@@ - Chol@@ ester@@ insp@@ iegel .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years of reduced Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d the total pl@@ as@@ mat@@ ri@@ dd@@ lers and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol .
in comparison to placebo , under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , no statistically significant increase in LD@@ L Chol@@ ester@@ insp@@ iegel was detected , while under Met@@ form@@ in and Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de were observed .
in a study of 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one not only reduce the so@@ ber @-@ tri@@ glyc@@ eride level , but also improved trimm@@ ed tri@@ glyc@@ eride level , this also provides a effect on the tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ d absorption than also on h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ d synthesis .
in the pro@@ active study , a cardiovascular disease study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and previously advanced mac@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease were random@@ ized in addition to existing anti@@ diabet@@ ic and cardiovascular therapy conducted either Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or placebo for over a period of up to 3.5 years .
after the oral application , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is quickly res@@ or@@ absorbed , with the top con@@ cent@@ ations of an un@@ altered Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in plasma usually 2 hours after application .
on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV to efficacy in about the three times the efficacy of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal pronounced .
in Inter@@ actions studies , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one has no relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics or pharmac@@ ological dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , phen@@ pro@@ cou@@ mon and Met@@ form@@ in .
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with the fibro@@ sis ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induction ) increases and lowers the plasma concentration of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( see section 4.5 ) .
after the oral application of radio@@ active mark@@ eted Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in humans the mark@@ er was primarily found in the f@@ ences ( 55 % ) and to a lower extent in the har@@ n ( 45 % ) .
the medium plasma @-@ Eli@@ min@@ ation canal of un@@ altered Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours while the entire active met@@ abolic rate is 16 - 23 hours .
the plasma concentration of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function lower than in healthy volunteers , but the data of the oral Clear@@ ance is similar .
in tox@@ ic@@ ological studies , in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys agree after repeated administration plasma expansion with hem@@ at@@ ution , an@@ emia and reversible ec@@ cent@@ ric cardi@@ ac disease .
this is primarily due to the treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one that reduces Hyper@@ insul@@ ine emia and increased ins@@ ulin @-@ resistant ins@@ ulin and thus reducing the availability of met@@ abolic substr@@ ates for red@@ dish growth .
in long term studies ( up to 2 years ) , increased incidence of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( in male and female rats ) and tum@@ ours ( in male rats ) of the ur@@ ine epi@@ thel@@ ium .
in a wild model of family @-@ gra@@ vit@@ ality poly@@ pos@@ is ( FA@@ P ) , the treatment with two other Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ons led to an increased frequency of Kol@@ ont@@ op@@ ho@@ res .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to white , round , flat and carry on one side the mark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 30 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AC@@ T@@ OS &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the arith@@ met@@ ic fra@@ cture was 1.9 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one treated women and 1.1 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years for women who were treated with a comparative medication .
in the study , a study about 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , fra@@ c@@ tures were 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years ) , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 questionn@@ aires per 100 patient years ) with patients who were treated with a comparative medication .
in a further study about two years the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in each with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de were examined .
in clinical trials over 1 year showed a statistically significant decrease in the album / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine quota in comparison to the output values .
in a study of 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one not only reduce the so@@ ber @-@ tri@@ glyc@@ eride level , but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial increased tri@@ glyc@@ eride level , this can also be seen on the Tr@@ y@@ gly@@ z@@ eri@@ d absorption as well as to the h@@ ep@@ atic Tr@@ y@@ g@@ liz@@ eri@@ d synthesis .
although the study was missing the goal in their primary end@@ point , a combination of the overall mort@@ ality , stroke amp@@ utation above the root arter@@ ies , leg amp@@ utation above the arter@@ ial , cor@@ on@@ ary Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation and Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation of the leg arter@@ ies indicate that with the intake of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one there are no cardiovascular risk .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was able to produce a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes in which the pan@@ cre@@ as can not produce ins@@ ulin , and type 2 diabetes in which the body is not able to use the ins@@ ulin effectively .
in the study , after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ hy@@ li@@ zed hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured as well as the sugar level is adjusted .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror , pointing out that the blood glucose levels were similar to a different human ins@@ ulin .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be applied to patients who are possibly ins@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) to human ins@@ ulin ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
in addition , the doses need to be adjusted by Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane , if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can be applied to blood sugar ( the full list is to be found in the package age ) .
the Committee for Human Medicine Act ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the treatment of diabetes compared to risks .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted a approval to the European Union Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for placing the acceptance of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the entire European Union .
pre @-@ mixed ins@@ ulin products are usually applied once or twice daily , if a fast initi@@ alized effect can be w@@ ished with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be loaded under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose was inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood sugar is significantly improved by an intensi@@ fied ins@@ ulin therapy , the h@@ yp@@ og@@ ly@@ c@@ emia @-@ warning sympt@@ om may have changed and should be advised accordingly .
any change regarding strength , brand ( manufacturers ) , ins@@ ulin @-@ type ( fast effective , bi@@ phas@@ ic , long @-@ grade ins@@ ulin , human ins@@ ulin or ins@@ ulin analog ) and / or manufacturing method ( due to re@@ combin@@ able DNS opposite ins@@ ulin origin ) can result in that a change of dosage is needed .
if the switch to Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane is necessary to use a dose adjustment in patients , it may be necessary during the first dose or months after the conversion .
some patients with which h@@ yp@@ og@@ ly@@ k@@ ic reactions reported after a change of animal ins@@ ulin reactions reported that the early warning symptoms of a h@@ yp@@ og@@ ly@@ ca@@ emia was less pronounced than in their previous ins@@ ulin .
before travelling , which go beyond several time zones , the patient should be noted to get the advice of his physician , since such journeys can perform that ins@@ ulin and meals must be applied or taken at other times .
the doctor must therefore take into account possible inter@@ actions with the therapy and in@@ quire of them after other types of drugs .

however , a h@@ yp@@ og@@ ly@@ ca@@ emia can be gradually developing gradually : • Easy Hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ re boxes may be treated by the oral supply of glucose and sugar foods .
diabet@@ ics should therefore always be treated with glucose , swe@@ ets , bis@@ cu@@ its or sugar fruit juice . • Seri@@ ous Hyp@@ og@@ ly@@ re boxes with consciousness are treated with an in@@ tr@@ am@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glucose ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by a proven assistance or by glucose which is given to intraven@@ ous by the doctor .
the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum capacity is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total amount of work is up to 24 hours .
Res@@ or@@ ption The Res@@ or@@ ption profile is in the process that it concerns a mix of ins@@ ulin products with faster or delayed res@@ or@@ ption .

Aden@@ ur@@ ic is applied in patients with signs of cryst@@ all@@ ine deposits , including arthritis ( pain and inflamm@@ ation in the joints ) or tox@@ ins ( &quot; stones &quot; d. h . greater U@@ rat@@ ory deposits , which can lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the ure@@ acid is still over 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter , the dose may be increased to 120 mg once a day .
during the first treatment months , tox@@ ins can occur ; therefore it is recommended that the patients take at least further medicines for prevention of gyp@@ sy during the first six months of treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic .
the medicine is not recommended in children and in patients who had a transplan@@ tation , since it was not examined for these groups .
in the first study , on which 1 0@@ 72 patients participated , the effectiveness of three different Aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) were compared to placebo ( median drug ) and of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia treatment ) .
in the second study , two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of 300 mg daily ; patients with kidney problems only received 100 mg per day .
major Indi@@ cator for efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ inary tiles in the blood was under 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements .
in the first study 48 % ( 126 from 262 ) of patients , Aden@@ ur@@ ic at a dose of once daily 80 mg of income , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of patients who once daily use 120 mg of revenue once a day in the blood of under 6 mg / dl .
in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of the patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and at no one of the 134 patients in the case of placebo .
the most common adverse events of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ ache , di@@ arr@@ he@@ a , nau@@ sea ( Nau@@ sea ) , r@@ ash and abnormal liver values .
especially in patients with heart problems in the previous history , an increased risk of certain side effects , which affect the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Human Medicine Act ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering of the ur@@ ine blood in the blood . it was more efficient than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of adverse events in connection with the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia patients who have already led to U@@ rat@@ es@@ ag@@ ings ( including one from the patient &apos;s history and / or a plaster arthritis ) .
after 2 @-@ 4 weeks the serum levels still exceeds 6 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mol / l ) , a dose increase may be considered to AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily .
in patients with severe kidney restrictions , efficacy and safety has not been completely examined ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ - Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) .
children and adolescents , no experiences in children and adolescents , is not recommended by the use of Feb@@ r@@ ost@@ at in this patient group .

cardiovascular ill@@ nesses In patients with isch@@ or@@ ic heart disease or de@@ compens@@ ate heart failure , treatment with Feb@@ r@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see section 4.8 ) .
as with other har@@ n@@ ants drugs , it may occur during treatment of treatment , because of the lowering of the serum har@@ sh@@ acid infections initially in the tissue can be mobil@@ ized in the tissue .
B. for mal@@ ign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , L@@ esch@@ - Ny@@ han @-@ Syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in ur@@ ine in rare cases are so far to rise to storage in the ur@@ inary tract .
liver diseases During the phase 3 clinical trials , slight changes of the liver function were observed with Feb@@ r@@ ost@@ ost@@ at treated patients ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to perform a liver function before the beginning of the February treatment and subsequent processing . ( see Section 5.1 ) .
The@@ oph@@ yl@@ line Z@@ ones have been carried out not inter@@ ventions with Feb@@ r@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O inhibit@@ ors can lead to an increase in the@@ oph@@ yl@@ line ( a inhibit@@ ing of the met@@ abolic syndrome , also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
the simultaneous gift of Feb@@ r@@ ost@@ at and Nap@@ ro@@ xen was 250 mg 2 times daily with a rise in Feb@@ r@@ ost@@ at@@ ological exposition ( C@@ max 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .

Ant@@ it@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of an ant@@ acid is delayed by magnesium oxide and aluminum hydro@@ xi@@ de , the intake of Feb@@ r@@ ost@@ at ( around 1 hour ) and a decrease of C@@ max by 32 % , but no significant alter@@ ation of the AU@@ C causes .
pregnancy data on a very limited number of exp@@ on@@ ated pregn@@ an@@ cies may not include any side effects of Feb@@ r@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or health of fet@@ us / new@@ bor@@ ns .
animal experiments did not allow direct or indirect harmful effects to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) .
patients should be careful with the taxes of a vehicle , loading of machines or in exercise of hazardous activities until they are reas@@ onably assured that the AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC does not affect their performance .
a numer@@ ically higher incidence of cardiovascular disease was observed in the overall response study of Phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patient years ) and in long term - renewal studies ( 1.4 versus 0.7 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statistically significant differences were found and no correlation with Feb@@ r@@ ost@@ at could be detected .
the risk factors in these patients were an arter@@ ios@@ ally erotic disease and / or a my@@ oc@@ ardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compens@@ ated heart failure in the hospital &apos;s history .
frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occas@@ i@@ onal ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) effects , which could stand in the medicine groups with 80 mg / 120 m@@ g. of February , and in all February , more than once reported , are listed below .

there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in relation to the percentage decline in serum levels of subjects , regardless of their kidney function ( 58 % in group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with heavy kidney function ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub @-@ group of patients with serum har@@ ness concentration ≥ 10 mg / dl Around 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ act study ) had a serum concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
the collected data collected in two years showed that the durable lowering of the serum levels increased to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 357 µ@@ mol / l ) a decrease of incidence of tox@@ ins , so that less than 3 % of patients were required against a tox@@ ins ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients required against a tox@@ ins ) .
this was associated with a reduction of tox@@ ins size , which resulted in 54 % of patients a complete dis@@ appearance of gyp@@ sum no@@ des up to month 24 .
increased TS@@ H@@ - Values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ r@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.8 % ) in the open long time extension studies ( see Section 4.4 ) .

for doses of 120 mg and 300 mg is observed for Feb@@ r@@ ost@@ at an increase in the AU@@ C which is larger than the dos@@ is@@ proportional increase .
after taking a simple or multi@@ focal doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ max is about 2.8 @-@ 3,2 µg / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µg / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant changes in the percentage of serum levels were observed , unless this was checked ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent ste@@ ady state distribution volume ( V@@ s@@ s / F ) from Feb@@ r@@ ost@@ at is within range from 29 to 75 mg of doses ranging from 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma integration of Feb@@ r@@ ost@@ at amounts to approximately 9@@ 9.2 % ( primary binder on Alb@@ um@@ in ) and is reached via the concentration of concentration , which is reached with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
in vitro studies of human liver mic@@ ros@@ omes showed that these oxid@@ ative Met@@ abol@@ ites are made mainly by CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 8 or CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 9 , and that Feb@@ r@@ ost@@ at@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id is mainly formed by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 .

the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drink or use of other drugs ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
to avoid irrit@@ ation of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient may not continue until after the first food intake of the day , at least 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at and vitamin D3 is already used separately from each other in the European Union , the company submitted data before , which come from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study with 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to prove the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE regarding the increase of vitamin D mir@@ r@@ els .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D treatment was treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , low ( 11 % ) than those who were only Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at revenues ( 32 % ) .
the company also submitted data that the Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is exactly the dose that is required for preventing a bone loss .
the most common adverse events ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of the mus@@ cul@@ mination ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digest@@ ion apparatus , p@@ arr@@ ho@@ e ( di@@ arr@@ he@@ a ) , p@@ arr@@ ho@@ e ( ul@@ di@@ arr@@ he@@ a ) , mal@@ ul@@ ence ( ul@@ cer@@ ation ) , mal@@ ign@@ ant ( hat@@ ch ) , infl@@ ated abdom@@ en ( infl@@ ated stomach ) , as well as Sau@@ res .
in patients with more sensitivity ( allerg@@ y ) to Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , vitamin D3 or one of the other components may not be used AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
it may not be applied to disorders of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium level ) or in patients who do not stand at least 30 minutes .

the following references are to be precise to reduce the risk of mal@@ ign@@ ited irrit@@ ation and associated side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be di@@ pped after the day with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • The patients should not cr@@ ushed the tablet or the tablet in the mouth , as a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a . • The patients should not take place before taking the tablet for 30 minutes after taking the tablet .

the doctor should therefore call attention to all signs and symptoms that should be noted on possible mal@@ ign@@ ant reactions , and the patients should be advised on the occurr@@ ence of symptoms or retro@@ sp@@ ern@@ al pain or a new or dis@@ lim@@ mer@@ se so@@ aking the drug to apply and collect medical advice ( see section 4.8 ) .
3 The risk of severe mal@@ ign@@ ant side effects seems to be increased in patients receiving the medicine does not take correctly and / or after the occurr@@ ence of symptoms which should be taken on a mal@@ op@@ ic Ir@@ rit@@ ation .
it is very important that all doses of doses are given to patients and understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .

patients should be notified that they should be taken at risk of taking a dose AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE the tablet in the next morning after they noticed that .
they do not take two tablets at the same day , but intake of one tablet a week as originally planned to pass on the scheduled day of the week .
other conditions that affects the mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and h@@ yp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) , should be treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE therapy before the beginning of the therapy .

furthermore , the results of a clinical study was submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation , whereby the application was compared to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
the main indication of the efficacy was the number of patients with transplan@@ tation after a duration of treatment of one year ( as often as often a renewed organ transplan@@ tation or a re @-@ intake of the di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) .
in addition , more recent studies were performed to 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ tation and examined how Adv@@ oc@@ f is recorded in comparison to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft of the body .

only doctors who are tru@@ ant in the immune @-@ intensive therapy and the treatment of transplan@@ tations , this medic@@ inal products should be classified or make changes in the immune @-@ intensive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant issues of the system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , these can lead to gra@@ ft reactions or an increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or over@@ immun@@ o .
patients should always be maintained the same tac@@ tics formulation and maintain the corresponding daily dosage ; the formulation of the formulation or regime should only be placed under the tigh@@ tening control of one in transplan@@ tation ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
as a result of a change@@ over to an alternative formulation , therapeutic pharmaceutical monitoring and corresponding dose adjustment must be carried out in order to ensure that the system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains .
the dosage of for@@ agra@@ f should be primarily based on the clinical assessment of out@@ po@@ uring and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood @-@ level specifications ( see below &quot; recommendations
after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f at Adv@@ agra@@ f the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Tal@@ king should be controlled in the conversion and controlled over two weeks after conversion .
on Day 4 , the system@@ ic exposure measured as the valley level , both were similar to kidney stones and kidney @-@ sto@@ cked patients .
careful and repe@@ ating controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Tal@@ ks are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation under Adv@@ agra@@ f to ensure reasonable substance exposure in the immediate after@@ mat@@ isation phase .
since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low Clear@@ ance , an adaptation of the Adv@@ oc@@ f @-@ Dos@@ is@@ schem@@ as can take several days until the Ste@@ ady State reaches .
if the condition of the patient is not allowed in the first postoperative phase , the tac@@ tics treatment can be intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate on production of an infusion solution ) with a dose of ca .
duration of the application to op@@ pression of transplan@@ t measures , the immun@@ isation rates must be determined , therefore a maximum duration of oral therapy can not be specified .
Dos@@ is@@ recommendations - kidney transplan@@ t proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of gra@@ ft therapy should begin with 0,@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
further dose adjustments may be required later , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics of tac@@ tics can change in the course of stabil@@ ization of patients after transplan@@ tation .
dose Recommen@@ dations - liver transplan@@ t proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of gra@@ ft therapy should begin with 0,@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
dose recommendation - change@@ over from Pro@@ gra@@ f at Adv@@ agra@@ f must have taken a gra@@ ft dose of twice daily dosage of pro@@ ced@@ f capsules at a time daily intake of Adv@@ agra@@ f , this conversion has to be taken at a rate of 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , to the total daily dose .
kidney and liver transplan@@ tation After a change@@ over from other immun@@ o@@ il@@ va to Adv@@ agra@@ f once a day , treatment with the recommended initial dose of transplan@@ t and liver transplan@@ tation will begin to begin the proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of transplan@@ t .
heart transplan@@ tation In adult patients who are converted to for@@ agra@@ f , an oral initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day is taken once daily in the morning .
other gra@@ ft receivers , although there are no clinical experience with advanced lung cancer patients in a oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.15 mg / kg / day , in pan@@ cre@@ ast@@ oun@@ t patients at an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and at col@@ t transplan@@ t in a oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dose custom@@ iz@@ ations in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function For maintaining blood concentrations in the targeted range can be required in patients with heavy liver dysfunction .
patients with reduced kidney function Da ren@@ al function does not ex@@ erts any influence on pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics of tac@@ tics , can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required .
however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potenti@@ als of the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential ( including a regular determination of the cardi@@ oid function ( including a regular determination of the serum cre@@ at@@ ine level , a calculation of the cre@@ atine ) is recommended .
switch from Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ oc@@ f When the conversion from a Cic@@ los@@ a - on a Tac@@ oma @-@ based therapy is careful ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations on the valley level in the whole blood the dose should be based on the clinical assessment of out@@ po@@ uring and toler@@ ability in individual cases under the feeding of whole blood @-@ Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ valley level controls .
it is recommended to perform frequent controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley level during the first two weeks after gra@@ fts , followed by peri@@ odic controls during the maintenance therapy .
blood @-@ valley levels of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also be controlled after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f at Adv@@ oc@@ f , Dos@@ is@@ adaptation , changes to immun@@ opath@@ ic therapy or in simultaneous use of substances that could change the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us whole blood concentrations ( see section 4.5 ) .
since Adv@@ oc@@ f a phar@@ maceuticals with low cle@@ ance , custom@@ ization of the dose may need several days , until the Ste@@ ady State has entered .
the data in clinical trials include that a successful treatment is possible in most cases when the valley level should not exceed 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice , the valley level of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the whole blood was usually treated according to liver transplan@@ ts in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and re@@ transplan@@ t patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the subsequent processing of liver , kidney and cardi@@ ac transplan@@ t , blood concentrations were generally used in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml .
this has resulted in serious events , including reactions or other side effects , which may occur in the result of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us underwater or over@@ exposition .
patients should always be maintained the same tac@@ tics formulation and maintain the corresponding daily dosage ; statements of formulation or regime should only be made under the tigh@@ tening control of a medical field of transplan@@ tation ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft reactions , which proved to be applied to other immun@@ o@@ il@@ va than therap@@ ies , there are no clinical data for ret@@ au@@ ster@@ oid formulation .
to proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of transplan@@ t in adults with adult heart transplan@@ t and transplan@@ ts are currently no clinical data for rescue form@@ ulations Adv@@ ail@@ f before .
due to potential inter@@ actions which can lead to a down@@ turn of the tac@@ tic level in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effects of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the intake of vegetable preparations , the Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um penet@@ rating ) contain , or other plant ophthalm@@ ology during treatment with Adv@@ agra@@ f ( see section 4.5 ) .
in patients with di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea there is a particularly careful monitoring of tac@@ tics concentration in the blood , because the tac@@ tics of blood can be subjected to considerable fluctu@@ ations under such circumstances .
in rare cases , aqu@@ eous or sept@@ um hyper@@ t@@ rophy was observed under Pro@@ gra@@ f , which can therefore also occur under Adv@@ oc@@ f .
further factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are already existing cardi@@ ac disease , a treatment with cork , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver function , infections , fluid over@@ loading and furn@@ aces .
as with other immun@@ o@@ yst@@ er@@ si@@ va the influence of solar light or UV light should be restricted by suitable clothing or use of solar protection using a high protection factor .
if patients suffering from tac@@ tics , symptoms of wh@@ res like head@@ ache , changing awareness &apos;s condition , forces and visual disorders should show a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g .

the simultaneous use of medicines or plant remedi@@ es known as Hem@@ mer or In@@ hibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can alter the metabolism of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and therefore increase the blood values of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or lower .
it is therefore advis@@ able to monitor the tac@@ tics of blood with the benefit of substances that can change the CY@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and to set the tac@@ tics dose for maintaining the same concentration ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strongly distinctive interaction was done with angi@@ pur@@ ica such as K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , Flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and Vor@@ icon@@ az@@ ol as well as with the Macro@@ lid bi@@ otic Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in and HIV prot@@ eas@@ ant ( z ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ic studies shows that the increase of blood levels mainly from the enhanced bio@@ availability of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , due to the inhibit@@ ors of gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal refin@@ ement , results .
highly do@@ si@@ zed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as it is used with acute sever@@ ance actions , can increase the concentration of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood .
effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on the metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore , the simultaneous use of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , their metabolism will be imp@@ aired by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us res@@ cu@@ ed the Clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid contra@@ dic@@ tiv@@ a and thus able to increase the hormon@@ es , is particularly careful with decisions of recommended measures .
the results of animal experiments have shown that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can reduce the cle@@ ance of Pent@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital and phen@@ az@@ on , and their half @-@ time period may be extending .
the results of a low number of investigations to transplan@@ ts , do not provide evidence that under Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in comparison to other immun@@ opath@@ y a increased risk for un@@ wanted events in regard to the development and the result of pregnancy .

the number of cases in which of Cic@@ los@@ por@@ us had to be converted to Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 13 ) , was significantly larger ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients who were taken from Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us to Cic@@ los@@ a ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 580 ) .
the number of cases in which there was no doubt transplan@@ t , was after 6 months ( 5@@ 7,7 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) patients with the tac@@ tic patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us group is bigger ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 511 ) .

Adv@@ ate treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with hem@@ oph@@ ilia A ( caused by the lack of factor VIII , con@@ genital bleeding disorder ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application may be applied to the treatment of bleeding or the prevention of bleeding in surgical procedures .
patients with hem@@ oph@@ ilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency , causing blood @-@ problems like bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but is produced according to a method which is called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; :
it is produced by a cell that has been introduced to a gene ( DNA ) that it is capable of creating the human transmission factor VIII .
Adv@@ ate is authorised to another in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but it is different , so that the medicine does not contain any proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate H@@ äm@@ oph@@ ilia A , including a study with 53 children under six years , the application of the medicine was investigated for prevention of blood and surgical intervention .
in the main study , the efficacy of reactions in the prevention of bleeding within 86 % of the 510 new bloo@@ d@@ stream ten@@ ds were awarded with &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good . &quot;
the most common adverse events of advanced ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are Schwin@@ n , head@@ ache , py@@ re@@ xie ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII .
patients may not be applied to patients who may be ins@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against human transmission factor VIII , Maus@@ er or Ham@@ ster@@ protein or one of the other components .
in March 2004 , the European Commission granted a approval to the company B@@ ax@@ ter AG a regulatory approval in the European Union for placing on the market .
dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution , according to the sever@@ ity of factor VIII , according to the place and the extent of blood and the clinical condition of the patient .
in the following h@@ em@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events , factor VIII activity should not fall under the specified plasma level ( in % of the standard or in accordance with i.e. / dl ) .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repeat until the pain and acute impair@@ ment are eliminated .
injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients below 6 years ) repeat until the risk of the patient is over .
during treatment of treatment , the appropriate dose and frequency of inj@@ ections enrich@@ ed to factor VIII plasma tiles .
individual patients can distingu@@ ish in their reaction to factor VIII , various in vivo recovery and have different sem@@ esters .
3 proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis for long @-@ term proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of blood in patients with severe ha@@ em@@ oph@@ ilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 i.e. by factor VIII per kg of body weight within 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VIII plasma activities will not be reached , or if blood pressure is not ruled with an appropriate dose , a test must be carried out in order to prove your inhibit@@ or .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the factor VIII treatment is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures must be considered .
according to the patient &apos;s administration , the administration rate should not be exceeded , with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alizing Anti@@ bodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a known complic@@ ation in treatment of patients with ha@@ em@@ oph@@ ilia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ ko@@ ag@@ ulation activity of factor VIII and Ig@@ G Immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ine that are qu@@ anti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml of plasma using specially modified Beth@@ es@@ da Ass@@ ay .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors , cor@@ related with the extent of exposure to factor VIII , whereby the risk is in the first 20 ex@@ positions at the largest and of genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure days and an@@ am@@ ne@@ at@@ ous inhibit@@ or development , following conversion from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product to another , re@@ occur by ( lowest tit@@ res ) inhibit@@ ors .
due to the rare rise of the hem@@ oph@@ ilia A in women , there are no experiences about the application of factor VIII during pregnancy and breast@@ feeding .
in the largest number of patients the A@@ DR@@ s were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) who were all treated with previously untreated patients who have higher risk of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , not known ( frequency on the basis of available data is not estimated ) .
a ) The percentage of patients were calculated using the sum of the individual patients ( 234 ) calculations . ( 10 - 14 post@@ oper@@ able day ) in one patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE infusion .
blood pressure was calculated during the time and both the factor of V@@ II@@ I@@ - mirror in plasma and the Clear@@ ance Rate showed adequate values on 15 postoperative day .
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ ATE to 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed serious to moderate H@@ äm@@ oph@@ ilia A ( ≥ 150 days ) just a patient showed a low In@@ hibit@@ ors ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) .
in addition , there was none of the 53 pedi@@ at@@ ric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed serious to moderate H@@ äm@@ oph@@ ilia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) after previous exposure to factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) a F@@ VIII inhibit@@ or .
in the previously untreated patients of a current clinical study , 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) were treated with A@@ DV@@ ATE treated patients against factor VIII .
the immune response of the patients on traces of cont@@ amin@@ ating proteins was analyzed by the investigation of the antibody tit@@ res against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
one patient showed both a statistically significant upward trend towards anti @-@ Ch@@ o cellular protein , otherwise no signs or symptoms based on an allergic reaction or sensitivity .

based on the data subject , the CH@@ MP has still considered a positive value for use for the first time , however , considering that the safety profile has to be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore , the CH@@ MP reli@@ es on the basis of the safety profile of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which makes it necessary for all 6 months to apply a further renewal procedure for authorisation in 5 years .
in December 2008 , Gen@@ e@@ x Molecular Limited issued the Committee for Human Medicine Act ( CH@@ MP ) , proposed that the company takes its application on approval for the marketing of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
however , however , the breast , the brain , bones or wheat parts ( fabric , connecting other structures in the body , surro@@ unds and support ) of it .
it is a kind of virus that has been genet@@ ically modified to carry a gene in the cells of the body .
in the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in , there is a &quot; Aden@@ ov@@ irus &quot; which has been changed so that there is no copies of himself and therefore no infections be able to trigger people .
Adv@@ ant@@ in would have inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and allow the cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 @-@ protein .
the p@@ 53 protein which is formed from the non @-@ def@@ ective human body existing p@@ 53 gene , is usually contributes to the restoration of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be restored .
the p@@ 53 @-@ protein is def@@ ective , with which the p@@ 53 gene is def@@ ective , the p@@ 53 @-@ protein does not work correctly , and the cancer cells can grow further .
the company also submitted data from a study with a patient in front of the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the field of sub@@ species , into the bones and in the brain .
after the CH@@ MP answers to the company &apos;s answers to the questions , there were still some questions un@@ explained .
based on the exam of the initially submitted documents , the CH@@ MP submitted a list of questions that will be sent to the company .
according to the CH@@ MP view , no suff@@ ici@@ ently proved that injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ tum@@ ors benefit benefits for patients .
the Committee also concerns concerns concerning the processing of the medicine in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the pharmaceutical .
in addition , the company had not suff@@ ici@@ ently proven that we can be produced in a reliable way and that it is neither responsible for the environment nor for people who come in contact with the patient .
the company won &apos;t be aware of whether the withdrawal consequences for patients who currently has clinical trials or &quot; Comp@@ assi@@ onate @-@ Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; modified effici@@ encies &quot; means that the tablets are so assembled so that one of the effective constitu@@ ents are immediately released and the other will be released slowly over a few hours .
Aer@@ in@@ aze becomes the treatment of symptoms of seasonal allergi@@ es ( Heu@@ v@@ up@@ fen , caused by a allerg@@ y against poll@@ en inflamm@@ ation of the nose ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ c@@ ous hem@@ or@@ rh@@ age ( b@@ op@@ ed nose ) .
for adults and adolescents from 12 years the recommended dose of Aer@@ op@@ aze twice daily is a tablet that should be taken entirely with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and completed as soon as the symptoms , especially the sw@@ elling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( stopped nose ) .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drugs can be found in the nose .
the main content measurements were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the ha@@ v@@ ein oc@@ ul@@ pt@@ ome that were reported by the patients before the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients carried their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and evaluated with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
for consideration of all Heu@@ v@@ ac@@ z@@ ens@@ ym@@ pt@@ omas , the patient &apos;s con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation reported about a decrease of symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % , compared with 3@@ 5,9 % in the patients , the P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin alone income .
if only the sw@@ elling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was seen , the patients showed a reduction in symptoms by 3@@ 7,4 % versus 26.@@ 7 % in patients who have Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin alone .
the most common adverse events of Aer@@ in@@ aze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are speed@@ y@@ kar@@ st ( cardi@@ ac disease ) , phar@@ yn@@ g@@ itis ( phar@@ et@@ it@@ ess@@ ness ) , ob@@ struction , head@@ ache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
Aer@@ in@@ aze may in patients who may be ins@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) versus Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin or one of the other parts , against ad@@ r@@ ener@@ ate active ingredients or Lor@@ at@@ adin ( another drugs for the treatment of allergi@@ es ) are not applied .
Aer@@ in@@ aze may also be used in patients who suffer from a narrow angle glaucoma ( hyper@@ tension ) , cardi@@ ac disease ( hyper@@ tension ) , or hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ id ( over@@ function of thy@@ ro@@ id ) or caused by a hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic strike ( caused by a brain bleeding ) or have a risk of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic strike .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted a approval for the In@@ ver@@ ters of Aer@@ in@@ aze in the entire European Union on 30 July 2007 .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but it is all to kill ( i.e. without them to break or cut it ) .
Aer@@ in@@ aze should not be used for children under 12 years due to the absence of data for in@@ fertil@@ ity and efficacy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after cl@@ ing the symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days as long as long @-@ term application can take the activity of P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin with the time .
following the decline of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es , the treatment may be continued when needed with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin as mono@@ therap@@ ies .
since Aer@@ in@@ aze P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin contains , the medicine is also contra@@ sting in patients who are treated with a mono@@ amin@@ oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors or within 2 weeks after completion of such therapy .
this is attributable to alph@@ am@@ im@@ et@@ ical activity with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ ctors such as Bro@@ mo@@ th@@ iev@@ es , Per@@ g@@ oli@@ d , erg@@ ot@@ amine , Di@@ hydro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other decades ( phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , Eph@@ ed@@ rin , Oxy@@ met@@ ac@@ olin , Nap@@ ol@@ olin , etc . ) .
safety and efficacy of these combination therapy were not tested for this patient @-@ counter top le@@ vers and the data are not enough to submit relevant recommendations to the dosage .
safety and efficacy of aer@@ in@@ aze was not tested in patients with kidney or liver function and the data are not enough to submit relevant recommendations to the dosage .
patients need to be informed that the treatment at the occurr@@ ence of hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ ations or of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart rhyth@@ ms , nau@@ sea or et@@ ai@@ zing of other neurolog@@ ical symptoms ( like head@@ ache or ampli@@ fication of the head@@ ache ) must be removed .
in the treatment of the following patient groups , patients with cardi@@ ac arr@@ hyth@@ mia • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with my@@ oc@@ ardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction in An@@ am@@ n@@ ese , Diabetes M@@ ell@@ itus , bladder , or Bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ asmus in An@@ am@@ n@@ ese .
Aer@@ in@@ aze provides at least 48 hours prior to the performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , because Anti@@ hist@@ amine is otherwise positive reactions to prevent digest@@ ers to prevent or in their extent .
in addition to clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , where Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol was additionally administered , however , no clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions or changes of the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin were observed .
no significant differences between patients with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and the placebo could be noted , regardless of whether Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin alone or with alcohol was taken .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ad@@ enzyme was not yet identified , so that interaction with other drugs cannot be excluded .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in@@ hib@@ its in vivo CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 does not in@@ hib@@ its and neither a substr@@ ate even a inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ one .
the in@@ fertil@@ ity of the application of aer@@ ob@@ aze during pregnancy is not secured , experiences gained from a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies , however , no increase of frequency ab@@ normal@@ ities compared to the frequency of normal population .
since re@@ productive studies are not always transferred to humans in humans and on the basis of vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ ctor properties of P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin should not be used in pregnancy .
however , patients should be clari@@ fied however , that it may occur in very rare cases that may cause impair@@ ment of traffic or the ability to serve machines .
symptoms vary between a Z@@ NS depression ( se@@ dation , Ap@@ no@@ e , di@@ min@@ ated mental attention , cy@@ an@@ osis , Kom@@ a , heart @-@ circulation coll@@ aps ) and a Z@@ NS stim@@ ulation ( ins@@ om@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , volcan@@ ic acid ) with possible cl@@ aws .

a Z@@ NS @-@ stim@@ ulation is particularly likely to occur in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ in typical symptoms ( mouth @-@ dried , pup@@ il , and di@@ lat@@ ation , skin irrit@@ ation , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal symptoms ) .
these include both the in@@ hibition of the release of infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory cy@@ to@@ kin@@ en like IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / Bas@@ oph@@ ile , as well as the inhibit@@ ors of the arist@@ oc@@ ratic P @-@ sel@@ ess expression on endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no effect on standard measurements of flight performance including ampli@@ fication sub@@ jective battles or tasks that are connected to the fly .
in controlled clinical trials , a increased frequency of 5 m@@ g. daily was detected by placebo in comparison to placebo .
the oral application of P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin in the recommended dose may cause more sympath@@ etic effects , such as an increase of blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ ment or manifest@@ ations of a Z@@ NS .
1,@@ 248 patients ranged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergi@@ en@@ ic r@@ hin@@ itis with 414 patients received Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets .
in both studies , hist@@ amine ant@@ agon@@ ist effectiveness of Aer@@ op@@ aze Tablets was determined by the overall score for sympt@@ om@@ atic ( except Nas@@ en@@ schl@@ er@@ mination ) , significantly higher than under a mono@@ therap@@ ist with P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin over the 2 week treatment period .
the effectiveness of Aer@@ op@@ aze tablets with regard to the sw@@ apped effect , determines significantly higher than under a mono@@ therap@@ ies with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of Aer@@ op@@ aze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of sex , age , or ethnic origin .
in the framework of a single dose study of pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics by Aer@@ in@@ aze Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was veri@@ fi@@ able within 30 minutes after the administration in plasma .

as part of a pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ical multi@@ pl@@ dos@@ is@@ study , which was conducted with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects , it was noted that four subjects Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin po@@ or@@ ly ver@@ sely stain@@ ed .
a components interest study indicates that the exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin was bio@@ equivalent according to the exposure of a aerodynam@@ ic tablet .
based on conventional studies on security har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repet@@ itive administration , for ob@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and to re@@ productive acid the pre@@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin do not recognize any special haz@@ ards for human beings .
the combination did not ate more tox@@ icity than their individual components , and the observed effects were generally used in connection with the ingredients of P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin .
in re@@ productive protein studies , the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adin / P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin was not ter@@ med in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits at a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day .

A@@ eri@@ us was involved in eight studies involving approximately 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic Rhin@@ itis ( including four studies with seasonal allergi@@ en@@ ic r@@ hin@@ itis and two studies in patients who had as@@ thma ) .
the effectiveness was measured by the change of symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of p@@ add@@ ling , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance on days ) before and after six weeks of treatment .
further studies were submitted to prove that the body should take the sy@@ rup , the solution to insert and the processed tablets in the same way as the tablets and the use of children un@@ th@@ ink@@ able .
in an allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , when the results of all studies were taken , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease of symptoms ( symptoms of symptoms ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the approval of 12 to 26 % in the patients receiving a placebo .
in the two studies of Ur@@ tik@@ aria the decrease of symptoms after six weeks with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % compared with 40 and 33 % compared to placebo patients were treated .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be applied to patients who may be ins@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , Lor@@ at@@ adin , or one of the other components .
in January 2001 , the European Commission granted a approval to the European Union for placing an issue of A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union .
one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , to alle@@ vi@@ ate the symptoms of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic Rhin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there are limited experience from clinical trials to efficacy in the application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
treatment of inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic Rhin@@ itis ( occurr@@ ence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be eff@@ ected according to the previous disease and may be resum@@ ed after rest@@ oring the symptoms .
during persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( occurr@@ ence of symptoms of 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) the patient can be recommended during the allerg@@ y period .
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were not found in the context of clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin tablets , where Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol was administered additionally ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in@@ gest@@ ion and alcohol not ampli@@ fied the performance of alcohol before alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be clari@@ fied however , that it may occur in very rare cases that may cause impair@@ ment of traffic or the ability to serve machines .
clinical trials in different indications , including allergic Rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more adverse events in patients with A@@ eri@@ us when treated with placebo .
the most common adverse events , which was reported as reported in placebo ( 1,2 % ) , mouth @-@ dried ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ ache ( 0.6 % ) .
in a clinical study with 5@@ 78 you@@ thful patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common side effect , these occurred in 5.9 % of patients who were treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and were treated with placebo in 6.9 % of patients who were treated with placebo .
in a multi@@ disciplinary study , with up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( nin@@ ety clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
this includes both the in@@ hibition of the release of infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory cy@@ to@@ kin@@ en like IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / Bas@@ oph@@ ile , as well as the in@@ hibition of expression of hem@@ oph@@ onic P @-@ sel@@ ess on endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
in the framework of a clinical study with multi @-@ doses , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dosage of 45 m@@ g. daily ( the new@@ ly@@ times of clinical dose ) was given over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c interval can be found .
in a single dos@@ is@@ - study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no effect on standard measurements of flight performance including ampli@@ fication sub@@ jective battles or tasks that are connected to the fly .
in patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the alle@@ vi@@ ation of symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , Nas@@ en@@ secre@@ tion and Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z of the nose , it@@ ching , tear and bl@@ ends of eyes as well as Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z on the pal@@ ate .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic Rhin@@ itis can be divided in dependence on the symptoms of symptoms also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic Rhin@@ itis and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic Rhin@@ itis is defined as occurr@@ ence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis is defined as occurr@@ ence of symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
as the result of the total score on the loss of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ jun@@ tiv@@ itis was shown , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces path@@ itis due to seasonal allergi@@ es .
chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria has been investigated for further forms of the Ur@@ tik@@ aria , as the under@@ lying path@@ ophysi@@ ology remains similar to the e@@ at@@ ology in the different shapes and become an easy @-@ spec@@ ulation .
since the hist@@ amine extraction system is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin is expected to improve the prim@@ itive idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , also in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , which is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guides .
in two placebo controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the approach of size and number of qu@@ add@@ ling at the end of the first dose intervals .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ amine for chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , minority patients who did not react to Anti@@ hist@@ amine from the study .
improvement of the it@@ ching average by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with placebo patients compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and growth , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics study , in which the patients @-@ Dem@@ ograph@@ s were comparable with the general seasonal allerg@@ itis -@@ population was comparable to 4 % of patients a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin .
there are no vac@@ ant points for a clinical @-@ relevant cum@@ ulation after daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5- 20 mg ) over 14 days before .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ad@@ enzyme was not yet identified , so that interaction with other medicines will not be excluded completely .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in@@ hib@@ its in vivo not CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 does not in@@ hib@@ its and neither a substr@@ ate even a inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ one .
in a single dos@@ is@@ study with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fat@@ eful , cal@@ orie rich breakfast ) do not look forward to the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin .
the pre@@ clinical trials performed with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and Lor@@ at@@ adin in a comparable degree of exposure of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , no qualitative or quantitative differences with respect to tox@@ ic@@ at@@ adin and of Lor@@ at@@ adin .

clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were detected within clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , where Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol was administered additionally ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in@@ gest@@ ion of ap@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol is not inf@@ erior to the performance of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the total hardness of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up group similar to the placebo group .
in clinical trials with adults and adolescents in different indications , including allergic Rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , at the recommended dose , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us when treated with placebo .
in a multi@@ disciplinary study of adults and adolescents , with up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( nin@@ ety clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
children between 1 and 11 years old , who arrived for an anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy in question received a daily Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ind@@ osis of 1.25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic Rhin@@ itis / chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in adults and children can be similar to adults and children can be extra@@ pol@@ ated from des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in adults to children &apos;s population .
in the framework of a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dosage of 45 m@@ g. daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold the clinical dose ) for ten days in adults showed no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c interval .
in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents were not diagnosed with placebo in comparison to placebo .
in an individual daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets led to adults and adolescents in clinical trials with no impair@@ ment of the psych@@ ologists .
in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , it came neither from the simultaneous intake of alcohol either to a rein@@ forcement of alcohol induced power .

A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people for protection against influenza , caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N1 of influenza A virus .
this is a special kind of vaccine , which may cause a future pan@@ demic in front of a trunk of influenza .
an influenza pan@@ demic breaks out , when a new tribe of the flu virus res@@ ur@@ ns , which can easily spread from man to humans , because people still have no immun@@ ity ( no protection ) .
pursuant to the vacc@@ ination of the vacc@@ ination , the immune system det@@ ects the parts of the flu virus as &quot; body foreign &quot; and forms antibodies against it .
this helps the immune system in the position to form a contact with a Gri@@ pp@@ ev@@ irus of this St@@ am@@ ms faster antibody .
afterwards , the membrane cover of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which det@@ ects the human body as a body @-@ state ) , puri@@ fied and used as a part of the vaccine .
some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out in accordance with the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
as a result , the scope of clinical data base was not sufficient for ass@@ essing the safety of vacc@@ ination of vacc@@ ines required to meet the requirements of the EMEA ( EMEA ) guidelines .

for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , the gen@@ ase can not be used as a solution , but this can not be taken together with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the safety of this combination has not been investigated .
A@@ gen@@ ase should be de@@ ferred only then if the doctor has examined which an@@ tivir@@ al medicines of the patient previously applied , and the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood of medicines that the virus is being applied to the drug .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , taken along with twice a day 100 mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines .
in children between four and 12 years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gen@@ ase is aimed at body weight .
A@@ gen@@ ase reduces the HIV @-@ quantity in blood in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines in the blood and maintains it at a low level .
AIDS does not cure diseases , but can harm the damage of the immune system and that the development of AIDS associated infections and diseases are delayed .
A@@ gen@@ ase was examined in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines , but without R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults , previously untreated previously with prot@@ eas@@ ants .
with low @-@ resolution R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased drug A@@ gen@@ ase , with 206 adults , previously reported prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or was compared with other prot@@ ectors .
major inde@@ xes for efficacy was the proportion of patients with not det@@ ectable concentrations of HIV in the blood ( vir@@ us@@ load ) or the change of vir@@ al load after treatment .
in the studies with patients who had previously taken no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , after 48 weeks of under A@@ gen@@ ase , more patients had a vir@@ al load below 400 copies / ml than under Placebo , but A@@ gen@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gen@@ ase had also reduced the vir@@ us@@ load , but with the children who had been treated with prot@@ eas@@ ants earlier , only very few to the treatment .
in the study with adults who had been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , the vir@@ al load was just as effective after 16 weeks treatment as well as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or :
in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , it came under A@@ gen@@ ase to a stronger waste of the vir@@ us@@ load after four weeks as in the patient who continued to increase their previous proteins :
the most common adverse events of A@@ gen@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ ache , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ( di@@ arr@@ he@@ a ) , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , vom@@ iting , r@@ ash and F@@ atigue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gen@@ ase may not be applied to patients who may be ins@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r or one of the other components .
A@@ gen@@ ase may also be applied to patients , the Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( a vegetable preparation for the treatment of depression ) or medic@@ inal products , the same as A@@ gen@@ ase , and in high concentrations in the blood of health , are taken .
as with other medicines in patients who use A@@ gen@@ ase , the risk of a li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ rophy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , an oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose ( extin@@ ction of bone tissue ) or a immune response ( symptoms of infection that caused by changing immune system ) .
at the conclusion that the advantages of A@@ gen@@ ase came in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines referred to HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
A@@ gen@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ic amplifier R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the Committee set firmly that the use of A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who previously have not been previously reported prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
A@@ gen@@ ase was originally approved under &quot; extraordinary circumstances , since the time of approval from scientific reasons only limited information .
in October 2000 the European Commission granted the Gla@@ xo Group Limited approval for placing an am@@ per@@ ate of A@@ gen@@ ase in the entire European Union .
A@@ gen@@ ase is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or ( PI ) previously treated adults and children from 4 years .
usually , A@@ gen@@ ase capsules should be administered to pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ical Boo@@ gie of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r with low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r should be applied to the individual vir@@ al resistance of the patients and the pre @-@ line treatment ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio availability of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % less than one capsule ; therefore , A@@ gen@@ ase capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ grams per milli@@ gram basis ( see paragraph 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gen@@ ase capsules is 600 mg of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r twice daily with 100 mg it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines .
2 If A@@ gen@@ ase capsules are applied without the addition of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ gie ) , higher doses must be applied to A@@ gen@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gen@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics , efficacy and safety of a@@ gen@@ ase in combination with low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ections were not examined in children .
A@@ gen@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the absence of data for un@@ ctu@@ ality and effectiveness ( see section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic data , the dose of A@@ gen@@ ase capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with heavy liver dysfunction at 300 mg twice daily .
the simultaneous use of patients with mild or moderate liver function should be treated with severe liver function in patients with severe liver function ( see section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gen@@ ase may not be given simultaneously with drugs which have a low therapeutic width and also sub@@ str@@ ate of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ym@@ s 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
vegetable supplements , the Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um penet@@ rating ) must not be applied because of the risk of reducing plasma concentration and a reduced therapeutic effect of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be noted that A@@ gen@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy does not lead to a healing of HIV infection , and that it also continues to develop opportun@@ ist infections or other complic@@ ations of a HIV infection .
the present anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy , including the treatment with A@@ gen@@ ase , prevents the risk of transmission from HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually , apple capsules should be applied together with low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r and combined with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients who suffer chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy , have an increased risk for heavy liver effects associated with potentially fatal course .
for the case of simultaneous tivir@@ al Treatment of hepatitis B or C , please refer to the technical information of this medicine .
patients with existing reduced liver function including chronic hepatitis hepatitis indicate an increased frequency of liver function under a anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous use of A@@ gen@@ ase and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ tic@@ ason or other glucose co@@ ids , which are to be changed via CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , it is not recommended that the possible use of a treatment is the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ ic@@ os@@ ero@@ i@@ der effects including Mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of the ad@@ oration function ( see section 4.5 ) .
since the deteri@@ oration of the H@@ MG Co@@ a Re@@ duc@@ t@@ ase @-@ Hem@@ mer Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly recommended by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous administration of A@@ gen@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of My@@ opath@@ ic including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ ys@@ sen .
4 For some medicines that may cause severe or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects like Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under the monitoring of the International norm@@ alised ratio ) , methods to determine the concentration of active concentration .
in patients who use this medicine at the same time , a@@ gen@@ ase may be less effective because of reduced plasma tiles ( see section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of met@@ abolic interaction with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hor@@ m@@ onal contrast can be changed , however , the information is not sufficient to appreciate the type of inter@@ actions .
when meth@@ ad@@ on is given at the same time with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored to O@@ pi@@ at@@ ent@@ ss@@ ym@@ ome , especially if it is also given low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
due to the possible risk of tox@@ icity , due to the high propylene gly@@ col in the A@@ gen@@ ase solution , this gut form is con@@ tra @-@ inde@@ xed among children under the age of four years and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups .
gen@@ eric @-@ gen@@ ase should be set to duration 5 if a skin r@@ ash of system@@ ic or allergic symptoms are accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
in patients who received anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy , including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , was reported about the occurr@@ ence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ glyc@@ emia or an expression of an existing type of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other diseases associated with drugs , associated with the development of a diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ glyc@@ emia .
B. higher age , and with pharmaceutical @-@ dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment and associated met@@ abolic disorders .
in h@@ ym@@ iles patients ( type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ ectors , reports on an increase of bleeding including the spont@@ aneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ oma and hem@@ mar@@ thro@@ sen .
with HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , a anti @-@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy ( ART ) can develop a infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory reaction to the symbol or resi@@ du@@ al opportun@@ ist infections which leads to severe clinical state or deteri@@ oration of symptoms .
although a multi @-@ fac@@ t@@ orial equ@@ est@@ ology is accepted ( including use of cor@@ tic@@ ero@@ ids , alcohol consumption , heavy immun@@ isation , higher Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ) , were reported cases of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose in patients with advanced HIV @-@ disease and / or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy ( ART ) .
CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 Sub@@ str@@ ate with low therapeutic width A@@ gen@@ ase may not be given simultaneously with drugs which have a low therapeutic width and also sub@@ str@@ ate of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ym@@ s 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 Sub@@ str@@ ate with low therapeutic width A@@ gen@@ ase with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r cannot be used together with drugs which are mainly exchanged via CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and are used for increased plasma tiles with serious and / or life @-@ threat@@ ening effects .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r that can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical dec@@ or and can lead to a resistance development .
during an attempt to compens@@ ate the lowest plasma tiles by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very often un@@ desirable effects of the liver were observed .
Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um penet@@ rating ) The serum levels of det@@ on@@ ca@@ r can be hum@@ bled by the simultaneous use of vegetable zu@@ cchini with Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um penet@@ rating ) .
if a patient takes place in the Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut are the amber mirror and , if possible , add the Vir@@ us@@ load and add the cur@@ rant .
a dose custom@@ ization for one of the drugs is not required if Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ pp@@ ir@@ enz below ) .
508 % increase , when C@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , when R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) is administered in combination with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg of ampl@@ itudes have been applied twice daily and ra@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily to prove the effectiveness and un@@ th@@ ink@@ able of this treatment schem@@ atic .
52 % lower when Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) is administered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg L@@ op@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were obtained from Am@@ b@@ ra ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg L@@ op@@ in@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
a dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , it is recommended , however , it is not known , because the effectiveness and un@@ th@@ ink@@ able of this combination is not known .
there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ical study on the use of A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ in combination , however , is recommended that the revenues of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gen@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see Ant@@ azi@@ da below ) .
therefore , in combination with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dose adjustments required .
treatment with egg ir@@ ence in combination with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended since the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or would be low .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin to other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or and existing limited data can be avoided that Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin possibly reduces the serum concentration of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r .
if this medication should be used simultaneously , be careful because Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din due to the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma level could be less effective .
if this medicine is used together , be careful ; a thor@@ ough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical surveillance should be made , since a precise forec@@ asting of the effect of Am@@ ber avi@@ r and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r is hard to be hard .
the simultaneous administration of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ b@@ ut@@ in resulted in an increase in the Plas@@ ma@@ con@@ dens@@ ation ( AU@@ C ) of Ri@@ y@@ ut@@ in by 193 % , resulting in a rise in rift @-@ related side effects .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons , ri@@ pen@@ ut@@ in combined with A@@ gen@@ ase , is advis@@ able to reduce the dose of ri@@ pen@@ ut@@ to at least half of recommended dose , although there are no clinical data available .
pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ical studies with A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in were not performed , but the plasma tiles of both drugs could be increased in case of simultaneous administration .
simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg F@@ os@@ amp@@ os and 100 mg pen@@ it@@ on@@ ca@@ r with 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole led to 2.@@ 69@@ fold daily compared to the value that was observed after 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol once daily with no simultaneous use of F@@ os@@ amp@@ os with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines that are listed below are also sub@@ str@@ ate , inhibit@@ or or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , if they are applied together with A@@ gen@@ ase , possibly to inter@@ actions .
patients should therefore be monitored by toxic reactions , which are connected to these drugs , if they are applied in combination with A@@ gen@@ ase .
based on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , it is advis@@ able that ant@@ acids should not be taken at the same time as A@@ gen@@ ase , as there can be res@@ or@@ ption disorders .
the simultaneous use of anti@@ vul@@ tures , known as the enzyme induc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in ) , with Am@@ b@@ ca@@ r can lead to a hum@@ ili@@ ent of the plasma tiles of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r .
the serum concentration of calcium plugs such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , di@@ ode pin , ro@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ di@@ pin , pine and de@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased from 10 by Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , which may increase the activity and tox@@ icity of this medicine .
the simultaneous intake of a@@ gen@@ ase can increase considerably and increase plasma concentrations in combination with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in connection side effects including h@@ yp@@ ot@@ omy , vision@@ aries and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study conducted at R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily with 50 µg of fluor@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) , while the endo@@ genous K@@ ort@@ is@@ ol increased by about 86 % ( 90 % reduction interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous gift of A@@ gen@@ ase with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended together with these Glu@@ kok@@ or@@ chi@@ ids , unless the possible use of a treatment is the risk of system@@ ic acid @-@ ero@@ i@@ der effects ( see Section 4.4 ) .
with H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ a Re@@ duc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose deteri@@ oration is strongly influenced by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , there are projected enh@@ ancing the plasma tiles to the simultaneous administration of A@@ gen@@ ase .
since plasma @-@ level increases of these H@@ MG Co@@ a reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors to My@@ opath@@ y , including a R@@ eign dom@@ y@@ ol@@ ys@@ is , the combined use of these drugs is not recommended at Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r .
it is recommended for frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations as a stabil@@ ization of mirrors , as the plasma concentration of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ yc@@ in and Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us may be increased for the benefit of ampl@@ itudes ( see section 4.4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gen@@ ase may not be applied together with an or@@ ally recorded Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) while maintaining A@@ gen@@ ase application with par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ectors indicate a possible increase in plasma tiles from Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around 3 to 4 feet .
when meth@@ ad@@ on is administered together with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored to O@@ pi@@ at@@ ent@@ ss@@ ym@@ ome , especially if it is also given low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
because of the low distortion of historical compar@@ ability , there is currently no recommendation to adjust how Am@@ b@@ lown up is administered at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ on .
for simultaneous treatment of war@@ far@@ in or other or@@ ical antibodies with A@@ gen@@ ase , a increased control of IN@@ R ( International norm@@ alised ratio ) is recommended because of the possibility of a weak or rein@@ forcement of the anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hor@@ m@@ onal contrast agent is not predic@@ table , hence alternative methods for recipi@@ ent prevention is recommended .
a careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( e.g. Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ til@@ in ) is recommended for the benefit of as@@ ive bladder ( see section 4.4 ) .
this medication may only be used during pregnancy only after careful usage of the possible user for the mother in comparison with the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
in the milk activated rats , Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected , but it is not known whether Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r is over@@ flowing into breast milk .
a re@@ productive study of dam@@ aging rats who was administered by the feeding of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r in the u@@ terus until the end of the breast@@ feeding was reduced to 12 body weight during the breast@@ feeding time .
the further development of re@@ aring , including fertil@@ ity and re@@ productive capacity was not imp@@ aired by the administration of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r .
the distur@@ b@@ ability of A@@ gen@@ ase was studied in adults and children from 4 years in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines .
the side effects associated with the A@@ gen@@ ase treatment were slightly up to moderate , coming up early and led to the treatment breakdown .
in many of these events it is not clari@@ fied , whether they are related to the use of A@@ gen@@ ase or another simultaneously on HIV treatment , or whether they are a result of the under@@ under@@ disease .
most of the side @-@ mentioned side effects origin@@ ate from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 3@@ 001 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which with prot@@ ections of non @-@ treated patients received 1200 mg of A@@ gen@@ ase twice daily .
events ( degree 2 to 4 ) , which were util@@ ised by the investig@@ ator as described in connection with the study medication , and at more than 1 % of patients , as well as under the treatment of treatment ( degree 3 to 4 ) .
the anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy was associated with HIV patients ( li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ rophy ) with HIV @-@ patients , including a loss of peripheral fat tissue , increased intra@@ ocular and vis@@ cer@@ al fatty t@@ issues , hyper@@ t@@ rophy of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ vi@@ c@@ erv@@ ical fat collection ( Sti@@ ff@@ les ) .
at 113 anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al non @-@ treated people who were treated with Am@@ b@@ v@@ ud@@ in / Z@@ id@@ ov@@ ud@@ in , a medium term of 36 weeks , was observed only one case ( Sti@@ ff@@ les ) ( &lt; 1 % ) .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 patients came under Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) in comparison to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 241 patients under in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with various N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a medium term of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.001 ) .
skin envelop@@ es were normally slightly up to moderate , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or ma@@ cul@@ op@@ ap@@ ult nature , with or without Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z and stood spont@@ ane@@ ously during the second treatment week , and disappeared spont@@ ane@@ ously within two weeks , without the treatment with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r had to be canc@@ eled .
oste@@ on@@ c@@ ros@@ is reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV @-@ disease or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy ( ART ) .
in case of HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , a anti @-@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy ( ART ) can develop a infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory reaction to the symbol or resi@@ du@@ al opportun@@ ist infections ( see Section 4.4 ) .
with PI pre @-@ treated patients who received 600 mg of A@@ gen@@ ase twice daily , were similar and frequency of side effects ( degree 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( degree 2 to 4 ) and laboratory Changes ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were observed , an exception of the tri@@ glyc@@ eride and CP@@ K values , which received with low glyc@@ eri@@ ed R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , extremely common .
in case of an over@@ dosage the patient is observed on the signs of an in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) , if necessary , necessary support measures are necessary .

the an@@ tivir@@ al activity of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was investigated both acute and chronic l@@ ympho@@ cy@@ ber@@ ic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , C@@ em @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood l@@ ympho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ p concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r is increased in the range from 0,0@@ 12 to 0.08 µ@@ M when acute cells and is 0,@@ 41 µ@@ M when diagnosed in chronic cells .
the connection between the activity of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the inhibit@@ ors of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication on human beings are not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al non @-@ treated patients with the currently approved F@@ os@@ amp@@ os / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r doses have been observed - as with other R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r z@@ oo@@ king treatment schem@@ as with prot@@ eas@@ ant inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described only rarely .
at sixteen years of 434 anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al not treated patients who received 700@@ mg F@@ os@@ amp@@ os with 100@@ mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in the study ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 , a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure could be examined up to week 48 , with 14 isol@@ ates gen@@ otyp@@ ically .
gen@@ otyp@@ ical analysis of the isol@@ ate of 13 of 14 children , with which a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure in the 59 was included , with prot@@ eas@@ iness of non @-@ treated patients showed resistance pattern , which were similar to those in adults .

in the study AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg F@@ os@@ amp@@ os / 100 mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) participated in patients with four @-@ rolog@@ ical fail@@ ures over 96 weeks , the following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
on gen@@ otyp@@ ical resistance @-@ based analysis of gen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be applied to estim@@ ation of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for F@@ os@@ amp@@ os / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r defined resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 147@@ A / V / W / V , I@@ 84@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in conjunction with an increased phenom@@ enal resistance to F@@ os@@ amp@@ os with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r as well as a reduced probability of a vi@@ rolog@@ ical response ( resistance ) .
conclusions with regard to the relev@@ ance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation model can be subject to additional data , and it is recommended to always take the current interpretation systems for analysis of resistance tests .
based on phen@@ otyp@@ ical resistance tests , clin@@ ically vali@@ dated phenom@@ ena systems can be used in connection with gen@@ otyp@@ ical data for estim@@ ation of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .

each of these four with a reduced sensitivity against Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r associated genet@@ ically creates a certain cross @-@ resistant against R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity against In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved .
there are currently data available to the cross @-@ resistance of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and other Prot@@ ected Materials for all 4 F@@ os@@ amp@@ os Resist@@ or Resist@@ ers , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
based on five @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al were not pre @-@ treated patients with which a resistance against L@@ op@@ in@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , inj@@ un@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
in reverse , Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ret@@ ains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent upon the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
early demol@@ ition of a fail@@ ing therapy is recommended to keep the accum@@ ulation of a variety of nuts in the limits which can be applied to the subsequent treatment of treatment .
the validity of the efficacy of A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a randomised open study , together with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( N@@ RT@@ I ) or a standard of therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , mainly with a lower R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; geb@@ oo@@ st@@ ert . &quot;
one hundred and sixty ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity compared to A@@ gen@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I were included in the sub@@ study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis presented the non @-@ per@@ plex@@ ity of AP@@ V / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the time adjusted average change ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the plasma load ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ le@@ gen@@ al fluctu@@ ation of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the cover of the efficacy of un@@ inten@@ tional A@@ gen@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials with a total of 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged between 2 and 18 years , of which 152 were treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ gen@@ ase Solution were applied twice daily , 20 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
no low @-@ dose r@@ it@@ on@@ vi@@ r was given at the same time ; the majority of the patients treated with PI had previously treated at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s .
after 48 weeks , about 25 % of the patients included a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml for an median increase in CD@@ 4 cells of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared with the initial value .
19 Based on these data should be considered to be considered to be considered to be considered for the benefit of &quot; un@@ used &quot; A@@ gen@@ ase &quot; with PI .
after oral administration , the mean duration ( T@@ max ) to the maximum serum concentration of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
508 % increase when C@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) is administered together with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease of AU@@ C but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosing ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady state ( C@@ min , s@@ s ) was un@@ affected by the food intake , although the simultaneous food intake affects the magnitude and rate of res@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and can close to a large distribution volume as well as a residual penetration of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r from the blood flow in the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the concentration of active substances in plasma , although the amount of un@@ bon@@ ito b@@ lown up , representing the active proportion , probably unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ used am@@ per@@ avi@@ r remain constant , the percentage of free active components fluctu@@ ates during the dosing interval at the Ste@@ ady @-@ state concentration in the Ste@@ ady @-@ State , until C@@ min , s@@ s until C@@ min , s@@ s .
therefore we need to modify the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induced or in@@ hib@@ itions or a substr@@ ate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 to be careful when they are given at the same time with A@@ gen@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift from A@@ gen@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily ambul@@ ance exposure such as adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily .
Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r is 14 % less bio @-@ available as from the capsules ; therefore A@@ gen@@ ase solution and A@@ gen@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a million@@ aire basis .
also the ren@@ al cle@@ ance of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r neg@@ le@@ gible , therefore the effect of a ren@@ al function should be low to elim@@ ination of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these treatment schem@@ es lead to Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r plasma samples which are treated to healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r twice daily without simultaneous administration of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .

the 21 under@@ lying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ epat@@ oc@@ ul@@ ars Aden@@ ome and Kar@@ zin@@ ome has not been clari@@ fied and the relev@@ ance of these observed effects for human beings is un@@ clear .
however , out of this occupational exposure data on humans , both clinical trials as well as from the therapeutic application , however , there were little evidence for accept@@ ing a clinical relev@@ ance of these findings .

these liver tox@@ icity can be monitored and detected in clinical everyday life through measurement of AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
so far in clinical trials no significant liver tox@@ icity in patients were observed , neither during the administration of A@@ gen@@ ase even after the end of treatment .
studies on tox@@ icity in ma@@ iden who were treated at the age of 4 days showed a high mortality in the control of bovine animals as well as with the Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r @-@ animals .
with an system@@ ic plasma exposition which was significantly below ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure of therapeutic dosage in humans , however , a number of slight changes including th@@ ym@@ us@@ el@@ ong@@ ation and a significant sk@@ el@@ eton changes were observed , which point to a delayed development .
24 If A@@ gen@@ ase capsules are applied without the addition of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ gie ) , higher doses must be applied to A@@ gen@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gen@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .

a dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , it is recommended , however , it is not known , because the effectiveness and un@@ th@@ ink@@ able of this combination is not known .
treatment with egg ir@@ ence in combination with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended since the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or would be low .

in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than the placebo in all four main studies , but only 3 % to 18 % were treated with placebo . • The results of both studies in bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma showed a full treatment rate of 66 % to 80 % compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group .
the most common adverse events of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions to the use of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
clin@@ ically typical , non @-@ hyper@@ ker@@ at@@ otic ker@@ at@@ os@@ hen ( A@@ K@@ s ) in the face or on the scal@@ p of immune competent adults , if the size or number of les@@ ions are effectiveness and / or the acceptance of a cr@@ yo@@ therapy and other top@@ ical treatment options are inde@@ xed or less suitable .
leave on Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday ) and leave the skin for 6 to 10 hours .
treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is so long for@@ tz@@ ing until all visible fol@@ ds in the genital or peri@@ odic area have disappeared , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
an inter@@ ruption in the above @-@ described treatment procedure should occur when intensive local inflamm@@ ation occur ( see Section 4.4 ) or if an infection is observed in the treatment area .
if follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period , les@@ ions were only incomplete , another therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) .
when a dose was left out , the patient would bear the cream as soon as it not@@ ices and then proceed with the usual therapeutic plan .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is rec@@ ap@@ ed in a thin layer and then used to gr@@ ate the skin with folding war@@ nings until the cream is completely sealed .
it should be observed in these patients between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk of risk of its auto@@ immune disease .
it should be observed in these patients between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk of a possible organ or Gra@@ ft versus @-@ host@@ - reaction .
in other studies , in which no daily pre@@ h@@ auth@@ y@@ gi@@ ene was performed , two cases of severe ph@@ im@@ osis was observed , and a case with a similar pione@@ ering phase were observed .
at an application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than the recommended doses , an increased risk for heavy local skin irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ation were observed , which resulted in treatment and / or resulted in a temporary physical impair@@ ment .
in cases where such reactions appeared at the output of the ure@@ th@@ ra , some women encoun@@ tered difficulties when water , which needed a emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area .
for use I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream immediately following a treatment with other cut@@ aneous vibr@@ ations for the treatment of external subjects in the genital area and peri@@ odic area have not currently no clinical experience .
limited data indicate an increased rate of f@@ eig@@ war@@ cen@@ ions in HIV @-@ positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od . in this case group , however , has shown less effectiveness in this patient group .
treatment of the bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the eyel@@ ids , the nose , the lips or the hair rate was not examined .
local skin actions are frequently , but the intensity of these reactions are in general during therapy or the reactions form after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if it is necessary due to the complaints of the patients or because of the sever@@ ity of local skin actions , a treatment period of several days may be made .
the clinical outcome of therapy can be judged after the re@@ generation of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the treatment .
since currently no data on long @-@ term healing rates are available from more than 36 months after treatment , should be drawn in super@@ flu@@ ence bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma other suitable therapy forms .
patients with recur@@ rent or pre @-@ treated B@@ CC@@ s are no clinical experience , therefore the application is not recommended in pre @-@ treated tum@@ ors .
data from an open clinical study indicates that at large tum@@ ours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 cm2 ) a lower probability of response to the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy exists .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has not been studied for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ balls on eyel@@ ids , inside the nose or ears or on the lip@@ ses zone within the lip .
there are only very limited data on the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ oses to anatom@@ ical positions outside the face and the scal@@ p .
the available data on the ak@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis in the poor and hands will not support the effectiveness in this application , therefore , a such application is not recommended .
local skin actions occur frequently , but this reactions normally take in the course of therapy to intensity or go back to the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if local skin actions cause lot of dis@@ comfort or very strong , the treatment can be suspended for a few days .
out of the data from an open clinical study showed that patients with more than 8 active les@@ ions have been recorded as patients with fewer than 8 les@@ ions .
due to the immune stimul@@ ating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od is supposed to be treated with caution in patients who receive an immun@@ ore@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
there are no direct or indirect harmful effects to the pregnancy , embry@@ onic / f@@ og@@ ale development , the binding or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) .
although neither by single @-@ time application of qu@@ anti@@ fied serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) , no recommendation can be given during the breast@@ feeding time .
most frequently , or possibly using the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in connection @-@ related side effects in studies with three times weekly treatment were local reactions at the location of F@@ eig@@ ni@@ zen ( 3@@ 3.7 % of treated patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the most frequently reported and probably or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in connection side effects include complaints at the application place with a frequency of 28,@@ 1 % .
the Bas@@ ali@@ om @-@ patients treated from 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in a placebo @-@ controlled clinical study reported side effects are listed below .
the most common , probably or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in the context of the tri@@ bution were a reaction on the application location ( 22 % of treated patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
side effects resulting from 252 in placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream patients treated with acute ker@@ at@@ osis are listed below .
this according to the investig@@ ational clinical evidence showing that there was frequently diagnosed clinical trials with three @-@ week clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream frequently associated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od agents including Er@@ y@@ them ( 61 % ) , ero@@ sion ( 30 % ) , ex@@ cer@@ ation / dra@@ gons ( 23 % ) and oil ( 14 % ) ( see Section 4.4 ) .
this according to the investig@@ ational diagram showing the clinical evidence showing that there was very frequently used in these studies with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od . very frequently regarding heavy blin@@ dness ( 31 % ) , ag@@ grav@@ ated ero@@ sion ( 13 % ) , and with severe pain education ( 19 % ) .
clinical trials for the treatment of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis was found in alo@@ pe@@ dia with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment site or in the surrounding area .
the se@@ eable one @-@ time absorption of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags , could lead to nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , head@@ ache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the clin@@ ically serious side effects that occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg existed in h@@ yp@@ ot@@ onia , norm@@ alized after or@@ ally or intraven@@ ous liquid requirements .
according to the top@@ ical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , system@@ ic system@@ ic concentrations of alpha inter@@ fer@@ ons and other cy@@ to@@ k@@ ine were detected after the top@@ ical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od .
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al phase 3 efficacy studies , it could be shown that the effectiveness in relation to a full remedy during an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment is significantly higher than 16 weeks of a placebo treatment .
in 60 % of all patients with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated patients who were treated completely over ; this was 20 % of the 105 patients with placebo ( 95 % CI ) .
a full remedy could be achieved at 23 % of 157 patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , compared with 5 % of 161 treated male patients ( 95 % CI :
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od &apos;s effectiveness in five times a week for 6 weeks has been studied in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ fi@@ zi@@ elle bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
the data found out of an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study showed that about 7@@ 9.3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.9 % ) &#93; were cured from all treated patients and stayed for 48 months .
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od during a three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .

the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies in the specified dos@@ ages ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks
a minimal system@@ ic intake of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od compound due to the skin of 58 patients with ak@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis was observed during the three times weekly application during 16 weeks .
serum samples at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face of the face ( 12.5 mg , 1 bag ) and at the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the calculated half @-@ life time was about 10@@ times higher than the 2 @-@ hour half @-@ life after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in a previous study ; this indicates an extended re@@ tention of the disease in the skin .
data to system@@ ic exposure showed that the absorption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was low upon MC @-@ treated skin from patients at the age of 6 @-@ 12 years and comparable to healthy adults and adults with ak@@ tin@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ osis or super@@ flu@@ ent bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study on the rein@@ forcement tox@@ icity at the rat ( cans of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg ) , resulted in significantly reduced body weight and elevated mil@@ z weight ; a long period of four months showed no similar effects during the mouse .
a two @-@ year study on car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ icity in mice about three days per week induced no tum@@ ors at the application point .
the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od is only a small system@@ ic absorption from the human skin and not mut@@ agen@@ ic , is a risk of human beings because of the system@@ ic exposition rather low .
the tum@@ ours appeared in the group of mice , which was treated with the real @-@ free cream , formerly known as in greater number than in the control group with low U@@ VR .

in the study , mainly the safety of the pharmaceutical was investigated , however , its effectiveness was measured ( by its effect in relation to the reduction of G@@ AG concentrations in ur@@ ine and in relation to the size of the liver ) .
in children under five years , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , the G@@ AG concentrations in ur@@ ine , around 60 % , and half of the children treated a normal liver at the end of the study .
the most common adverse events of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients at the age of over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ ache , oste@@ o@@ ath@@ y ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in lim@@ bs ( in hands and feet ) , heat @-@ feeling , fever and reaction at the infusion centre .
very common adverse events in patients under five years are increased blood pressure , reduced oxygen saturation ( a measuring size of pul@@ mon@@ ary function ) , t@@ ach@@ ing@@ ing ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and sc@@ rolling frost .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be very sensitive to patients who react strongly ( allergic ) to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or one of the other components ( an@@ aph@@ yl@@ actic reaction ) .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will be updated every year to all new information , possibly known , and this summary required .
the manufacturers of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is examined patients who observe Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me as regards reactions to the in@@ fusion and development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission granted the G@@ enzyme Europe company approval for placing the market on the market of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me throughout the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a combin@@ ant shaped form of the human α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using Ch@@ o @-@ m@@ am@@ ier cell cultures ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ ops , E@@ ier@@ floor of the Chinese government ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is inde@@ xed in patients with secured diagnosis of a Mu@@ th@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ o I ( MP@@ S I , α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neurolog@@ ical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place by a physician , experience in the treatment of patients with MP@@ S I or other her@@ ed@@ al met@@ abolic diseases .
the initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient can toler@@ ate this every 15 minutes on a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and for these patients no dosing scheme can be recommended .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver in@@ suff@@ iciency is not determined , and for these patients no dosing scheme can be recommended .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may develop inf@@ usi@@ ons , defined as any related tri@@ bution , which occurs during the infusion or until the end of the infusion @-@ date ( see Section 4.8 ) .
for this reason , these patients should continue to remain tigh@@ tly super@@ bly monitored , and the infusion of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be made available in a reasonable clinical environment , where re@@ inv@@ iting facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are available immediately .
due to the clinical phase 3 study , almost all patients Ig@@ G antibodies are formed against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months of treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of inf@@ usi@@ ons , must be treated with care of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with caution ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
as little experience regarding the recovery of treatment after a longer inter@@ ruption , must be careful because of the theore@@ tically increased risk reaction according to a inter@@ ruption of treatment .
60 minutes before the beginning of the infusion with medic@@ ations ( Anti@@ hist@@ amine and / or Anti@@ py@@ an@@ ka ) to minim@@ ize the potential occurr@@ ence of inf@@ usi@@ ons .
in case of slight or moderate inf@@ usi@@ ons , treatment with Anti@@ hist@@ amine and Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered and / or a reduction in infusion rate at half of the infusion rate , in which the reaction is occurred .
in case of a single , heavy inf@@ usi@@ ons , the infusion must be stopped until the symptoms are brought to decline , a treatment with Anti@@ hist@@ amine and Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen .
infusion rate can be resum@@ ed at 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate when the response occurred .
3 ( Anti@@ hist@@ amine and Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction in infusion rate at 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate , which occurred in the past reaction .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or pro@@ c@@ ain , because a potential risk of interference with intra@@ cellular photo of Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase exists .
animal experiments did not allow direct or indirect harmful effects to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
since no data to new@@ born , which were exp@@ on@@ ated opposite Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , the breast milk is recommended , not recommended during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
the adverse reactions were entered in clinical trials which were observed in 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study included in children under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) .
un@@ desirable drugs inter@@ actions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were observed during Phase 3 , or older at a total treatment duration of up to 4 years , are often seen in the following table : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe MP@@ S @-@ I @-@ related involvement of the upper respiratory trac@@ ts and lungs in the history came out heavy reactions , including Bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ asmus , respiratory diseases and fac@@ ial ( see Section 4.4 ) .
children un@@ wanted phar@@ maceuticals in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported in a total of 20 patients with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5 , with mainly severe contamination and a duration of treatment up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
in most cases we came to a Ser@@ con@@ version within 3 months after the treatment of a serum version , whereby it was mostly seen in the patients at the age of 5 ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days at the age of 5 and older ) .
until the end of the Phase 3 study ( or up to a premature extin@@ ction from the study ) were detected at 13 / 45 patients without radio@@ immun@@ oph@@ thal@@ ate ( R@@ IP ) Ass@@ ay , mono@@ cl@@ onal antibody , including 3 patients who never came to Ser@@ o@@ con@@ version .
patients with missing to the low @-@ capital mirror , a res@@ ili@@ ent reduction in G@@ AG mir@@ r@@ els in Har@@ n , while in patients with high antibody tit@@ res was able to set a variable reduction of G@@ AG in har@@ n .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in the Phase 2 study ) showed an mar@@ g@@ inal effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic Lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ e- activity in vitro that seemed to affect the clinical efficacy and / or the reduction of G@@ AG in Har@@ n .
the presence of antibodies appeared not in connection with the incidence of un@@ wanted medicines , even when the occurr@@ ence of un@@ wanted medicines are typically involved with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reasons for the enz@@ ym@@ es of enz@@ ym@@ es is in one for the Hydro@@ ly@@ se of the Sub@@ str@@ ate Sub@@ str@@ ate and preventing a further accum@@ ulation in the en@@ act of enz@@ ym@@ es .
after intraven@@ ous infusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from the cycle and of cells into the lys@@ os@@ os@@ omes , most likely above men @-@ 6 @-@ phosphate recept@@ ors .
safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were included in a randomised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled phase 3 study in 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years .
although patients were recruited for the study , the majority of patients were treated by the mean phen@@ otype and only one patient demonstrated the heavy phen@@ otype .
patients were recruited if they had an research exp@@ ir@@ ational volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for efficacy were the percentage change of the equivalent FE@@ V and the absolute walk in the 6 @-@ minute walk .
all patients were subsequently recruited for an open label extension study , where they received another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) every week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
after 26 weeks of therapy , the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated patients to improve lung function and the ability to use in the following table .
in the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintaining this effects of up to 208 weeks in der@@ Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and of 182 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as seen from the following table .
the decrease in the percentage of the percentage of FE@@ V is not significantly significantly and the absolute lung @-@ volumes increased further propor@@ tionally in height @-@ growing children .
of the 26 patients with a h@@ ep@@ atomic norm@@ ality of treatment 22 ( 85 % ) , until the end of the study was a normal liver size .
within the first 4 weeks , a clear tr@@ ash of the G@@ AG mirror in Har@@ n ( µg / mg of cre@@ at@@ inin ) was determined , which remained constant until the end of the study .
regarding the h@@ etero@@ gen@@ eous disease mani@@ fol@@ ds among patients who summar@@ izes clin@@ ically significant changes for five efficacy variable ( 58 % ) in the 6 @-@ minute test , motion range in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deteri@@ oration of 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
an open phase 2 study was conducted in which mainly the security and pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me was studied at 20 patients , who were at the time of their recording into the study below 5 years of age ( 16 patients with severe deteri@@ oration form and 4 with the middle course form ) .
in four patients the dosing was increased to 200 E / kg for increased GA@@ G@@ - mirror in the har@@ n in the last 26 weeks .
in several patients a size increase ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) were detected after the Z @-@ score for this age group The younger patients with severe deteri@@ oration form ( &lt; 2,5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean decrease form , whereas in the older patients were only limited , or even there were no progress in cogn@@ itive development .
in a phase 4 study , investigations into the dynamic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosing schem@@ atics were carried out at the G@@ AG mirror in the har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute test test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosing scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can be able to display difficulties with weekly infusion , but it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dosing schem@@ es is equivalent to the same .

A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in ( a different medicines for cancer ) in patients who have not distur@@ bed any chemotherapy ( drugs against cancer ) , and spreads very easily on other parts of the body . • advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ small cell lung cancer , which attacks not the cell epi@@ thel@@ ial cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who have previously not been treated , in combination with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in and in patients who have previously applied other chemotherapy .
in order to reduce side effects , patients should receive a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as foli@@ c acid ( a vitamin ) and intake inj@@ ections of vitamin B12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in , should be used before or after the gift of C@@ is@@ plat@@ in additionally a &quot; Anti@@ emet@@ ikum &quot; ( drugs against vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent a fluid deficiency ) .
in patients whose blood has changed , or during which certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be reduced or reduced the dose .
the active form of p@@ emet@@ ry slow@@ s down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents cells to divide the cells .
the conversion of P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed in its active form enters the cells of lighter than in healthy cells , which leads to higher concentrations of the active form of the phar@@ maceuticals and longer active duration in cancer cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a study study on 456 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta were compared to 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease , previously treated with chemotherapy with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another phar@@ maceuticals against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( a further phar@@ maceuticals against cancer ) , both in combination with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ plat@@ in , experienced an average of 12.3 months , compared to 9.3 months during the single administration of C@@ is@@ plat@@ in .
in patients who had previously received chemotherapy alone , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta 8.3 months was compared with 7.9 months at doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
in both studies , however , patients showed the epi@@ thel@@ ial cells in which cancer was not the epi@@ thel@@ ial cells during the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta longer survival .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted to the company Eli Lil@@ ly Neder@@ land B.V. a approval for the placing of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union .
each bottle has to be dis@@ solves with 4.2 ml 0.9 % sodium chloride injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary wick is taken from circulation and diluted with 0.9 % sodium chloride injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml more ( see section 6.6 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is indicated in combination with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in to the first @-@ line therapy of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma ( see section 5.1 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA in Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with Lo@@ - K@@ al advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface area ( KO@@ F ) is administered as an intraven@@ ous infusion of 10 minutes on the first day every 21 days treatment course .
the recommended dose of C@@ is@@ plat@@ in is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as infusion over a period of 2 hours approx . 30 minutes after completion of the P@@ emet@@ rex@@ ia In@@ fusion on the first day every 21 days treatment course .
in patients with non @-@ small bronze car@@ cin@@ oma after prec@@ urs@@ or chemotherapy , the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as an intraven@@ ous infusion of 10 minutes on the first day every 21 day treatment course .
to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin actions , the day before and the day of P@@ emet@@ eries are given a cor@@ tic@@ ised ero@@ id after the treatment .
during the seven days before the first dose P@@ emet@@ eries need to be taken at least 5 doses of foli@@ c acid and intake must be continued during the entire therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last p@@ emet@@ ry dose .
patients also need to obtain an in@@ tr@@ am@@ us@@ cular injection of vitamin B12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week before the first P@@ emet@@ ry dose as well as to every third week .
in patients who received P@@ emet@@ ry , a complete bleeding should be created , including a differentiation of the leu@@ k@@ oc@@ ytes and a t@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ ten@@ te .
the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate @-@ trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Al@@ anine @-@ Trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment course , a dose test must be taking place using the N@@ adi@@ rs of blood @-@ blood or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity of the previous therapy cycles .
after the recovery , patients must be treated according to the references in Tab@@ les 1 , 2 and 3 , used for AL@@ IM@@ TA to apply as mono@@ therap@@ ies or in combination with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ icity Crit@@ eria ( C@@ TC 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 blood .
should patients not develop @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ≥ Grade 3 ( except ne@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with AL@@ IM@@ TA until the patient must decrease the value before treatment .
treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be canc@@ eled when patients after 2 doses of hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity degree 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - at the appearance of grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
clinical studies shows no indication that in patients at the age of 65 years or over , in comparison to patients aged 65 years , an increased risk of increased risks .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to non @-@ sufficient data for in@@ fertil@@ ity and effectiveness .
clinical trials were not necessary in patients with a cre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min does not need dose adjustments required for all patients with recommended dose adjustment .
the data base in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine cle@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver restriction of &gt; the 1.5 times of the upper Bil@@ ir@@ ub@@ in@@ - limit value and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; 3 times the upper limit value ( for det@@ ecting liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 times of the upper limit values ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) is not especially studied in the studies .
patients need to be monitored in patients with regard to the bone mark@@ er and p@@ emet@@ ry may not be given to patients before their absolute neut@@ rop@@ hil@@ ation count again reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the t@@ rom@@ bo@@ - cy@@ te count once again reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adir of absolute neut@@ rop@@ hil@@ d count and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity , as they were observed in the previous treatment cycles - see section 4.2 ) .
a lower tox@@ icity and a reduction of degrees 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and ni@@ ch@@ th@@ ological tox@@ icity , such as Neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie , f@@ eb@@ r@@ ile Neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie and infection with degree 3 / 4 Neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie was administered if a pre @-@ treatment with foli@@ c acid and vitamin B12 was taken .
therefore , all patients treated with P@@ emet@@ ized patients are required to apply foli@@ c acid and vitamin B12 as a proph@@ y@@ - l@@ act@@ ate measure to treat tox@@ icity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s ) such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ s@@ ali@@ - c@@ yl@@ acid ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) must be avoided for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and minim@@ alism ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients who are provided for a therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed is necessary to avoid N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long half @-@ life for at least 5 days prior to the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ emet@@ er@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients who occurred these events , had the corresponding risk factors for the occurr@@ ence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , existing blu@@ epr@@ int or diabetes .
therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant liquid man@@ age@@ - collection in trans@@ cellular room a dra@@ ining of the ergonom@@ ics of the p@@ emet@@ ry treatment should be considered .
5 serious cardiovascular events , including my@@ oc@@ ardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events were reported in clinical trials with p@@ emet@@ eries occasionally , when this drug was usually administered in combination with another Cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance .
for this reason , the simultaneous use of atten@@ u@@ ed living dim@@ mer ( except yel@@ low@@ e@@ ber , these vacc@@ ination is not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of an ir@@ reversible shepherd of re@@ productive capacity should be noted before treatment - G@@ inn should be advised to obtain advice regarding the sperm cells .
in patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses of non @-@ ster@@ oid anti@@ ph@@ ic acid ( ≥ 1,3 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ icy@@ lic acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1,3 g per day ) to a reduced P@@ emet@@ ry curing with a consequence of a greater rise of side effects .
therefore caution is careful when patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ icy@@ lic acid in high dosage .
I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ - acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy , the day of therapy and minim@@ alism ( see section 4.4 ) .
since there are no data regarding the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long half @-@ life such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous use of P@@ emet@@ ry should be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ - xed .
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the transmission status during the disease and the possibility of inter@@ actions between oral antibodies and ant@@ ine@@ oplast@@ ic chemotherapy requires an increased surveillance frequency of IN@@ R ( International norm@@ alised ratio ) when the decision was taken to treat patients with or@@ ical antibodies .
there are no data for the use of P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed at pregnant while , but as with an@@ de@@ - anti@@ metabol@@ ites are expected in pregnancy .
P@@ emet@@ re@@ bo@@ xed should not be applied during pregnancy , except if necessary , and after careful separation of the use@@ fulness for the mother and risk for the F@@ öt@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of an ir@@ reversible damage to re@@ productive capacity should be referred by P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised before the treatment course , advice regarding the sperm count .
it is not known whether P@@ emet@@ ry mixed in breast milk and un@@ desirable effects can not be excluded .

the primary analysis of this study was performed in the population of all patients who received test medication in the treatment arm ( random@@ ized and treated ) .
statistically significant improvement in clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ no@@ e ) in connection with mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ om was shown in the AL@@ IM@@ TA / C@@ is@@ plat@@ in @-@ arm ( 212 patients ) opposite the sole C@@ is@@ pla@@ - tin arm ( 218 patients ) .
the differences between the two treatment arms are caused by improving the pul@@ mon@@ ary parameters in the AL@@ IM@@ TA / C@@ is@@ plat@@ in @-@ arm and a deteri@@ oration of lung function during the time in the controller .
a multic@@ entr@@ e , randomised , open phase III study with AL@@ IM@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSC@@ LC after previous chemotherapy was diagnosed with AL@@ IM@@ TA ( Int@@ ent to Tre@@ at Population n = 283 ) and of 7.9 months with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el treated patients ( ITT n = 288 ) .

limited data of a separately randomised , controlled phase 3 study demonstrate that efficacy data ( survival and progression free survival ) for p@@ emet@@ ry between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) are similar to doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
the efficacy analysis of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analyses of the ITT population and support the non @-@ loss of AL@@ IM@@ TA C@@ is@@ plat@@ in combination compared to gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine C@@ is@@ plat@@ in combination .

Alo@@ xi is used for chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ies that are strong trig@@ gers for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( such as C@@ is@@ plat@@ in ) , as well as chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ies , the moderate trig@@ gers for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting are ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or car@@ b@@ op@@ lat@@ in ) .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the additional gift of a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medic@@ inal that can be used as anti @-@ emet@@ ry ) .
the application for patients under 18 years of age is not recommended since the effects in this age group do not lie enough information .
this means that the active ingredient produces the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amine ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in ) , on the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ine .
Alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies at 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chemotherapy , strong or moderate trig@@ gers for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting .
for chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ies , the strong trig@@ gers for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting are , 59 % of the patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi were no vom@@ iting ( 132 from 223 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron patients ( 126 from 221 ) .
for chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ies , the moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi were not getting a vom@@ iting ( 153 of 189 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron patients ( 127 from 185 ) .
with a comparison of Dol@@ ass@@ et@@ ron these values are 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission granted the Helsinki Bi@@ rex Pharmaceuticals company , a approval for the placing of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union .
Alo@@ xi is inde@@ xed : for prevention of acute nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting for strongly em@@ eto@@ ed chemotherapy due to cancer prevention and prevention of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting for moderate chemotherapy due to cancer disease .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi to prevention of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , which is induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ gen@@ ic chemotherapy , can be strengthened by adding one before the given Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the col@@ on passage , patients should be monitored with am@@ nesty observ@@ ations or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us after injection of tigh@@ tening .
as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 ant@@ agon@@ ists , however , it is careful to extend the same gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which the Q@@ T interval is extended or extending to such an extension .
except in connection with any other chem@@ o@@ therapeu@@ tics , Alo@@ xi is neither pre@@ vent@@ ured nor used for the treatment of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting in the days after chemotherapy .
in pre@@ clinical trials , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron is not in@@ hib@@ ited against tum@@ ours of five examined chem@@ o@@ therapeu@@ tics ( C@@ is@@ plat@@ in , Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , Cy@@ clo@@ ab@@ ine , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ yc@@ in C ) .
in a clinical study , no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ical interaction between one @-@ time intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady @-@ static concentration of Met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ am@@ ids , of a CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors .
in one of a population @-@ based pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ical analysis revealed that the simultaneous gift of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 In@@ hibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on , C@@ elec@@ trop@@ y , Sc@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , Sc@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , Ser@@ tr@@ al@@ in and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant impact on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experiences for the application of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ an@@ cies are not before , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be applied for pregnant women , unless it is necessary to treat the doctor as necessary .
clinical trials were the most common with a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) which stood at least with alo@@ xi in connection , head@@ ache ( 9 % ) and Ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of surplus relation reactions and reactions to the appoint@@ ments ( burning , har@@ dening , complaints and pain ) were reported in post marketing experiences .
in the group with the highest dosage , similar measures showed un@@ desirable events such as in the other dos@@ sier ; there were no dose to be observed .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were performed , however , due to the large distribution volume , a di@@ aly@@ sis probably does not have any effective therapy with a Alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dosage .
in two randomised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients were compared with ≤ 50 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic patients ( half @-@ time 4 hours ) or 100 mg of Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ time : 7.3 hours ) , which was given to Day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ ian IV .
in a randomised double @-@ blind study , 667 patients who received a strongly em@@ eto@@ gen@@ ic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ b@@ az@@ ine and 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron received patients who received 32 mg On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron based on Day 1 .
results of studies with moderate @-@ based chemotherapy and the study with strongly em@@ eto@@ ed chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables .
in clinical trials for indication of chemotherapy induced nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the corresponding effects of On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
according to the findings of clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron possesses the ability to block the I@@ on@@ ite &apos;s vent@@ ri@@ cular de@@ ar@@ isation and to extend the duration of the action potential .
the objective of the study carried out in 221 healthy volunteers the evaluation of the EK@@ G @-@ effects of i.@@ V. was administered by the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.25 , 0.75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
Res@@ or@@ ption After intraven@@ ous gift follow an initial decrease of plasma concentrations as a slow Eli@@ mination of the body with an average terminal block of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area under the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ately in the entire dose area of 0,@@ 3- 90 μ g / kg .
after an intraven@@ ous gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses between day 1 and day 5 measured medium ( ± SD ) increase in the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration at 42 ± 34 % .
from pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ical simul@@ ations that the peak was comparable with a daily intraven@@ ous gift of 0.25 mg of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in 3 consecutive days ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) comparable to after one @-@ time intraven@@ ous administration of 0.75 mg ; however , the C@@ max was higher than 0.75 mg higher .
about 40 % will eliminate the kidneys and approximately 50 % are converted into two primary Met@@ abol@@ ism , which compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in less than 1 % of the ant@@ agon@@ ist effect on 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
in @-@ vitro studies on met@@ abolic patients showed that CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 has been involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elim@@ ination After a IV single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , about 80 % of the dose were found within 144 hours of ur@@ ine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron made as an un@@ altered active ingredient , made approximately 40 % of the given dose .
after one @-@ time intraven@@ ous bol@@ ster problem in healthy life was 173 ± 73 ml / min and ren@@ al cle@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
although in patients with severe liver function , the terminal elim@@ ination system and the average system@@ ic exposure with Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron increases , a reduction of the dose is not justified .
in pre @-@ clinical trials , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions that are considered adequate over the maximum human therapeutic exposition which indicates a slight relev@@ ance for clinical use .
10 Out of clinical trials prove that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can block only in very high concentrations of I@@ onic channels , which can extend to the vent@@ ri@@ cular de@@ ar@@ isation and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation .
high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded to approximately 30 times of therapeutic exposure to humans ) , which were given daily over two years , resulted in a higher frequency of liver tum@@ ors , en@@ doc@@ rine Ne@@ op@@ las@@ ms ( in thy@@ ro@@ id , p@@ itu@@ itary , pan@@ cre@@ as , side @-@ ni@@ er@@ en@@ mark ) and skin tum@@ ors , but not in mice .
the under@@ lying mechanisms are not fully known , but because of the used high doses and Alo@@ xi is determined for one @-@ time use , the relev@@ ance of these results will be minimal for humans .

June 2006 , the Committee for Human Medicine Act ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative survey on the basis of authorisation for the treatment of hepatitis C for the treatment of hepatitis C approved by Alph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution .
this means that Alph@@ eon is an organic drug called Ro@@ feron @-@ A , which is similar to use in the EU , which is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; Reference Service &quot; ) .
Alph@@ eon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long lasting ) Hepatitis C ( one of the liver disease ) .
in a micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic investigation , the liver tissue damage to the liver , the values of the liver cells Al@@ an@@ in@@ - amin@@ ot@@ rans@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are increased in blood .
it is produced by an yeast into which a gene ( DNA ) is applied to the formation of active ingredients .
the manufacturer of Alph@@ eon presented data presented to the comparison of Alph@@ eon with Ro@@ feron @-@ A ( active structure , composition and purity of the drugs , efficiency , safety and efficacy at hepatitis C ) .
patients with hepatitis C was compared with the efficacy of Alph@@ eon with the effectiveness of reference to 455 patients .
in the study was measured as many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after adjusting the treatment to the drug ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .

EMEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distri@@ butions of this document is said to have the importance given to the CH@@ MP recommendation for dispatch on the market .
furthermore , concerns expressed , the data on the stability of the substances and of the medication could not be sufficient .
the number of patients with hepatitis C based on the treatment with Alph@@ eon and Ro@@ feron @-@ A were similar in clinical study .
after adjusting the treatment with Alph@@ eon the disease was flamm@@ able in more patients than with the reference conditions ; Alph@@ eon had more adverse reactions .
in addition , the test carried out in the study carried out a immune response in the study ( i.e. the body makes antibodies - special proteins - against the phar@@ maceuticals ) not suff@@ ici@@ ently vali@@ dated .
it may be applied for the treatment of Im@@ pet@@ igo ( a cr@@ ust @-@ her@@ met@@ ic skin infection ) and small in@@ classified Laz@@ er@@ ations ( R@@ iss@@ or / ker@@ e@@ wounds ) , de@@ pl@@ ying and bent wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go is not used to treat infections , which have been proven or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ c@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( M@@ RSA ) , because the alarm against this type of infections may not work .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years the surface must not exceed 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient does not respond to treatment two to three days , the doctor should investigate the patients again and consider alternative treatments .
it works through block of bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of bacter@@ i@@ enz@@ elle , in which proteins are produced ) and in@@ hib@@ its the growth of bacteria .
primary indi@@ ces of efficacy was in all five studies in the proportion of patients whose infection was eff@@ ected according to the end of treatment .
according to 119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of the 139 patients under al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of the 71 patients in placebo had the treatment .
in the treatment of infected skin @-@ wounds , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in similar response rates : if the results were taken together with skin wounds , about 90 % of patients both groups were treated to treatment .
however , in these two studies , however , Al@@ tar@@ go was diagnosed in the treatment of wast@@ ew@@ ays ( eit@@ fully filled cav@@ ities in the body tissue ) or of infections , which were det@@ ectable or probably by M@@ RSA , is not effective enough .
the most common side effect with alt@@ ar@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a coefficient of friction on the order .
at the conclusion that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go reached in the short @-@ time treatment of the following su@@ perf@@ icial skin infections against the risks : • Im@@ pet@@ igo , the infected small in@@ fir@@ ations , di@@ ced or inclined wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission granted the Gla@@ xo Group Ltd . a approval for the placing of Al@@ tar@@ go throughout the European Union .
patients with which no improvements should be considered within two to three days , should be considered once and an alternative therapy can be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
in the case of a Sen@@ si@@ zing or severe local Ir@@ rit@@ ation by the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be , the treatment is broken carefully and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection are started .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be applied to the treatment of infections with which M@@ RSA is known as a path@@ ogen , or assumed ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in clinical studies with secondary @-@ infected wounds the efficacy of retin@@ am@@ ulin was induced into patients with infections which caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ c@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( M@@ RSA ) , in@@ sufficient .
an alternative therapy is considered to be considered if after a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment , no improvement or deteri@@ oration of the infected place will occur .
the effect of simultaneous use of retin@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical means on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous use of other top@@ ical medicines will not be recommended .
due to its small plasma concentration , which were achieved by human skin or infected su@@ perf@@ icial skin , clin@@ ically relevant inhibit@@ ors can not be expected in vivo ( see section 5.2 ) .
3 After the simultaneous gift of 2 times a day 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol increased the medium ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max according to top@@ ographic application of 1 % retin@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be on a sh@@ ielded skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to its low system@@ ic exposure to patients , dose custom@@ iz@@ ations are not required for being used when top@@ ical retin@@ am@@ ulin is applied during a system@@ ic treatment with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ hibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a re@@ productive elast@@ icity after oral dosing and are in@@ adequate in terms of consequences for the birth and red@@ dish / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should be applied during pregnancy when a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly inde@@ xed and applying the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is the gift of an system@@ ic anti@@ bi@@ otic .
in case of decision whether the breast@@ feeding is continued / termin@@ ate or the therapy with the Al@@ tar@@ go continued to be completed between the benefit of the breast@@ feeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
in clinical studies of 2@@ 150 patients with su@@ perf@@ icial skin infections , the Al@@ tar@@ go had applied , the most frequently reported side effects of Ir@@ rit@@ ation on the administration location which looked about 1 % of the patients .
action method Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ rom@@ util@@ in , a substance that is isolated by fermentation of Cl@@ it@@ op@@ ilus pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pas@@ se@@ ag@@ anus ) .
the action mechanism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective inhibit@@ ors of bacterial proteins through interaction in a specific binding point of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ om , which diff@@ ers from the binding of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al anti@@ bacterial substances .
data refer to that the Bin@@ der stelle ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales protein L3 is involved in the region of ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binder and the pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ral centre .
using engagement to this binding point , P@@ leu@@ rom@@ util@@ ine in@@ hibit the pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transfer , partial P @-@ binder and prevent the normal education of active 50s bos@@ om@@ aler sub@@ units .
should the basis of the local prevalence of resistance to the use of retin@@ am@@ ulin should appear at least some inf@@ ectiv@@ ity forms , an advice should be infected by experts .
there were no differences in in @-@ vitro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were resistant or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in the case of non @-@ appe@@ aling on treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
Res@@ or@@ ption in a study with healthy adults was raised 1 % retin@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be per day under oc@@ clu@@ sion and applied to the skin for up to 7 days .
in 516 patients ( adults and children ) , 1 % retin@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be received twice daily for 5 days for the top@@ ical treatment of secondary wounds , single plasma screens have been gained .
the samples took place on days 3 or 4 in adult patients before the medication and the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual system@@ ic absorption of people after top@@ ical use of 1 % sal@@ be on 200 cm2 ( pH = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 ng · h / ml ) 660 times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP shirts .

Ambi@@ rix becomes a protection against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B ( diseases , which affect the liver ) in children aged between one and 15 years , who are not immune to these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is applied in the framework of one out of two doses existing vacc@@ ination , whereby the protection against hepatitis B may not be reached after administration of the second dose .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used when immune response is a lower risk of hepatitis B infection and ensured that the vacc@@ ination of two doses can be brought to an end .
if a loading dose of hepatitis A or B is preferred , Ambi@@ rix or another hepatitis A or B vaccine will be given .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vacc@@ ines work with the immune system ( the natural defense of the body ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how it can defend against a disease . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after having received a vaccine , the immune system det@@ ects viruses and surface anti@@ gens than &quot; strange &quot; and creates antibodies against it .
Ambi@@ rix contains the same components as the vacc@@ ination of the Twin@@ rix Children permitted since 1996 and has been permitted since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect the same diseases , however , Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are given as part of a three doses existing in three doses .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ults contain identical ingredients , some of the data , which support the application of Twin@@ rix adults , also used as a cover for the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indi@@ ces for efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children that had been developed a month after the last inj@@ ections had developed a protective antibodies .
in an additional study with 208 children , the vacc@@ ination of vacc@@ ines was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 month gap between the two inj@@ ections .
between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children a month after the last injection into the development of protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of the protection of Ambi@@ rix was in a six @-@ month long distance between the inj@@ ections .
the most common adverse events of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vacc@@ ination boxes ) are head@@ aches , appet@@ ite , pain on the injection of injection , mixing , har@@ ness ( ti@@ red@@ ness ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix may in patients who may over@@ flow ( allergic ) to the active substances , one of the other components or ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( an anti@@ bi@@ otic ) should not be applied .
in August 2002 the European Commission granted the company Gla@@ x@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ olog@@ etic s.@@ a. a approval for the placing of Ambi@@ rix in the entire
the stand di@@ version for the Grun@@ dig mun@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ inations , with the first dose of the choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose .
when a collecting vacc@@ ination is required for hepatitis B and hepatitis B , it can be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or combined with a combination sim@@ pler .
the anti @-@ hepatitis B virus ( anti @-@ H@@ bs@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ bs@@ A@@ g ) - and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ bs@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ bs@@ A@@ g ) occur in the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not yet completely secured whether immune competent people , which need to be vacc@@ ination on a Hepatitis A vaccine , as it may also be protected by the immune memory by the immune memory .
3 As with all inj@@ uri@@ ous agents should be available immediately for the rare fall of an an@@ aph@@ yl@@ actic reaction according to the gift of vacc@@ ination , appropriate possibilities for medical treatment and monitoring always available immediately .
if a fast protection against hepatitis B is necessary , the Stand@@ ar@@ dim@@ mer scheme is recommended that the 360 ELISA units formal@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen contains .
in case of hem@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with dis@@ rup@@ tions of the immune system , no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies are achieved , so that in these cases other vaccine doses may be required .
since there may result intra@@ ocular injection or in@@ tr@@ am@@ us@@ cular administration in the glut@@ eal muscles to be avoided , these inj@@ ections should be avoided .
in these cases it can be inj@@ ected at Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ g@@ open@@ ia or bleeding problems because it may occur in these cases after in@@ tr@@ am@@ us@@ cular gifts .
if Ambi@@ rix was administered in the form of a separate injection , tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , az@@ ep@@ oph@@ ilus influenza type b @-@ vaccine ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with a combined mas@@ ern@@ - m@@ um@@ ps vaccine was administered , the immune response was suff@@ ici@@ ently sufficient ( see section 5.1 ) .
patients suffering from immun@@ opath@@ ic therapy or in patients with immune defects must be assumed that requires no adequate immune response .
in a clinical study carried out with 3 vacc@@ inations of these formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , ros@@ ci@@ dity , s@@ ability , gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ itis , head@@ ache and fever comparable with frequency that was observed in earlier Thi@@ omer@@ sal@@ - and preserv@@ ative vaccine formulation .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vaccine doses were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 Imp@@ air@@ ings at the age of 1 and including 15 years .
in a study of 300 participants at the age of 12 to and including 15 years , the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix was compared with the 3 @-@ inch combination sim@@ pler .
the only exceptions was the higher Frequ@@ encies of pain and mat@@ ory at a calculation basis for the vacc@@ ination of a vacc@@ ination . ( not based on a calculation basis per person ) .
pain was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 0.7 % of the subjects , compared with 3@@ 9.1 % of the subjects after the gift of a dose of 3 doses .
according to the complete vacc@@ ination cycle reported 6@@ 6,4 % of the subjects who had been given a loss of pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % of the subjects who have been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ c@@ en- .
however , the frequency of mat@@ ory was comparable to high ( i.e. about the entire vacc@@ ination cycle at 3@@ 9.6 % of the subjects who received Ambi@@ rix , compared with 3@@ 6.2 % in the subjects who received the 3 doses combined use ) .
the frequency of pregn@@ ated pain and mat@@ ory was low and comparable to the administration of the combination @-@ sim@@ pler with the 3 @-@ cans oc@@ in@@ scheme .
in a comparative study with 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ old Imp@@ air@@ ingen the occurr@@ ence of local inter@@ actions and general inter@@ actions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ group comparable with the 3 @-@ cans investig@@ ational hepatitis A virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
however , during the 6- to 11@@ - year old , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix a common frequency of pain ( on injection ) per dose , not per pro@@ filing , reported .
the share of Imp@@ air@@ ingen , which consisted of severe adverse events during the 2 @-@ cans vaccine schem@@ as with the combination sim@@ pler with 360 EL@@ ISA@@ - units formal@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface , statistically was not different .
in clinical trials that were conducted at Imp@@ air@@ y at the age of 1 and including 15 years , the serum rates for anti @-@ H@@ AV 9@@ 9.1 % had a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to the month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the serum rates for anti @-@ H@@ BS were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to the month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study that was conducted at 12- and including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 received two doses . Ambi@@ rix and 147 the standard combin@@ ant with three doses .
in the 289 persons whose immun@@ ity was evaluated ( SP in the table below ) against hepatitis B in the table below ) against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 were significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix .
the immune response , which was achieved in a clinical study on 1 @-@ 11 @-@ year @-@ old one month after the completion of the full vacc@@ inations ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies the Imp@@ air@@ ings were either a 2 @-@ inch vaccine scheme with a combination of 360 ELISA units with a combination sim@@ pler with 360 ELISA units form@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µg re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in people who were at the time of the ground dim@@ ization between 12 and 15 years old , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies could be detected at least 24 months after immun@@ isation using the Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 @-@ month vaccine .
the immune reaction against both anti@@ gens was comparable against both anti@@ gens that was diagnosed after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination sim@@ pler , consisting of 360 ELISA units form@@ in@@ activated H@@ epat@@ it@@ is@@ - A @-@ virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study with 12- to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies are comparable 24 months after immun@@ isation in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transferred by vir@@ al contamination food and beverages , but can also be transferred by other way as through Baden in due to water puri@@ fication .
you can feel very tired , have a dark ur@@ ine , a bright face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( yel@@ low@@ eth ) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix is not fully protect against infection with hepatitis A or Hepatitis B virus , even when the complete vacc@@ ination series was completed with 2 doses .
if you have infected / your child before the administration of both vacc@@ inations Ambi@@ rix already infected with hepatitis A or Hepatitis B virus ( although you / your child will not feel un@@ likely or feel sick or feel sick of the vacc@@ ination ) may not prevent infection .
a protection against other infections , which cause the liver damage or symptoms which are similar to those of hepatitis A or Hepatitis B infection , cannot be medi@@ ated .
• When your child has become an allergic reaction at Ambi@@ rix or any component of this vaccine , including Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( an anti@@ bi@@ otic ) .
an allergic reaction can express itself by ju@@ ck@@ ling skin advice , breathing and sw@@ elling of the face or tongue . • When you have occurred an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B . • When you have a severe infection with fever .
• If you want to have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and prior to the provided administration of the second vacc@@ ination ) .
at a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will give you / your child from vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , he will advise you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis A / Hepatitis B vacc@@ ines with a reduced content of effective hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface anti@@ gens ) .
the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vaccine is usually administered by one month after the first dose , and should give you an vacc@@ ination protection before the vaccine series .
sometimes , Ambi@@ rix is inj@@ ected in people suffering from severe bleeding problems , if you are weak@@ ened under the skin and not in the muscle if your child is weak@@ ened or if you / your child is under@@ gone or under@@ go any hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis .
Ambi@@ rix can be given in these inst@@ ances , but the immune response of these individuals can not be sufficient for vacc@@ ination , so that a blood test can be required to see how strongly the reaction is needed .
21 Do you receive your doctor if you receive / your child another medicine ( including those who have been vacc@@ inated without ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ation ) or if you have been vacc@@ inated or Immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ine ( antibodies ) have been given or so in the near future is planned .
however , it may be that in this case the immune response is not sufficient for the vaccine and is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine is associated with Ambi@@ rix , it should be vacc@@ inated with separate digits and possible different lim@@ bs .
if Ambi@@ rix is given at the same time or shortly before or after injection of Immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the response to the vaccine is still sufficient .
usually Ambi@@ rix pregnant or l@@ act@@ ating women are not administered , except it is ur@@ gently required that they are vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A as well as hepatitis B .
important information about certain other materials of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have demonstrated an allergic reaction on Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( anti@@ bi@@ otic ) once upon you / your child .
if you miss the agreed date for the second vaccine , please contact your doctor and make a new date as soon as possible .

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
based on the data that has become known since issu@@ ance of the first authorization for the placing on the market , CH@@ MP grants the view that the benefit @-@ risk relationship for Ambi@@ rix remains positive .
however , only in one member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) the available safety data for this medicine is limited because of the small patient exposition .
Ammon@@ ite can also be used in patients at the age of over one month with in@@ sof@@ ter En@@ z@@ ym@@ ine or with hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ic endo@@ thel@@ ial disorders ( due to high am@@ mon@@ ium concentration ) in the front history .
Ammon@@ ite is divided - split up to several single doses - swal@@ lowed , mixed with food or via a Gast@@ os@@ om@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ n ( due to the pan@@ ic in the stomach ( leading hose ) or a mu@@ c@@ onde ( due to the nose in the stomach @-@ leading hose ) .
there were no comparative study , there were not able to compare with another treatment or placebo ( a placebo @-@ medicine , i.e. no drug ) .
Ammon@@ aps may also lead to appet@@ ite , mal@@ ign@@ ity , head@@ ache , nau@@ sea , nau@@ sea , nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , nau@@ sea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , r@@ p@@ age@@ ous body od@@ or or weight gain .
the Committee for Human Medicine Act ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that am@@ aps in patients with dis@@ rup@@ tions of the urea cycle can be effective to high am@@ mon@@ ium values .
Ammon@@ aps was approved under &quot; extraordinary circumstances , since due to the rarity of the disease at the time of admission only limited information to this drug .
the use is inde@@ xed in all patients with a complete En@@ z@@ om@@ gel already manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days ) .
in patients with a late @-@ mani@@ fold form ( in@@ sof@@ tening en@@ def@@ ective , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first lifetime ) there is an indication for use if the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis exists a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ic En@@ cep@@ halopath@@ y .
for infants , suitable for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with stro@@ kes , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form .
the daily dose is individually charged with consideration of the protein tolerance and the necessary daily protein intake of the patients .
after previous clinical experience the normal daily dose of sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg and with Her@@ an@@ growing and adults .
in patients who suffer from an early @-@ manipul@@ ative lack of car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ amide or Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ tran@@ ss@@ ou@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase , the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ qu@@ lin or arg@@ in@@ ine is required in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
patients with a arg@@ in@@ in@@ os@@ yn@@ thesis deficiency must be arg@@ in@@ ine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients with s@@ u@@ ck@@ dysfunction , as a risk for the emergence of Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ ul@@ cer@@ a , if the tablets do not reach immediately in the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mol ) sodium , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) sodium per 20 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used with con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure or severe cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency as well as to be used with sodium re@@ mun@@ eration and ec@@ ology formation only with caution .
since Met@@ abol@@ isation and differentiation of sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat above the liver and the kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used with liver or kidney failure only with extreme caution .
the importance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore con@@ tra @-@ inde@@ xed ( see 4.3 ) .
the sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate in young rats in a high dosage ( 190 - 474 mg / kg ) came to a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal deteri@@ oration and a reduced loss of neur@@ ons .
there was also a delayed matur@@ ation of cer@@ eb@@ r@@ als syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functional nerv@@ es in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be noted whether phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate ex@@ cre@@ ted to people in breast milk , and this reason is the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during the breast@@ feeding time ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , at least 56 % of patients at least one un@@ wanted event ( AE ) , and 78 % of these un@@ wanted events were assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old ano@@ re@@ ct@@ ic patient who developed a met@@ abolic En@@ cep@@ halopath@@ y , heavy hypo@@ thesis , ar@@ mor@@ yt@@ open@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ y and pan@@ cre@@ at@@ itis .
a case of an over@@ dose occurred in a 5 @-@ month @-@ old small child with an acci@@ dentally single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms come with the accum@@ ulation of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate , which showed an intraven@@ ous administration of up to 400 mg / kg / day a dos@@ is@@ lim@@ iter tox@@ icity .
phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate is a met@@ abolic active link which is con@@ founded by acet@@ ylene by glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which di@@ vor@@ ced over the kidneys .
St@@ ö@@ chi@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally viewed with urea similar ( both connections contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carriers to distingu@@ ish excess nitrogen .
5 patients with dis@@ rup@@ tions of the ur@@ inary tract can be accepted that for each gram , mon@@ os@@ poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat can be produced between 0.12 and 0.15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is of importance that the diagnosis is early and the treatment started immediately to improve survival @-@ chances and clinical outcome .
the progn@@ osis of the early @-@ manipul@@ ated shape of the disease with the onset of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was earlier almost always inf@@ ecting and the disease led even in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids , or with their st@@ ick@@ ness free analogue in the first life of life .
by hem@@ aly@@ sis , the utilization of alternative means of nit@@ ric separation ( sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium poly@@ pro@@ stitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate at post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first lifetime ) diagnostic diseases to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy and the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients it came with time for many of mental disabilities or other neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its .
in patients with a late @-@ mani@@ fold form of the disease ( including female patients with h@@ etero@@ zy@@ g@@ otes form of the Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ tran@@ ss@@ ou@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase deficiency ) , which were treated from hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ary endo@@ thel@@ ial rate and after a prot@@ ein@@ ed diet was treated to the survival rate of 98 % .
already existing neu@@ rolo@@ gic defic@@ its are hardly reversible and in some cases a further deteri@@ oration of the Neu@@ rolog@@ ical State may occur .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate oxi@@ des to phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate oxi@@ des , which is con@@ founded in liver and kidney enz@@ ym@@ atic with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and ur@@ ine were determined after a single dose of 5 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in so@@ ber , hem@@ og@@ lob@@ b@@ arian changes and liver cir@@ rh@@ osis according to individual and repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled studies ) .
the behavior of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabolism was also examined in case of cancer patients after an intraven@@ ous gift of sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in tablet form , 15 minutes after the intake of the plasma concentration of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were detected .
in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary cycles or hem@@ ost@@ or@@ opath@@ ic patients , according to different doses of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) in the next morning , no phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate in plasma were det@@ ectable in plasma .
three of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , which were treated with sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) were treated with the average phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentration on the third day five times higher than after the first gifts .
the drug is ex@@ pressing the kidneys within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ jug@@ ated product of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine via the kidneys .
according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in the toxic and non @-@ toxic cans treated no kl@@ ast@@ ogenic effects ( examination 24 and 48 h after oral dosing of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 2800 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules is taken either or@@ ally ( infants and children who can &apos;t swal@@ low any tablets , or patients with s@@ u@@ ck@@ ic disorders ) or via a Gast@@ os@@ om@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ et or a Nas@@ en@@ onde .
after previous clinical experience the normal daily dose sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg and with Her@@ an@@ growing and adults .
concentration of ammonia , arg@@ in@@ ine , essential amino acids ( in particular bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um proteins should be kept within the normal range .
in patients who suffer from an early @-@ manipul@@ ative lack of car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ amide or Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ tran@@ ss@@ ou@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase , the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ qu@@ lin or arg@@ in@@ ine is required in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5,4 m@@ mol ) sodium per gram of sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) sodium per 20 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when R@@ atten@@ d@@ les were exposed to the birth of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate ( active Met@@ al@@ ms of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) , it came to les@@ ions in the pyramid of cran@@ ial cells .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old ano@@ re@@ ct@@ ic patient who developed a met@@ abolic En@@ cep@@ halopath@@ y , heavy hypo@@ thesis , ar@@ mor@@ yt@@ open@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ y and pan@@ cre@@ at@@ itis .
St@@ ö@@ chi@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally viewed with urea comparable ( both connections contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carriers to distingu@@ ish excess
based on investigations via the differentiation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with dis@@ rup@@ tions of the ur@@ inary cycle can be assumed to produce sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat between 0.12 and 0.15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
already existing neu@@ rolo@@ gic defic@@ its are hardly reversible in treatment , and in some cases a further deteri@@ oration of the Neu@@ rolog@@ ical State may occur .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form , 15 minutes after the intake of the plasma concentration of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were detected .
during the duration of durability , the patient can store the ready product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C .
in this case , the small measuring spoon contains 0.@@ 95 g , the medium measuring spoon 2,9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.6 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat .
if a patient needs to receive a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS must be dis@@ band@@ ed before use in water ( the sol@@ u@@ bility of sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is up to 5 grams in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rar@@ ities , certain liver enz@@ ym@@ es are missing , so that they can do the st@@ ick@@ ness waste products that could not differ for protein in the body .
when studying laboratory studies , you need to inform the doctor that you take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat can affect the results of certain laboratory studies .
when taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other drugs or recently taken , even if it is not pres@@ cription drug .
during the breast@@ feeding time , you should not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS because the medicine can over@@ walk in the breast milk and damage your baby .
in rare cases , confusion , head@@ ache , taste problems , ob@@ struction of the ear , disin@@ teg@@ ration , memory disorders and a deteri@@ oration of existing neu@@ rolo@@ gic condition were observed .
if you determine one of these symptoms , you instantly use your doctor or with the Not@@ ion of your hospital for the introduction of a corresponding treatment in connection .
if you forget your AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS intake , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .

in the treatment of ACS was an@@ gi@@ ox - with or without a gift of G@@ PI - at the prevention of new events ( deaths , heart attacks or Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation ) after 30 days or a year in the same as conventional treatment .
in patients receiving a PCI , angi@@ ox was the same as effective as H@@ ep@@ arin , except for heavy bleeding , with which it was significantly more effective than H@@ ep@@ arin .
an@@ gi@@ ox may not be applied to patients who may be sensitive to be@@ ating ( allergic ) against bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine , other mil@@ ud@@ ine or one of the other components .
it must not be used in patients who had a blood of blood , as well as people with strong hyper@@ tension or heavy kidney problems or a heart infection .
the Committee for Human Medicine Act ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that An@@ gi@@ ox is a replacement for H@@ ep@@ arin &apos;s treatment during the treatment of ACS and a PCI .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to the Company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd . approval for the placing on the market by An@@ gi@@ ox in the entire European Union .
to treat adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ or syn@@ dro@@ men ( inst@@ ab@@ ile ang@@ ina / non @-@ spray guns ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) in an emergency case , or if an early intervention is planned .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intraven@@ ous pin of 0.1 mg / kg , followed by a infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h .
if one PCI is performed in other consecutive sequence , an additional Bol@@ us of 0.5 mg / kg should be increased and the infusion for the duration of the intervention is increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
according to clinical requirements , the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours will be resum@@ ed .
immediately before the procedure , a gradient of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered , followed by a infusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure .
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous set of 0.75 mg / kg of body weight and one of them immediately followed by intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous infusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of intervention .
the safety and efficacy of an all@@ certain Bol@@ us gift of An@@ gi@@ ox was not investigated and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned .
if this value is shortened ( ACT after 5 minutes ) to less than 225 seconds , a second bol@@ ster amount should be 0.3 mg / kg / body weight .
in order to reduce the occurr@@ ence of low ACT values , the re@@ constituted and diluted medic@@ inal products should be carefully mixed and administered intraven@@ ously to the Bol@@ us@@ dose .
as soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , another monitoring is no longer required , provided , the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered right .
in patients with moderate kidney limitations ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , the one PCI is treated ( whether using bi@@ val@@ ir@@ m@@ ud@@ in against ACS or not ) , a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT &apos;s value is below 225 seconds , a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is sufficient , and the ACT is once again checked for 5 minutes after the second bolts dose .
in patients with moderate kidney damage , which resulted in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) , which resulted in approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes after the gift of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Bol@@ us without a dose adjustment in average 366 ± 89 seconds .
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and di@@ aly@@ sis patients the angi@@ ox is con@@ tra @-@ inde@@ xed ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with an@@ gi@@ ox can be re@@ directed 30 minutes after an intraven@@ ous gift of un@@ fra@@ c@@ tion@@ ated H@@ ep@@ arin or 8 hours after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of Lower H@@ ep@@ arin .
• commonly @-@ known hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity to the active ingredient , or an ir@@ reversible blood risk due to interference between hem@@ ost@@ ine and / or ir@@ reversible effects . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of blood , especially if bi@@ val@@ ir@@ m@@ ud@@ in is given in combination with another anti @-@ anti@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ( see Section 4.5 ) .
even though among PCI patients may occur at arter@@ ial pun@@ cture in most blood cells , in patients who under@@ go a per@@ kut@@ ary cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) , during the principle of principle you may occur everywhere in blood .
in patients who are treated war@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , a monitoring of IN@@ R @-@ value ( International norm@@ alised ratio ) should be taken to ensure that the value after depos@@ iting the treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ m@@ ud@@ in again is reached before the treatment existing .
starting from the knowledge about the action of antibodies of antibodies ( H@@ ep@@ arin , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ ol@@ y@@ tics or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ ten@@ em@@ mer ) , it can be assumed that these substances increase blood haz@@ ard .
during the combination of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in with t@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ ten@@ er sh@@ ields or antibodies are the clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ ics parameters in any case regularly .
the experimental studies are related to the effects of pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , the integration or post@@ nat@@ al development in@@ adequate ( see section 5.3 ) .

in both the bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in group as well as in the patients treated with H@@ ep@@ arin , women and patients over 65 years were more common to adverse events in male or younger patients .
severe bleeding have been defined according to the AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i scales for heavy bleeding such as in Table 2 .
both light and heavy bleeding occurred in Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in alone significantly less than in the groups with H@@ ep@@ arin plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ inhibit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ dru@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- In@@ hibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
a AC@@ U@@ ITY was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ oral , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular bleeding or blood de@@ cel@@ eration of ≥ 3 g / dl with well @-@ known blood de@@ cel@@ eration of ≥ 3 g / dl with well @-@ known blood station , Re@@ operation due to blood pressure , use of blood products to trans@@ fusion .
further , less frequently observed blood location that occurred at more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) were &quot; other &quot; pun@@ cture points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal , ear , nose or neck .
the following information on side effects are based on the data of a clinical study involving bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in at 6000 patients who under@@ go a PCI .
in both the bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in group as well as in the patients treated with H@@ ep@@ arin , there were more likely to be affected in women and patients over 65 years of age .
both light and heavy bleeding occurred in Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in significantly less than in the comparison group under H@@ ep@@ arin plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
the following side effects , which are not listed above , were reported after extensive application in practice , and are classified according to systems organic classes in table 6 .
in case of an over@@ dosage , treatment with be@@ ac@@ ro@@ ud@@ ine is immediately breaking down and the patient was tigh@@ tened with regard to the signs of blood pressure .
An@@ gi@@ ox contains Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , a direct and specific th@@ rom@@ bin@@ s , which bin@@ ds both in the cataly@@ tic centre and the an@@ ion@@ ic region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , ir@@ respective of whether Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is bound in the liquid phase or in Ger@@ inn@@ sel .
the binding of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine at Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and therefore its effect , is reversible because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in s@@ ins@@ ulated the binding of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Arg@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , which generates the role of the active centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in .
in addition , by Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , serum of patients who had come to h@@ ep@@ ar@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ t@@ open@@ ia / h@@ ep@@ ar@@ in@@ induced thro@@ mb@@ osis syndrome ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) , caused no t@@ rom@@ bo@@ oc@@ ytes reaction .

if the patients were performed in a PCI , an additional Bol@@ us of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in should be increased and the infusion for the duration of the intervention is increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h .
in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , un@@ fra@@ c@@ tion@@ ate H@@ ep@@ arin or E@@ no@@ x@@ ap@@ arin was administered according to relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute corne@@ a syndrome ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) in patients with un@@ stable corne@@ al syndrome ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ized to receive a GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or , either before the start of angi@@ ography ( at the time of the Rand@@ om@@ ization ) or at the PCI .
in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high risk areas required a angi@@ ography required within 72 hours , evenly over the 3 treatment arms .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used for the treatment of adults , adolescents and children from six years with diabetes , who need a treatment with ins@@ ulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdom@@ inal wall , the upper th@@ igh@@ s or the upper arm is administered as a continuous set with an ins@@ ulin pump .
diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough ins@@ ulin to regul@@ ating glucose levels ( sugar ) in the blood , or that non @-@ ins@@ ulin can be processed .
ins@@ ulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in diff@@ ers very slightly from Human@@ ins@@ ulin , and the change means that it works faster and a shorter active duration has as a short @-@ effective human ins@@ ulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra was used in combination with a long @-@ effective ins@@ ulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , where the body could not produce ins@@ ulin , in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years .
in type 2 diabetes , where the ins@@ ulin cannot be eff@@ ected in the body , A@@ pi@@ dra was examined in a study with 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indication for efficacy was the change of the concentration of the substance gly@@ col hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that shows how well the blood sugar is set .
in the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes , a decline of 0.14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) in comparison with a decline of 0.14 % at ins@@ ulin rate .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % for human normal ins@@ ulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra may not be applied to patients who are possibly ins@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against ins@@ om@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in or one of the other components , or in patients who suffer from a h@@ yp@@ og@@ ly@@ ca@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other drugs , which may vary on blood glu@@ ing tiles .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the Association of San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ ent@@ is Deutschland GmbH and approval for the placing of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is either a sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , either in the area of abdom@@ inal surface , to apply or sub@@ cut@@ aneous through continuous infusion in the area of abdom@@ inal cav@@ ity .
due to the reduced Glu@@ con@@ e@@ ogen@@ esis and the lower ins@@ ulin change , the ins@@ ulin need to be reduced in patients with a limitation of the liver function .
each change of the effectiveness strength , the brand ( Her@@ - St@@ eller ) , the ins@@ ulin ( normal , N@@ PH , zin@@ k@@ delayed , etc . ) , the type of ins@@ ulin ( animal ins@@ ulin ) and / or manufacturing method can draw a change of ins@@ ulin requirements .
3 A in@@ adequate dosage or dis@@ rup@@ ting of a treatment , especially in patients with an ins@@ ulin @-@ dependent diabetes , may lead to a hyper@@ glyc@@ emia and diabet@@ ic K@@ eto@@ azi@@ de ; these states are potentially life @-@ threat@@ ening .
changing a patient to another ins@@ ulin @-@ type or ins@@ ulin @-@ ins@@ ulin should be eff@@ ected under str@@ ingent medical supervision and can make a change of dosage .
the effect of a h@@ yp@@ og@@ ly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the active profile of the ins@@ ulin , and can therefore change at the change of treatment schem@@ as .
to the substances that increase the blood sugar @-@ sensitive activity and increase the tendency to h@@ yp@@ og@@ ly@@ ric@@ ots , include oral anti@@ diabet@@ ic , dis@@ op@@ yr@@ illi@@ es , dis@@ cot@@ ox@@ in , mon@@ o@@ amine oxid@@ ation , pent@@ oxi@@ f@@ yl@@ line , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ phen , sal@@ icy@@ cles and sulph@@ ur@@ amid antibiotics .
in addition , under the effect of sympath@@ ol@@ y@@ tics , like bet@@ wi@@ de@@ ans , Cl@@ on@@ id@@ in , Gu@@ an@@ eth@@ id@@ in and spare parts , the symptoms of ad@@ r@@ ener@@ gen counter@@ weight is not weak@@ ened or missing .
animal experimental studies for re@@ productive elast@@ icity showed no differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and Human@@ ins@@ ulin in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , the birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether ins@@ om@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ ins occurs in human breast milk , but generally ins@@ ulin is neither in breast milk , nor res@@ or@@ ted after oral application .

dry , cool , cool skin , fatigue , nerv@@ ousness or tre@@ mor , anxi@@ ety , unusual bleeding or weakness , confusion , concentration disorders , head@@ ache , nau@@ sea and pal@@ pit@@ ations .
Li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ rophy Will be missed to continuously change the inj@@ ector within the injection area , a li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ rophy may occur in the inj@@ ections .
heavy h@@ yp@@ og@@ ly@@ re boxes with consciousness can be given thanks to an in@@ tr@@ am@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glucose ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , which is given by a doctor or intraven@@ ous gift of glucose by a doctor .
after a glucose projection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the ur@@ gent matter for the heavy h@@ yp@@ og@@ ly@@ ca@@ emia and similar episodes .
ins@@ ulin sugar reduces blood sugar level by stimul@@ ating the peripheral glucose absorption ( especially due to sk@@ el@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) as well as the in@@ hibition of glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that during sub@@ cut@@ aneous mit@@ otic membrane in the effects occurs qu@@ icker and the active time shorter is shorter than in hu@@ - man@@ em normal ins@@ ulin .
in a study of 18 male persons at the age of 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes , ins@@ om@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in in therapeutic relevant dosing range from 0,0@@ 75 to 0.15 E / kg , showed a proportional increase of glu@@ ing effect , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a proportional increase of glu@@ eing effect , exactly as Human@@ ins@@ ulin .
ins@@ om@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has twice as fast active effect as a normal human ins@@ ulin and achieved the complete glu@@ ing effect for approximately 2 hours earlier than Human@@ ins@@ ulin .
from the data was evident that during an application of ins@@ om@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before meal a comparable post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ al glyc@@ em@@ ic control is reached like with human normal interest ulin which is given 30 minutes before meal .
ins@@ om@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before meal , a better post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ al control was reached than with human normal ins@@ ulin which was given 2 minutes before the meal .
if ins@@ ulin is turned 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal , there will be a similar glyc@@ em@@ ic control of such as human normal ins@@ ulin , which is given 2 Mi@@ xed before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) .
ins@@ om@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ ISIN : previously ) before the meal compared to human normal ins@@ ulin , which was given 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min ) before the beginning of the meal ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) was given before a meal ( Figure 1B ) .
ins@@ om@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in gift 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ ISIN ) after the beginning of the meal compared to human@@ ised Nor@@ - mal@@ ins@@ ulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the beginning of the meal ( Figure 1C ) .
