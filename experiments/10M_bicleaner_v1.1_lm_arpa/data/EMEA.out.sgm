<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Fund Report (EPAR), in which explains how the Committee of Human Medicine Act (CHMP) performed the studies carried out in order to obtain recommendations concerning the application of the pharmaceutical.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need more information on your disease or treatment, please read the packagage (also part of the EPAR) or apply to your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you wish for further information regarding the recommendations of CHMP, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of processed tablets (tablets which dissolve in the mouth) as a solution to take (1 mg / ml) and as a injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. wirling thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or vision of things that are not present), mistrust and madness; • bipolar-I disorder, an psychological disease, in which the patient (malignant high spirits) alternately have alternating with periods.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat more serious and severe lack of episodes and preventative episodes on patients who have applied to the drug in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">Injection solution is applied for fast control of disturbance or behavioural problems if the oral dosage of the medication is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both diseases can take the solution to insert or processed processed tablets of patients who prepare the swallow of tablets difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who use other drugs, the same as Abilify, should be adapted to the use of Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="10">This impairs signal transmission between brain cells by "neurotransmitter," i.e. chemical substances that enable communication of nerve cells to each other.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazol works mainly as "partial agitation" for the receptors for the neurotranitter dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazol like 5-hydroxytryptamine and dopamine, but in lower dimensions as the neurotranitter are being able to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Da Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine in schizophrenia and bipolar disturbance play a role, Aripiprazol contributes to normalize the activity of the brain, causing psychotic or manical symptoms, and its react will be prevented.</seg>
<seg id="14">The efficacy of Abilify, repeating the symptoms, was examined in three studies above up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injection solution was compared to 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar conditions that had suffered severe nausea, compared to a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was carried out over twelve weeks of 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study carried out efficacy of Abilify and placebo that were stabilized at 160 patients with which the manian symptoms had already been stabilized with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The effectiveness of the Abilify injection solution was compared to 301 patients with bipolar disturbance that had suffered severe naughness, compared to Lorazepam (another anti-psychological) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies the change of symptoms of patients were examined using a standard scala for bipolar disturbance or the number of patients who spoke to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also resulted studies of studies to investigate how the body absorbs the melting tablet and the solution to take resorate (decreases).</seg>
<seg id="20">In the two studies with the injection of injection, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9,75 mg or 15 mg received significantly more severe reduction in symptoms of unrest disturbance than the patients who received placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the application for the treatment of bipolar interference Abilify in four of five short-time studies of manical symptoms were more effective than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">In addition, Abilify prevented for up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo the re-acting episodes of previously treated patients and when an existing treatment was administered.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15 mg doses were also more effective than placebo in the symptoms and were similar to Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common adverse events of Abilify to take (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients), Akathisie (constant movement), dissemination, nausea (nausea), obsolini secretion (increased memory production), ticibly secretion (increased memory production), tiredness and exhaustion, oddity, insomnie (sleeping disorders) and anxiety (sleep disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">At the conclusion that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and from moderate to severe lack of episodes in patients who had mainly manical episodes and during which the lack of episodes on the treatment with Aripiprazol spoke about the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the committee came to the result that the advantages of injection processes during fast control of disturbance and behavioural problems in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with lack of episodes at bipolar-I disorders, if a oral therapy is not suitable, compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission granted the Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. for placing the placing of Abilify in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of regular multiple episodes of bipolar-I- disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had mainly manical episodes and their lack of episodes on the treatment with Aripiprazol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day, regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">An increased effectiveness in doses above a daily dose of 15 mg was not detected, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as monotherapies or combination therapy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar-I- disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">With residue to the larger sensitivity of this group of patients a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors are justify this (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 induction ector from combination therapy is used, the Aripizizol dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behaviour belongs to psychotic diseases and affecting disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changing an antimental therapy, also in treatment with Aripiprazol (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that patients with bipolar disturbance risk is not an increased suicidal risk with Aripiprazol compared to other antipsychotica.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazol should be applied with care of patients with known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or ischemic disease, conditions that preventative disorders (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure sensitive medicines) or hypertension (including acute and malignant shape).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Spelldyskinesien: in clinical trials, which one year or less continued, there were occasional reports on treatment with Aripiprazol's dyscinesis.</seg>
<seg id="39">When using ABILIFY patients showed signs and symptoms of a late dyskinesis, should be taken into consideration to reduce the dose or to break the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">When a patient signs and symptoms developed on a mns, or a clear fever without any additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotica must be removed including ABILIFY, including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore Aripiprazol in patients with clamper waste should be used in the anamnese or in states that are related to camper accidents in connection with caution.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazol in patients with psychosis which were associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripiprazole in comparison to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">There was however in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and the response to unwanted cerebrovascular events with Aripiprazol treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia in some cases are extremely and associated with ketoazide or hyperosmolarem coma or death, was reported in patients who were treated with atypical antimental agents including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessment for hyperglycemia-related events with ABILIFY and other atypical antipsychotic active substances treated patients who allow direct compare.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsy, polyuria, polyphagia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly with respect to glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">A weight gain is generally observed in schizophrens patients and in patients with bipolar manie due to commodities, the application of antipsychotica, with which weight gain as a side effect, could lead to severe complications and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripiprazol on the central nervous system, be careful when Aripiprazol in combination with alcohol or other central-effective medicines are taken with overply side effects such as Sealing (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2-antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripiprazol, but this effect is not relevant as clinically irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study of healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidin) increased the AUC of Aripiprazol by 107% while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, like fluoxetine and paroxetine, similar effects and therefore should be made similar dosisinductions.</seg>
<seg id="52">CYP2D6 'poor' (= "Poor") Metabolitioners can lead the joint application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher Plasma concentration of Aripiprazol when compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolic specialists.</seg>
<seg id="53">If you consider the common administration of ketoconazol or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, the potential benefits of potential risks in the patient should consider.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazol and HIV protectors, could have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dosisinductions.</seg>
<seg id="55">After depositing the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitors, the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the dose altitude before the start of the companion.</seg>
<seg id="56">Dilatazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with ABILIFY can be administered together with ABILIFY, can be anticipated with a defined increase in Aripizolini concentration.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical studies show doses of 10-30 mg of Aripiprazol per day did not have any significant effect on the metabolic type of CYP2D6 (Dextromethorphan / 3-methodxymorphan ratio), 2C19 (warfarine), 2C19 (Omeprazol) and 3A4 (Dextromethorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to inform their doctor if they are pregnant or a pregnancy during the treatment with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to the insufficient data subject to safety during human beings and due to reproductive studies at the beast may not be applied in the pregnancy, unless the possible value justifies the potential risk for mockus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, in other antipsychotica the patients should be warned against it, dangerous machines, including power vehicles, until they are sure that Aripiprazol has no negative impact on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following adverse events appeared more frequently (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medical relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency below must be defined according to the following criteria: frequently (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study about 52 weeks occurred in patients who were treated with Aripiprazole (25.8%) of EPS including parking insonism, Akathisie, Dystony and Dyskinesis, compared to patients who were treated with Haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long term study about 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19% in patients under Aripionzol treatment and 13.1% in patients were placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study about 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 14.8% were treated in patients who were treated with Aripionzole, and 15.1% in patients under ocladding therapy.</seg>

<seg id="67">In another study about 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26.6% in patients under Aripionzol treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term trial period over 26 weeks in a placebo controlled study the incidence of EPS 18.2% was treated for patients under Aripionzol- treatment and 15.7% for placebo-treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazol and placebo in which potentially clinical changes of the routinely controlled laboratory parameters were found, yielded no medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases of CPK (creatine-phosphokinase), generally temporary and common, were observed at 3.5% of patients treated with placebo patients compared to 2.0% of the patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">Among the events that may occur in connection with anti-psychotic therapy, the malignant neurosurgery syndrome, Spätdyskinesis and crampfancases, unwanted cerebrovascular events and increased mortality with older Dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical studies and since the market launch were unintentional or deliberately acute overdose with Aripiprazol alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without obituaries.</seg>
<seg id="73">There are no information about the efficacy of a hemodialysis in the treatment of an overdosage with Aripiprazol; it is unlikely that Häckalysis has an overdosage of benefits since Aripiprazole has a high plasma integration.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the effectiveness of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar-I-interference via the combination of a partial agonist effect on Dopamine D2- and Serotonin 5HT1a- receptors and a antagonist effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazol showed a high affinity to the Dopamine D2- and D3 receptor as well as a fresh affinity to the Dopamine D4-, to the Serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7, for alpha-1-adrgen and for histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">The results of Aripiprazol in dosages from 0.5 to 30 mg once daily showed a dosisdependent reduction in the engagement of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptors, on Nucleus caudatus and on the turf.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) of 1.228 schizophrine patients with positive or negative symptoms showed a statistically significant improvement of psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a Haloperil-controlled study, 52 percent of the response in response to study medication took part in both groups (Aripiprazole 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values of measured values defined as secondary Studied, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg- Depth Rate scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than in Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study about 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia showed a significantly higher reduction in response rate, which was 34% in the Aripigeon group and 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an oil-controlled, multinational double-blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study trip 'weight gain' was significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg) at an average weight of approximately 5.6 kg.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monootherapy studies with more flexible dosing for 3 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disturbation, Aripiprazol showed an adverse effectiveness in reducing the reduction in reduction of more than 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monootherapy study about 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a manian or mixed episode of bipolar-I-interference, Aripiprazol showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and actively controlled Monotherapy studies in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I-interference, with or without psychotic characteristics, Aripiprazol displayed a comparison of placebo in week 3 and a lasting effect, which was comparable to lithium or semi-eridol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">Aripiprazol also demonstrated a comparable share of patients with symptomatic remission of the mane on how lithium or semi-eridol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study about 6 weeks of patients with a manic or mixed characteristics of a bipolar-I-interference, with or without psychotic characteristics, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazol found an overlegenic effectiveness in reducing the reduction in reducing symptoms compared to monotherapist with lithium or Valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled study about 26 weeks followed by a long-time enlargement phase over 74 weeks for manic patients who had achieved remission in front of placebo during a stabilising from placebo in comparison to the prevention of a bipolar retreat, mainly with the prevention of a bipolar backbone.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the elongation and hydroxylic of Aripiprazol, the N-Dealkylation is separated by CYP3A4 catalytic.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean Elimination period is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazol for extensive metabolic agents on CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours at 'poor' (= "Poor") Metabolizing over CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazol there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy volunteers, as well as showed a pharmacokinetical investigation of schizophrenic patients no gender-dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A pop-specific evaluation in pharmacokinetics revealed no indication of clinically significant differences in ethnic origin or the impact of smoking at pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="92">Pharmacokinetical properties of Aripiprazol and elongo Aripiprazol were similar in patients with severe kidney failure in comparison to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study involving subjects with different common liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazol and elongo Aripiprazol, but the study included only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of the class C, which is not sufficient to pull slums on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies on security harmacology, toxicity at repeated treatment, reproduction toxicity, toxicity and to canogens, the preclinical data could not recognize any special hazards for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only during dosages or expositions that exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans, so they have only limited or no significance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects overrecorded a dosisdependant on toxicity after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (corresponds with 3 to 10 mg / kg / day) and combined steroid-carcinoma / carcinoma during female rats (AUC) at the recommended maximum dosage of human dose (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose of humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, a result of the abolition of Sulphate conjugate of the hydrochloric conjugate is determined from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3fold between the mean clinical dose or 16- to 81times the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, in the human gall at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg. of Sulphate conjugate concentration of hydroxy- Aripiprazol found no more than 6% of concentrations that were detected in the study over 39 weeks in the gall of monkeys, and lie far below the limit values (6%) of the in vitro solubility.</seg>

<seg id="291">Abraxane may cause side effects like tiredness (very frequent) and Schwinn (often), which can work on the road tightness, and ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="292">Following are the most common and most important incidents listed in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer that were treated in the pivotal clinical phase III trial once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 seraxane.</seg>
<seg id="293">Neutropenie was the most striking important hematological toxicity (79% of patients reported) and was reported quickly reversibly and dosisers; leukopenia was reported in 71% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="294">Anemia (Hb &lt; 10 g / dl) was observed in 46% of patients treated with aborraxane patients and was severe in three cases (Hb &lt; 8 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="295">The side effects listed in Table 1 are listed in conjunction with the administration of detraxane as monotherapies at any dose and indication in studies (N = 789).</seg>

<seg id="300">Oacquisance 1 The frequency of the sensitivity transactions is calculated based on a definitive fall in a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">Since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of actual frequency is possible and there was no correlation with these events.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an anti-microtubuli active agent that promotes conforming the microtubuli from the tubullet tubes and stabilizes the microtubuli by inhibiting their deolymerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to an inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubular network, which is essential for the vitale phase and the erotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that Albumine the transaction of plasma components in the endothelial cells and in the frame of in-vitro studies proved that the presence of Albumin transports the transport of Paclitaxel through the endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is believed that this improved transendothelial transport through the gp-60 album revitally conveyors and due to the albumen protein SPARC (whichted protein acidic rich in cysteine) occurs in cysteine) a Paclitaxel accumulation in the area of the Tumors.</seg>
<seg id="306">The use of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two non-mapped studies and of 454 patients who were treated in a randomized Phase III study study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In a study, 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with detraxane, which was given in the form of an infusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study, a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as infusion in 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multicentre study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer, which received every 3 weeks a monotherapist with Paclitaxel 175 mg / m2 as a 3-hour infusion for prevention of allergic reaction (N = 225) or in the form of Abraxane 260 mg / m2 as a 30-minute infusion without medication (N = 229).</seg>

<seg id="312">9 Results for the general response rate and time to progression free survival and progression-free survival and survival for patients who receive &gt; First-Line therapy are shown below.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity compared to Paclitaxel was evaluated by improving one degree for patients who lived at a time during the therapy of a peripheral neuropathy degree 3.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral neuropathy to Abklingen to Baseline due to the cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and is still unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The pharmacokinetics of the general-Paclitaxel after 30- and 180-minute infusion of abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 has been determined in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="316">The exposure of active exposure (AUC) increased from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml analogue to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 According to an intravenous administration of detraxane patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the Paclitaxel plasma concentration increased in multiphase mode.</seg>
<seg id="318">The average distribution volume amounted to 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume has a far-reaching extravene distribution and / or individual binding of Paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study with patients with advanced tumors, pharmacokinetical properties of Paclitaxel was compared with intravenous 30 mg / m2 seraxane with the values following a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2 A solvent containing Paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The Clearance of Paclitaxel was higher (43%) after the Abraxane-injection (43%) as after a solvent containing Paclitaxel injection, and also the distribution volume was higher (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature on in-vitro studies of human liver microbiological and tissue samples it is reported that Paclitaxel associated with 6α-Hydroxypaclitaxel and two smaller metabolites (3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel) and 6α -3" -p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel) metabolized.</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer, the mean total dose is less than 1% of the given overall dose with less than 1% of the metabolism 6α-Hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p-Hydroxypaclitaxel, which has a far-rich non-renal clearing.</seg>

<seg id="386">Anchomiymptomas and compliance checks may vary depending on the age, gender and overall disease last; therefore, the evaluation of individual clinical trials and sickness by the doctor may be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="387">A rise in hemoglobs by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients can occasionally be observed in one patient's individual hemoglobin values or under the hemoglobbin- target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">In view of this hemoglobbivariability should be tried on an appropriate dose management that hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / mL (6.2 mmol / l) to 12 g / mL (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the hemostal value exceeds 2 g / l (1.25 mmol / l) per month, it exceeds the permanent hemoglobin value of 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epetin-alfa dose is reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be close meshed to ensure that Epoetin alfa is in the lowest approved dose which is required for the control of anemia and analysts.</seg>
<seg id="392">The present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.75 mmol / l) may need more resistant doses than patients with which the initial anemia is less heavy (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>

<seg id="401">Due to contrast to the initial value of &lt; 1 g / µl (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) or the Retikulozyk count increased by &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared with the output value, a response to epetin-alfa treatment is unlikely and the treatment should be canceled.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with mild anemia (hematokrit 33 - 39%), in which the primary storage of ≥ 4 blood conservations required, should be breamed up at a dose of 600 mg / kg body weight twice weekly for 3 weeks before surgery.</seg>
<seg id="403">With the Iron substitution it should be as early as possible - for example some weeks before the beginning of the autologous blood screening program - that started to have large iron reserves prior to the beginning of the excavation therapy.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dosage is 600 i.e. / kg Epoetin alfa, which should be given once a week for three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) before the surgery procedure and the day of intervention (day 0).</seg>

<seg id="416">Controlled clinical studies have no significant benefit that is due to the gift of epoches when the hemoglobbination is attributable to control of analysts and the prevention of blood transfusions required.</seg>
<seg id="417">The haematographic increase should amount to approximately 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month to minimize the risk of hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic renal failure and clinically evidenter coronular heart failure or shock-sufficiency should not be exceeded under Section 4.2 recommended upper limit of hemoglobin target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to the present findings, the treatment of anemia with Epoetinsufficiency in adults are not accelerated so that further dialysis failure should not be accelerated so far.</seg>
<seg id="420">With cancer patients under chemotherapy, a 2-3-week delay between epetin-alfa-free and the Erythropoetin response should be taken into account (patients who may have to be transcoding).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the slope is higher than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or a Hb value of 13 g / dl (8.1 mmol / l), the dose must minimize the risk for possible thrombotic incidents (see section 4.2) of patients with chemotherapyconditional anemia (see section 4.2) with the goal of keeping the hemoglobbvalue between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision for application recombinant Erythropoetine should be based on a benefit-risk assessment of the respective patients that should also consider the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">In patients who are provided for a major elective orthopedic procedure, if possible, before the beginning of the Epoetin-alfa treatment, the cause of anemia should be investigated and treated accordingly.</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Fund Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee of Human Medicine Act (CHMP) carried out the studies carried out in order to obtain recommendations concerning the application of the pharmaceutical.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes) in patients (especially overweight patients), where Metformin (a diabetic medicine) can not be applied. • It can be used together with another diabetic drug (Dualtherapy).</seg>
<seg id="751">In addition to metformin in patients (particularly overweight patients), the metformin alone cannot be satisfied with metformin alone in the highest tolerable dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulphur pulp or insulin, the previous dose of the PE therapy can be retained, except for patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); this should be reduced to the dose of sulphylharnfuel or insulin.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's own insulin can be used better and sinks the blood sugar level, which means that type 2 diabetes is better.</seg>
<seg id="754">For more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of acetone was investigated in tripletherapy; patients received a combination of metformin with a sulphylharnant, in addition they received either Actos or placebo for 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies the concentration of a substance was measured in the blood (glycopylized hemoglobin, HbA1c) which indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to a lowering of the HbA1c-value, which allows to reduce blood glucose levels when using the doses of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the TripleTherapy study, the effect of the additional gift of Actos for existing treatment with metastases and a sulphylharnant showed a reduction in HbA1c values by 0.94%, while the additional gift of placebo led to a reduction of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study, in which the combination of Actos and insulin was examined in 289 patients, patients receiving Actos in addition to insulin had increased by 0.69% after 6 months, compared with 0.14% in the patients who received placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common adverse events in connection with Actos were visionaries, infections of the upper respiratory tracts (cold), weight gain and hypothesaesthesia (reduced sensitivity to stimulating).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos must not be used in patients suffering from patients suffering from Pioglitazone or one of the other components, even in patients with liver problems, cardiac insufficiency or diabetic Ketoazide (high ketlevel - acidity).</seg>
<seg id="761">It was decided that acetone should be used as an alternative to standard treatment with metastases in patients with metastases should not be displayed when Metformin is not displayed.</seg>
<seg id="762">October 2000 the European Commission granted the Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited approval for placing an account of Actos in the entire European Union.</seg>

<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is adjusted with insulin and incompatibility due to contraindications or incompatibility (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">For use of Pioglitazone in patients under 18 years of age, no data is available, therefore it is not recommended in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients who are at least one risk factor (i.e. earlier heart attack or symptomatic correlated heart disease), the doctor should begin to start a decompensated heart failure, the doctor should start the treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of cardiac insufficiency, weight gain or ecomme, especially those with reduced cardiac reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of cardiac insufficiency, weight gain and ecomme when Pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular risk study involving Pioglitazone in patients under 75 years of age with type 2 diabetes mellitus and previously advanced macrovascular disease was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">This study showed an increase in reports of heart failure, which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output liver cells (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the standard) or with other signs of liver disease, Pioglitazone can not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT mirror increases to 3 times the upper limit of the standard range, the liver parameters are as soon as possible, as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient has developed symptoms which point to a hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, Oberbauchessness, fatigue, Appetitessness and / or darker Harn, are the liver cells.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether the treatment of patients with Pioglitazone should be continued until the demonstration of the laboratory has been derived from clinical assessment.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with Pioglitazone, a dosisdependent weight gain was detected, which can stir in fat deposits and is connected in some cases with a liquid requirements.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of a hemodilution combined with Pioglitazone, a significant reduction in the middle hemoglobbins (relative reduction by 4%) and hematocrits (relative reduction by 4.1%).</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative controlled trials with Pioglitazone in patients under metformin (relative reduction of hemostorrits by 3.6-4.1%) and to a lower extent in patients under Sulphylharnstoff and insulin (relative reduction of hemoglobbins by 1-2% and hematocrits by 1-3,2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insinsensitivity affects patients suffering from Pioglitazone or triple-combination therapy with a Sulphylharnant or as a double-combination therapy with insulin, the risk of dosed plypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">Following the introduction of thiazolidindions, including Pioglitazone, an appearance or deterioration of a diabetic macular edema was reported using a reduction of visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear if there is a direct connection between the ingestion of Pioglitazone and the occurrence of macular edema, but deceitful doctors should be aware of the possibility of a macular edema, if patients suffer from visual acuity should be considered to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of messages undesirable events of randomized, randomised, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazone</seg>
<seg id="782">The arithmetic fracture was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years treated with Pioglitazone treated women and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years for women who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the study, a study about 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures were 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years), compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 questionnaires per 100 patient years) with patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">The patients should be aware of a pregnancy, and if a patient wish a pregnancy or a patient, the treatment is absent (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies for examining the interactions have shown that Pioglitazenon has no relevant effects on pharmacokinetics or pharmacological dynamics of Digoxin, Warfarin, phenprocoumon and Metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with medicines that are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contradictiva, cyclosporin, Calciumcanalblocker and HMGCoA-reductasinhibitor are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous use of Pioglitazone with the fibrosis (a cytochrome P450 2C8- Inhibitor) resulted in an increase of the AUC of Pioglitazone in order to increase the 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">Simultaneous use of Pioglitazone with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 induction) resulted in a decrease of the AUC of Pioglitazone at 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is primarily due to the treatment with Pioglitazone which reduces hyperinsulin and increased insulin-resistant insulin and thus reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for reddish growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; frequently &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1000; rare &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, single cases: unknown (from this data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="791">This lead to a temporary variation of the turmoors and the refractive index of lens, as it also observed with other hypoglycaemic substances.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with Pioglitazone, ALT ascents than threefold the upper limit of the norm range is common equally among placebo but more rarely than in comparative groups under metformin or Sulfonylharnant.</seg>
<seg id="793">In a Outcome study in patients with pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease, the frequency of a severe cardiac disease was 1.6% higher than placebo when Pioglitazone bzw.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since its market launch, rarely over heart failure in Pioglitazone has been reported, however, when Pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the Anamnese.</seg>
<seg id="795">There was a summary analysis of notifications of randomized incidents regarding bone fraud, randomised, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazon groups and over 7,400 patients treated with comparative study groups.</seg>
<seg id="796">Over a period of 3.5 years of current proactive study, fractures were treated at 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with Pioglitazon, compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) with patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">During taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms occur.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone appears to work specifically for a activation of specific core remunitions (PPAR-γ)), which results in the animal model to an increased insinsensitivity of liver, fat and skeleton muscles.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazone reduces the glucose production in the liver and increases peripheral glucose in case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study of Pioglitazone versus Gliclazid as monootherapy has been continued for two years to investigate the time until the term of therapeutic efficacy (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 treatment months).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after onset of therapy, blood sugar control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) could be found in 69% of treated patients (compared with 50% of patients under Gliclazid).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study more than 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was adjusted in spite of insulin and insulin was randomized to Pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazone, the mean HbA1c - was reduced by 0.45%, compared to the patients who still received non-insulin, reducing the insulin dosage in the group treated with Pioglitazone group.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over one year showed a statistically significant decrease in the album / creatinine quota in comparison to the output values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazone (monootherapy with 45 mg versus Plazebo) was tested in a small, 18-week examination for type 2 diabetics.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials, compared to placebo a reduction of the total plasma-triglyceride and the free fatty acids and an increase of HDL- cholesterol and slightly, however clinically not significantly increased LDL- Cholesterinspiegel.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years of reduced Pioglitazone compared to placebo, metformin or Gliclazid the total plasmatriddlers and the free fatty acids and increased the HDL cholesterol.</seg>
<seg id="808">In comparison to placebo, under Pioglitazone, no statistically significant increase in LDL Cholesterinspiegel was detected, while under Metformin and Gliclazide were observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study of 20 weeks, Pioglitazone not only reduce the sober-triglyceride level, but also improved trimmed triglyceride level, this also provides a effect on the triglycerid absorption than also on hepatic triglycerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the proactive study, a cardiovascular disease study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and previously advanced macrovascular disease were randomized in addition to existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular therapy conducted either Pioglitazone or placebo for over a period of up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="811">After the oral application, Pioglitazone is quickly resorabsorbed, with the top concentations of an unaltered Pioglitazone in plasma usually 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV to efficacy in about the three times the efficacy of Pioglitazone, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal pronounced.</seg>
<seg id="813">In Interactions studies, Pioglitazone has no relevant effect on pharmacokinetics or pharmacological dynamics of Digoxin, Warfarin, phenprocoumon and Metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous use of Pioglitazone with the fibrosis (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inhibitor) or with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 induction) increases and lowers the plasma concentration of Pioglitazone (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After the oral application of radioactive marketed Pioglitazone in humans the marker was primarily found in the fences (55%) and to a lower extent in the harn (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The medium plasma-Elimination canal of unaltered Pioglitazone is 5-6 hours while the entire active metabolic rate is 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma concentration of Pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function lower than in healthy volunteers, but the data of the oral Clearance is similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies, in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys agree after repeated administration plasma expansion with hematution, anemia and reversible eccentric cardiac disease.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is primarily due to the treatment with Pioglitazone that reduces Hyperinsuline emia and increased insulin-resistant insulin and thus reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for reddish growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long term studies (up to 2 years), increased incidence of hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumours (in male rats) of the urine epithelium.</seg>

<seg id="825">In a further study about two years the effects of a combination therapy of metformin each with Pioglitazone or Gliclazide were examined.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials over 1 year showed a statistically significant decrease in the album / creatinine quota in comparison to the output values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study of 20 weeks, Pioglitazone not only reduce the sober-triglyceride level, but also improved the postprandial increased triglyceride level, this can also be seen on the Tryglyzerid absorption as well as to the hepatic Tryglizerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study was missing the goal in their primary endpoint, a combination of the overall mortality, stroke amputation above the root arteries, leg amputation above the arterial, coronary Revascularisation and Revascularisation of the leg arteries indicate that with the intake of Pioglitazone there are no cardiovascular risk.</seg>

<seg id="1436">The data in clinical trials include that a successful treatment is possible in most cases when the valley level should not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the valley level of Tacrolimus in the whole blood was usually treated according to liver transplants in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and retransplant patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent processing of liver, kidney and cardiac transplant, blood concentrations were generally used in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has resulted in serious events, including reactions or other side effects, which may occur in the result of Tacrolimus underwater or overexposition.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always be maintained the same tactics formulation and maintain the corresponding daily dosage; statements of formulation or regime should only be made under the tightening control of a medical field of transplantation (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>

<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of the application may be applied to the treatment of bleeding or the prevention of bleeding in surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with hemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency, causing blood-problems like bleeding in joints, muscles or internal organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma but is produced according to a method which is called "recombinant DNA technology":</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell that has been introduced to a gene (DNA) that it is capable of creating the human transmission factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advate is authorised to another in the European Union called Recombinate, but it is different, so that the medicine does not contain any proteins of human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate Hämophilia A, including a study with 53 children under six years, the application of the medicine was investigated for prevention of blood and surgical intervention.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study, the efficacy of reactions in the prevention of bleeding within 86% of the 510 new bloodstream tends were awarded with "excellent" or "good."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common adverse events of advanced (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are Schwinn, headache, pyrexie (fever) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Patients may not be applied to patients who may be insensitive (allergic) against human transmission factor VIII, Mauser or Hamsterprotein or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission granted a approval to the company Baxter AG a regulatory approval in the European Union for placing on the market.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage and duration of the substitution, according to the severity of factor VIII, according to the place and the extent of blood and the clinical condition of the patient.</seg>

<seg id="1545">During treatment of treatment, the appropriate dose and frequency of injections enriched to factor VIII plasma tiles.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients can distinguish in their reaction to factor VIII, various in vivo recovery and have different semesters.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 prophylaxis for long-term prophylaxis of blood in patients with severe haemophilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 i.e. by factor VIII per kg of body weight within 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII plasma activities will not be reached, or if blood pressure is not ruled with an appropriate dose, a test must be carried out in order to prove your inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors it is possible that the factor VIII treatment is not effective, so that other therapeutic measures must be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1550">According to the patient's administration, the administration rate should not be exceeded, with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralizing Antibodies (inhibitors) against factor VIII is a known complication in treatment of patients with haemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always against the prokoagulation activity of factor VIII and IgG Immunoglobuline that are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml of plasma using specially modified Bethesda Assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors, correlated with the extent of exposure to factor VIII, whereby the risk is in the first 20 expositions at the largest and of genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In pre-treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 exposure days and anamneatous inhibitor development, following conversion from a recombinant factor VIII product to another, reoccur by (lowest titres) inhibitors.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data subject, the CHMP has still considered a positive value for use for the first time, however, considering that the safety profile has to be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, the CHMP relies on the basis of the safety profile of ADVATE, which makes it necessary for all 6 months to apply a further renewal procedure for authorisation in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In December 2008, Genex Molecular Limited issued the Committee for Human Medicine Act (CHMP), proposed that the company takes its application on approval for the marketing of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">However, however, the breast, the brain, bones or wheat parts (fabric, connecting other structures in the body, surrounds and support) of it.</seg>
<seg id="1642">It is a kind of virus that has been genetically modified to carry a gene in the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">In the virus in Advexin, there is a "Adenovirus" which has been changed so that there is no copies of himself and therefore no infections be able to trigger people.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advantin would have injected directly into the tumors and allow the cancer cells to form the normal p53-protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein which is formed from the non-defective human body existing p53 gene, is usually contributes to the restoration of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1646">The p53-protein is defective, with which the p53 gene is defective, the p53-protein does not work correctly, and the cancer cells can grow further.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company also submitted data from a study with a patient in front of the Li-Fraumeni cancer in the field of subspecies, into the bones and in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP answers to the company's answers to the questions, there were still some questions unexplained.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the exam of the initially submitted documents, the CHMP submitted a list of questions that will be sent to the company.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to the CHMP view, no sufficiently proved that injection of Advexin Li-Fraumeni-tumors benefit benefits for patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The Committee also concerns concerns concerning the processing of the medicine in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the pharmaceutical.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company had not sufficiently proven that we can be produced in a reliable way and that it is neither responsible for the environment nor for people who come in contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company won't be aware of whether the withdrawal consequences for patients who currently has clinical trials or "Compassionate-Use" programs with Advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"modified efficiencies" means that the tablets are so assembled so that one of the effective constituents are immediately released and the other will be released slowly over a few hours.</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze becomes the treatment of symptoms of seasonal allergies (Heuvupfen, caused by a allergy against pollen inflammation of the nose) in patients with nasal mucous hemorrhage (boped nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and adolescents from 12 years the recommended dose of Aeropaze twice daily is a tablet that should be taken entirely with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and completed as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (stopped nose).</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drugs can be found in the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main content measurements were the changes in the severity of the havein oculptome that were reported by the patients before the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients carried their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and evaluated with a standard scale, how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">For consideration of all Heuvaczensymptomas, the patient's constipation reported about a decrease of symptoms by 46.0%, compared with 35,9% in the patients, the Pseudoephedrin alone income.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was seen, the patients showed a reduction in symptoms by 37,4% versus 26.7% in patients who have Desloratadin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common adverse events of Aerinaze (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are speedykarst (cardiac disease), pharyngitis (pharetitessness), obstruction, headache, fatigue, insomnia (sleeplessness), sleep disorders and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may in patients who may be insensitive (allergic) versus Desloratadin, pseudoephedrin or one of the other parts, against adrenerate active ingredients or Loratadin (another drugs for the treatment of allergies) are not applied.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze may also be used in patients who suffer from a narrow angle glaucoma (hypertension), cardiac disease (hypertension), or hyperthyroid (overfunction of thyroid) or caused by a hemorrhagic strike (caused by a brain bleeding) or have a risk of hemorrhagic strike.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission granted a approval for the Inverters of Aerinaze in the entire European Union on 30 July 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, but it is all to kill (i.e. without them to break or cut it).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should not be used for children under 12 years due to the absence of data for infertility and efficacy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after cling the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days as long as long-term application can take the activity of Pseudoephedrin with the time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Following the decline of the mucous membranes of the mucous membranes, the treatment may be continued when needed with desloratadin as monotherapies.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since Aerinaze Pseudoephedrin contains, the medicine is also contrasting in patients who are treated with a monoaminoxidase (MAO) inhibitors or within 2 weeks after completion of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is attributable to alphamimetical activity with other vasoconstrictors such as Bromothieves, Pergolid, ergotamine, Dihydroergotamine or other decades (phenylpropanolamine, phenylephrine, Ephedrin, Oxymetacolin, Napololin, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">Safety and efficacy of these combination therapy were not tested for this patient-counter top levers and the data are not enough to submit relevant recommendations to the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Safety and efficacy of aerinaze was not tested in patients with kidney or liver function and the data are not enough to submit relevant recommendations to the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients need to be informed that the treatment at the occurrence of hypertension or tachykarations or of palpitations, heart rhythms, nausea or etaizing of other neurological symptoms (like headache or amplification of the headache) must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="1677">In the treatment of the following patient groups, patients with cardiac arrhythmia • Patients with hypertension • Patients with myocardial infarction in Anamnese, Diabetes Mellitus, bladder, or Bronchospasmus in Anamnese.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze provides at least 48 hours prior to the performing dermatological tests, because Antihistamine is otherwise positive reactions to prevent digesters to prevent or in their extent.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In addition to clinical trials with Desloratadin, where Erythromycin or Ketoconazol was additionally administered, however, no clinically relevant interactions or changes of the plasma concentration of Desloratadin were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">No significant differences between patients with Desloratadin and the placebo could be noted, regardless of whether Desloratadin alone or with alcohol was taken.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloratadadenzyme was not yet identified, so that interaction with other drugs cannot be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin inhibits in vivo CYP3A4, and in-vitro studies have shown that the medicine CYP2D6 does not inhibits and neither a substrate even a inhibitor of the P-glycoprotone.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The infertility of the application of aerobaze during pregnancy is not secured, experiences gained from a large number of affected pregnancies, however, no increase of frequency abnormalities compared to the frequency of normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproductive studies are not always transferred to humans in humans and on the basis of vasoconstrictor properties of Pseudoephedrin should not be used in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be clarified however, that it may occur in very rare cases that may cause impairment of traffic or the ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1686">Symptoms vary between a ZNS depression (sedation, Apnoe, diminated mental attention, cyanosis, Koma, heart-circulation collaps) and a ZNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, tremor, volcanic acid) with possible claws.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headache, anxiety, obstruction, respiratory sufficiency, heart failure, tissues, nausea, vomiting, nausea, vomiting, precordial pain, dizziness, tinnitus, respiratory diseases and hypertension or hypotonia.</seg>
<seg id="1688">A ZNS-stimulation is particularly likely to occur in children, as well as atropin typical symptoms (mouth-dried, pupil, and dilatation, skin irritation, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include both the inhibition of the release of inflammatory cytokinen like IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / Basophile, as well as the inhibitors of the aristocratic P-seless expression on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose study with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg showed no effect on standard measurements of flight performance including amplification subjective battles or tasks that are connected to the fly.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical trials, a increased frequency of 5 mg. daily was detected by placebo in comparison to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of Pseudoephedrin in the recommended dose may cause more sympathetic effects, such as an increase of blood pressure, a tachment or manifestations of a ZNS.</seg>
<seg id="1693">1,248 patients ranged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergienic rhinitis with 414 patients received Aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies, histamine antagonist effectiveness of Aeropaze Tablets was determined by the overall score for symptomatic (except Nasenschlermination), significantly higher than under a monotherapist with Pseudoephedrin over the 2 week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The effectiveness of Aeropaze tablets with regard to the swapped effect, determines significantly higher than under a monotherapies with desloratadin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The effectiveness of Aeropaze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of sex, age, or ethnic origin.</seg>
<seg id="1697">In the framework of a single dose study of pharmacokinetics by Aerinaze Desloratadin was verifiable within 30 minutes after the administration in plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">Following the peroral application of Aeropaze in healthy volunteers over 14 days, the flow weight of Desloratadin, 3-hydroxydesloratadin and pseudoephedrin per day 10 was reached.</seg>
<seg id="1699">As part of a pharmacokinetical multipldosisstudy, which was conducted with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects, it was noted that four subjects Desloratadin poorly versely stained.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A components interest study indicates that the exposure (Cmax and AUC) of Pseudoephedrin was bioequivalent according to the exposure of a aerodynamic tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on conventional studies on security harmacology, toxicity in repetitive administration, for obotoxicity and to reproductive acid the preclinical data with Desloratadin do not recognize any special hazards for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination did not ate more toxicity than their individual components, and the observed effects were generally used in connection with the ingredients of Pseudoephedrin.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive protein studies, the combination of Loratadin / Pseudoephedrin was not termed in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rabbits at a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>

<seg id="1722">Aerius was involved in eight studies involving approximately 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic Rhinitis (including four studies with seasonal allergienic rhinitis and two studies in patients who had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">The effectiveness was measured by the change of symptoms (itching, number and size of paddling, impairment of sleep and performance on days) before and after six weeks of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies were submitted to prove that the body should take the syrup, the solution to insert and the processed tablets in the same way as the tablets and the use of children unthinkable.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In an allergic rhinitis, when the results of all studies were taken, the two-week treatment with 5 mg of Aerius resulted in an average decrease of symptoms (symptoms of symptoms) by 25 to 32%, compared to the approval of 12 to 26% in the patients receiving a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In the two studies of Urtikaria the decrease of symptoms after six weeks with Aerius 58 and 67% compared with 40 and 33% compared to placebo patients were treated.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius may not be applied to patients who may be insensitive (allergic) against desloratadin, Loratadin, or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission granted a approval to the European Union for placing an issue of Aerius in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet once daily, with one or without a meal, to alleviate the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic Rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There are limited experience from clinical trials to efficacy in the application of Desloratadin in adolescents from 12 to 17 years (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">Treatment of intermittent allergic Rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks) should be effected according to the previous disease and may be resumed after restoring the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1732">During persistent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms of 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks) the patient can be recommended during the allergy period.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not found in the context of clinical trials with Desloratadin tablets, where Erythromycin or Ketoconazol was administered additionally (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical pharmacological study, ingestion and alcohol not amplified the performance of alcohol before alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, patients should be clarified however, that it may occur in very rare cases that may cause impairment of traffic or the ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1736">Clinical trials in different indications, including allergic Rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3% more adverse events in patients with Aerius when treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most common adverse events, which was reported as reported in placebo (1,2%), mouth-dried (0.8%) and headache (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study with 578 youthful patients from 12 to 17 years, the most common side effect, these occurred in 5.9% of patients who were treated with Desloratadin and were treated with placebo in 6.9% of patients who were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">In a multidisciplinary study, with up to 45 mg of Desloratadin (ninety clinical dose), no clinically relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes both the inhibition of the release of inflammatory cytokinen like IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / Basophile, as well as the inhibition of expression of hemophonic P-seless on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">In the framework of a clinical study with multi-doses, in the Desloratadin in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical pharmacological study, in the Desloratadin in a dosage of 45 mg. daily (the newlytimes of clinical dose) was given over ten days, no extension of the QTc interval can be found.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dosis- study with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg showed no effect on standard measurements of flight performance including amplification subjective battles or tasks that are connected to the fly.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in the alleviation of symptoms such as Niesen, Nasensecretion and Juckreiz of the nose, itching, tear and blends of eyes as well as Juckreiz on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonal and perennial, allergic Rhinitis can be divided in dependence on the symptoms of symptoms also in intermittent allergic Rhinitis and persistent allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic Rhinitis is defined as occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persistent allergic rhinitis is defined as occurrence of symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As the result of the total score on the loss of life at Rhino-juntivitis was shown, Aerius effectively reduces pathitis due to seasonal allergies.</seg>
<seg id="1749">Chronic idiopathic urticaria has been investigated for further forms of the Urtikaria, as the underlying pathophysiology remains similar to the eatology in the different shapes and become an easy-speculation.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since the histamine extraction system is expected that Desloratadin is expected to improve the primitive idiopathic urticaria, also in other forms of urticaria, which is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guides.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving Pruritus and the approach of size and number of quaddling at the end of the first dose intervals.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamine for chronic idiopathic urticaria, minority patients who did not react to Antihistamine from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">Improvement of the itching average by more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with placebo patients compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Treatment with Aerius reduced the disturbance of sleep and growth, as measured by a 4-point scale to evaluate these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetics study, in which the patients-Demographs were comparable with the general seasonal allergitis -population was comparable to 4% of patients a higher concentration of Desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no vacant points for a clinical-relevant cumulation after daily use of Desloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days before.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloratadadenzyme was not yet identified, so that interaction with other medicines will not be excluded completely.</seg>
<seg id="1758">Desloratadinhibits in vivo not CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the medicine CYP2D6 does not inhibits and neither a substrate even a inhibitor of the P-glycoprotone.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dosisstudy with Desloratadin in a dose of 7.5 mg, meals (fateful, calorie rich breakfast) do not look forward to the availability of Desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The preclinical trials performed with Desloratadin and Loratadin in a comparable degree of exposure of Desloratadin, no qualitative or quantitative differences with respect to toxicatadin and of Loratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Based on conventional studies on security harmacology, toxicity at repeated gift, genotoxicity and to reproductive acid the preclinical data with Desloratadin do not recognize any special hazards for human beings.</seg>

<seg id="1763">Aerius can be taken independently of meals to reduce the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic Rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The prescription doctor should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under 2 years are caused by an infection (see section 4.4) and that no data have to support a treatment of infectious Rhinitis with Aerius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to exclusion from upper respiratory disturbances or anatomical anomalies should play the anamnese, physical examination and respective laboratory and skin analyses.</seg>
<seg id="1766">About 6% of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metabolic Desloratadin limited and experienced a higher subtle load (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of Aerius syrup with children aged between 2 and 11 years old metabolic, is identical to the children which are normal metabolic.</seg>
<seg id="1768">This medicinal product contains Saccharose and sorbitol; therefore, patients with inherent problems of a fructose-intolerance, glucose-Galactose absorption shemic or a Saccharase-insufficiency should not take this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1769">Clinically relevant interactions were detected within clinical trials with Aerius tablets, where Erythromycin or Ketoconazol was administered additionally (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1770">In a clinical pharmacological study, ingestion of aperius tablets and alcohol is not inferior to the performance of alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1771">The total hardness of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the Aerius Sirup group similar to the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="1772">In clinical trials with adults and adolescents in different indications, including allergic Rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, at the recommended dose, 3% more adverse events were reported in patients with Aerius when treated with placebo.</seg>

<seg id="1893">In June 2008 Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics S.r.l. officially announced that the company receives its decision on approval for the placing of Aflunov for the prevention of the aviary H5N1-influenza in adults and older people.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used in adults and elderly people for protection against influenza, caused by the strain (type) H5N1 of influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special kind of vaccine, which may cause a future pandemic in front of a trunk of influenza.</seg>
<seg id="1896">An influenza pandemic breaks out, when a new tribe of the flu virus resurns, which can easily spread from man to humans, because people still have no immunity (no protection).</seg>
<seg id="1897">Pursuant to the vaccination of the vaccination, the immune system detects the parts of the flu virus as "body foreign" and forms antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">This helps the immune system in the position to form a contact with a Grippevirus of this Stamms faster antibody.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Afterwards, the membrane cover of the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface, which detects the human body as a body-state), purified and used as a part of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out in accordance with the "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">As a result, the scope of clinical data base was not sufficient for assessing the safety of vaccination of vaccines required to meet the requirements of the EMEA (EMEA) guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Should you take part in a clinical study and require further information on your treatment, please contact your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="1903">If you desire more information regarding the recommendations of CHMP, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="1904">It is applied in combination with other antiviral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), which affects the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients who cannot swallow the capsules, the genase can not be used as a solution, but this can not be taken together with Ritonavir because the safety of this combination has not been investigated.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Agenase should be deferred only then if the doctor has examined which antiviral medicines of the patient previously applied, and the likelihood of medicines that the virus is being applied to the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily, taken along with twice a day 100 mg of Ritonavir and with other antiviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1908">In children between four and 12 years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of Agenase is aimed at body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">Agenase reduces the HIV-quantity in blood in combination with other antiviral medicines in the blood and maintains it at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">AIDS does not cure diseases, but can harm the damage of the immune system and that the development of AIDS associated infections and diseases are delayed.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenase was examined in combination with other antiviral medicines, but without Ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults, previously untreated previously with proteasants.</seg>
<seg id="1912">With low-resolution Ritonavir increased drug Agenase, with 206 adults, previously reported protease inhibitor was compared with other protectors.</seg>
<seg id="1913">Major indexes for efficacy was the proportion of patients with not detectable concentrations of HIV in the blood (virusload) or the change of viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with patients who had previously taken no protease inhibitor, after 48 weeks of under Agenase, more patients had a viral load below 400 copies / ml than under Placebo, but Agenase was less effective than indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenase had also reduced the virusload, but with the children who had been treated with proteasants earlier, only very few to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults who had been treated with protease inhibitor, the viral load was just as effective after 16 weeks treatment as well as other protease inhibitor:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other protease inhibitor, it came under Agenase to a stronger waste of the virusload after four weeks as in the patient who continued to increase their previous proteins:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common adverse events of Agenase (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headache, diarrhoea (diarrhea), nausea (nausea), nausea (nausea), vomiting, rash and Fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenase may not be applied to patients who may be insensitive (allergic) against Ambavir or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Agenase may also be applied to patients, the Johanniskraut (a vegetable preparation for the treatment of depression) or medicinal products, the same as Agenase, and in high concentrations in the blood of health, are taken.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines in patients who use Agenase, the risk of a lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of body fat), an osteonecrose (extinction of bone tissue) or a immune response (symptoms of infection that caused by changing immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">At the conclusion that the advantages of Agenase came in combination with other antiretroviral medicines in combination with other antiretroviral medicines in combination with other antiretroviral medicines referred to HIV-1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic amplifier Ritonavir, but the Committee set firmly that the use of Agenase in combination with Ritonavir in patients who previously have not been previously reported protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1924">Agenase was originally approved under "extraordinary circumstances, since the time of approval from scientific reasons only limited information.</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000 the European Commission granted the Glaxo Group Limited approval for placing an amperate of Agenase in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Agenase is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of HIV-1 infected, protease inhibitor (PI) previously treated adults and children from 4 years.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Usually, Agenase capsules should be administered to pharmacokinetical Boogie of Ambavir with low doses of Ritonavir (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of Ambavir should be applied to the individual viral resistance of the patients and the pre-line treatment (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bio availability of Ambavir as a solution to intake is 14% less than one capsule; therefore, Agenase capsules and solution are not interchangeable on a milligrams per milligram basis (see paragraph 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenase capsules is 600 mg of Ambavir twice daily with 100 mg itonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenase capsules are applied without the addition of Ritonavir (Boogie), higher doses must be applied to Agenase (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenase capsules is 20 mg of Ambavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines that should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">Pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of agenase in combination with low doses of Ritonavir or other protections were not examined in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years, due to the absence of data for unctuality and effectiveness (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of Agenase capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with heavy liver dysfunction at 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The simultaneous use of patients with mild or moderate liver function should be treated with severe liver function in patients with severe liver function (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Agenase may not be given simultaneously with drugs which have a low therapeutic width and also substrate of the cytochrome P450-Isoenzyms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Vegetable supplements, the Johanniskraut (hypericum penetrating) must not be applied because of the risk of reducing plasma concentration and a reduced therapeutic effect of Ambavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be noted that Agenase or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a healing of HIV infection, and that it also continues to develop opportunist infections or other complications of a HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The present antiretroviral therapy, including the treatment with Agenase, prevents the risk of transmission from HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Usually, apple capsules should be applied together with low doses of Ritonavir and combined with other antiretroviral medicines (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients who suffer chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral combination therapy, have an increased risk for heavy liver effects associated with potentially fatal course.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the case of simultaneous tiviral Treatment of hepatitis B or C, please refer to the technical information of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with existing reduced liver function including chronic hepatitis hepatitis indicate an increased frequency of liver function under a antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous use of Agenase and Ritonavir with Fluticason or other glucose coids, which are to be changed via CYP3A4, it is not recommended that the possible use of a treatment is the risk of systemic coricoseroider effects including Morbus Cushing and Suppression of the adoration function (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the deterioration of the HMG Coa Reductase-Hemmer Lovastatin and Simvastatin is strongly recommended by CYP3A4, a simultaneous administration of Agenase with Lovastatin and Simvastatin is not recommended because of the increased risk of Myopathic including Rhabdomyolyssen.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines that may cause severe or life-threatening side effects like Carbamazepin, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under the monitoring of the International normalised ratio), methods to determine the concentration of active concentration.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients who use this medicine at the same time, agenase may be less effective because of reduced plasma tiles (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interaction with Ambavir, the effectiveness of hormonal contrast can be changed, however, the information is not sufficient to appreciate the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">When methadon is given at the same time with Ambavir, the patients should therefore be monitored to Opiatentssymome, especially if it is also given low doses of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Due to the possible risk of toxicity, due to the high propylene glycol in the Agenase solution, this gut form is contra-indexed among children under the age of four years and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Generic-genase should be set to duration 5 if a skin rash of systemic or allergic symptoms are accompanied or the mucous membranes are involved (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">In patients who received antiretroviral therapy, including protease inhibitor, was reported about the occurrence of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia or an expression of an existing type of diabetes mellitus.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other diseases associated with drugs, associated with the development of a diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and with pharmaceutical-dependent factors such as a longer lasting antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1956">In hymiles patients (type A and B), which were treated with protectors, reports on an increase of bleeding including the spontaneous cutaneous hematoma and hemmarthrosen.</seg>
<seg id="1957">With HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect, a anti-retroviral combination therapy (ART) can develop a inflammatory reaction to the symbol or residual opportunist infections which leads to severe clinical state or deterioration of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although a multi-factorial equestology is accepted (including use of corticeroids, alcohol consumption, heavy immunisation, higher Body-Mass-Index), were reported cases of osteonecrose in patients with advanced HIV-disease and / or long-term application of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 Substrate with low therapeutic width Agenase may not be given simultaneously with drugs which have a low therapeutic width and also substrate of the cytochrome P450-Isoenzyms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 Substrate with low therapeutic width Agenase with Ritonavir cannot be used together with drugs which are mainly exchanged via CYP2D6 and are used for increased plasma tiles with serious and / or life-threatening effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% reduction in the AUC of Ambavir that can lead to a virological decor and can lead to a resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">During an attempt to compensate the lowest plasma tiles by a dose increase of other protease inhibitors in combination with Ritonavir, very often undesirable effects of the liver were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1963">Johanniskraut (hypericum penetrating) The serum levels of detoncar can be humbled by the simultaneous use of vegetable zucchini with Johanniskraut (hypericum penetrating).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient takes place in the Johanniskraut are the amber mirror and, if possible, add the Virusload and add the currant.</seg>
<seg id="1965">A dose customization for one of the drugs is not required if Nelfinavir is administered together with Ambavir (see also Eppirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increase, when Citonavir (100 mg twice daily), when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) is administered in combination with Ambavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials, doses of 600 mg of amplitudes have been applied twice daily and raitonavir 100 mg twice daily to prove the effectiveness and unthinkable of this treatment schematic.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% lower when Ambavir (750 mg twice daily) is administered in combination with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of Ambavir in plasma, which were obtained from Ambra (600 mg twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir twice daily), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than if Ambavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1970">A dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Ambavir and Kaletra can not be given, however, it is recommended, however, it is not known, because the effectiveness and unthinkable of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">There was no pharmacokinetical study on the use of Agenase in combination with didanosin combination, however, is recommended that the revenues of Didanosin and Agenase are at least one hour apart (see Antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, in combination with Ambavir (600 mg twice daily) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) no dose adjustments required.</seg>
<seg id="1973">Treatment with egg irence in combination with Ambavir and saquinavir is not recommended since the exposure of both protease inhibitor would be low.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of Nevirapin to other protease inhibitor and existing limited data can be avoided that Nevirapin possibly reduces the serum concentration of Ambavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If this medication should be used simultaneously, be careful because Delavirdin due to the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plasma level could be less effective.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If this medicine is used together, be careful; a thorough clinical and virological surveillance should be made, since a precise forecasting of the effect of Amber avir and Ritonavir is hard to be hard.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous administration of Ambavir and Ributin resulted in an increase in the Plasmacondensation (AUC) of Riyutin by 193%, resulting in a rise in rift-related side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons, ripenutin combined with Agenase, is advisable to reduce the dose of ripenutto at least half of recommended dose, although there are no clinical data available.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetical studies with Agenase in combination with erythromycin were not performed, but the plasma tiles of both drugs could be increased in case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg Fosampos and 100 mg penitoncar with 200 mg Ketoconazole led to 2.69fold daily compared to the value that was observed after 200 mg Ketoconazol once daily with no simultaneous use of Fosampos with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines that are listed below are also substrate, inhibitor or inductors of CYP3A4, if they are applied together with Agenase, possibly to interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be monitored by toxic reactions, which are connected to these drugs, if they are applied in combination with Agenase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on other protease inhibitor, it is advisable that antacids should not be taken at the same time as Agenase, as there can be resorption disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous use of antivultures, known as the enzyme inductors (phenytoin, phenobarbital, Carbamazepin), with Ambcar can lead to a humilient of the plasma tiles of Ambavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">The serum concentration of calcium plugs such as Amlodipin, diode pin, rodipin, nidipin, nidipin, nidipin, nidipin, pine and deapamil can be increased from 10 by Ambavir, which may increase the activity and toxicity of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The simultaneous intake of agenase can increase considerably and increase plasma concentrations in combination with PDE5 inhibitors in connection side effects including hypotomy, visionaries and priapism (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study conducted at Ritonavir 100 mg capsules twice daily with 50 µg of fluorticasonpropionat intranasal (4 times daily), while the endogenous Kortisol increased by about 86% (90% reduction interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous gift of Agenase with Ritonavir is not recommended together with these Glukokorchiids, unless the possible use of a treatment is the risk of systemic acid-eroider effects (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">With HMG-Coa Reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose deterioration is strongly influenced by CYP3A4, there are projected enhancing the plasma tiles to the simultaneous administration of Agenase.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since plasma-level increases of these HMG Coa reductase inhibitors to Myopathy, including a Reign domyolysis, the combined use of these drugs is not recommended at Ambavir.</seg>
<seg id="1991">It is recommended for frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations as a stabilization of mirrors, as the plasma concentration of Cyclosporin, Rapamycin and Tacrolimus may be increased for the benefit of amplitudes (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, Agenase may not be applied together with an orally recorded Midazolam (see section 4.3) while maintaining Agenase application with parenteral Midazolam.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for simultaneous use of parenteral Midazolam with other protectors indicate a possible increase in plasma tiles from Midazolam around 3 to 4 feet.</seg>
<seg id="1994">When methadon is administered together with Ambavir, the patients should therefore be monitored to Opiatentssymome, especially if it is also given low doses of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Because of the low distortion of historical comparability, there is currently no recommendation to adjust how Amblown up is administered at the same time with methadon.</seg>
<seg id="1996">For simultaneous treatment of warfarin or other orical antibodies with Agenase, a increased control of INR (International normalised ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of a weak or reinforcement of the antithrombotic effect (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of Ritonavir on hormonal contrast agent is not predictable, hence alternative methods for recipient prevention is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">A careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended for the benefit of asive bladder (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">This medication may only be used during pregnancy only after careful usage of the possible user for the mother in comparison with the possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">In the milk activated rats, Ambavir-related substances have been detected, but it is not known whether Ambavir is overflowing into breast milk.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproductive study of damaging rats who was administered by the feeding of Ambavir in the uterus until the end of the breastfeeding was reduced to 12 body weight during the breastfeeding time.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The further development of rearing, including fertility and reproductive capacity was not impaired by the administration of Ambavir.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The disturbability of Agenase was studied in adults and children from 4 years in combination with various other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2004">The side effects associated with the Agenase treatment were slightly up to moderate, coming up early and led to the treatment breakdown.</seg>
<seg id="2005">In many of these events it is not clarified, whether they are related to the use of Agenase or another simultaneously on HIV treatment, or whether they are a result of the underunderdisease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the side-mentioned side effects originate from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which with protections of non-treated patients received 1200 mg of Agenase twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (degree 2 to 4), which were utilised by the investigator as described in connection with the study medication, and at more than 1% of patients, as well as under the treatment of treatment (degree 3 to 4).</seg>
<seg id="2008">The antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with HIV patients (lipodystrophy) with HIV-patients, including a loss of peripheral fat tissue, increased intraocular and visceral fatty tissues, hypertrophy of the breasts and dorsovicervical fat collection (Stiffles).</seg>
<seg id="2009">At 113 antiretroviral non-treated people who were treated with Ambvudin / Zidovudin, a medium term of 36 weeks, was observed only one case (Stiffles) (&lt; 1%).</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the study PROAB 3006 patients came under Ambavir 7 cases (3%) in comparison to 27 cases (11%) in 241 patients under indinavir, in combination with various NRTIs over a medium term of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0.001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Skin envelopes were normally slightly up to moderate, erythematous or maculopapult nature, with or without Juckreiz and stood spontaneously during the second treatment week, and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks, without the treatment with Ambavir had to be canceled.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Osteoncrosis reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV-disease or long-term application of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">In case of HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect, a anti-retroviral combination therapy (ART) can develop a inflammatory reaction to the symbol or residual opportunist infections (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">With PI pre-treated patients who received 600 mg of Agenase twice daily, were similar and frequency of side effects (degree 2 to 4) and laboratory changes (degree 2 to 4) and laboratory Changes (Grade 3 and 4) were observed, an exception of the triglyceride and CPK values, which received with low glyceried Ritonavir, extremely common.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of an overdosage the patient is observed on the signs of an intoxication (see section 4.8), if necessary, necessary support measures are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Ambavir binds to the active centre of HIV-1 protease and prevents the processionof viral gag- and gag polo polyproteinment levels with the result of a formation unirritated, not infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of Ambavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was investigated both acute and chronic lymphocyberic cell lines (MT-4, Cem-CCRF, H9) as well as peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% Hemp concentration (IC50) of Ambavir is increased in the range from 0,012 to 0.08 µM when acute cells and is 0,41 µM when diagnosed in chronic cells.</seg>
<seg id="2019">The connection between the activity of Ambavir against HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibitors of HIV-1 replication on human beings are not yet defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretroviral non-treated patients with the currently approved Fosampos / Ritonavir doses have been observed - as with other Ritonavir zooking treatment schemas with proteasant inhibitors - the mutations described only rarely.</seg>
<seg id="2021">At sixteen years of 434 antiretroviral not treated patients who received 700mg Fosampos with 100mg of Ritonavir twice daily in the study ESS100732, a virological failure could be examined up to week 48, with 14 isolates genotypically.</seg>
<seg id="2022">Genotypical analysis of the isolate of 13 of 14 children, with which a virological failure in the 59 was included, with proteasiness of non-treated patients showed resistance pattern, which were similar to those in adults.</seg>

<seg id="2024">In the study APV30003 and its extension APV30005 (700 mg Fosampos / 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily: n = 107) participated in patients with four-rological failures over 96 weeks, the following protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="2025">On genotypical resistance-based analysis of genotypic interpretation systems can be applied to estimation of Ambavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitor-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosampos / Ritonavir defined resistance as the presence of mutations V32I + 147A / V / W / V, I84V and L90M in conjunction with an increased phenomenal resistance to Fosampos with Ritonavir as well as a reduced probability of a virological response (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">Conclusions with regard to the relevance of certain mutations or mutation model can be subject to additional data, and it is recommended to always take the current interpretation systems for analysis of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Based on phenotypical resistance tests, clinically validated phenomena systems can be used in connection with genotypical data for estimation of Ambavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies to distribute the diagnostic resistance tests carried out clinically-phenotypical Cut-offs (partition points) for FPV / RTV, which can be applied to interpretation of a resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four with a reduced sensitivity against Ambavir associated genetically creates a certain cross-resistant against Ritonavir, the sensitivity against Indinavir, Nelfinavir and saquinavir remains generally preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data available to the cross-resistance of Ambavir and other Protected Materials for all 4 Fosampos Resistor Resisters, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">Based on five-five antiretroviral were not pre-treated patients with which a resistance against Lopinavir / Ritonavir (one of 25 isolates), injunavir / Ritonavir (three out of 24 isolates), Saquinavir (three of 24 isolates) and Tipranavir / Ritonavir (four out of 24 isolates).</seg>
<seg id="2033">In reverse, Ambavir retains its activity against some other protease inhibitors; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent upon the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Early demolition of a failing therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of nuts in the limits which can be applied to the subsequent treatment of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The validity of the efficacy of Agenase in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO30017, a randomised open study, together with Ritonavir (NRTI) or a standard of therapy (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, mainly with a lower Ritonavir "geboostert."</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred and sixty (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity compared to Agenase, at least another PI and at least one NRTI were included in the substudy A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis presented the non-perplexity of APV / Ritonavir compared to the time adjusted average change (AAUCMB) in the plasma load (AAUCMB) in the plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-legenal fluctuation of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The cover of the efficacy of unintentional Agenase is based on two uncontrolled trials with a total of 288 HIV-infected children aged between 2 and 18 years, of which 152 were treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, Agenase Solution were applied twice daily, 20 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">No low-dose ritonvir was given at the same time; the majority of the patients treated with PI had previously treated at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, about 25% of the patients included a plasma-HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml for an median increase in CD4 cells of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared with the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="2042">19 Based on these data should be considered to be considered to be considered to be considered for the benefit of "unused" Agenase "with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2043">After oral administration, the mean duration (Tmax) to the maximum serum concentration of Ambavir is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increase when Citonavir (100 mg twice daily) is administered together with Ambavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of Ambavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease of AUC but has no effect on the concentration of Ambavir 12 hours after dosing (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore the minimum concentration in the Steady state (Cmin, ss) was unaffected by the food intake, although the simultaneous food intake affects the magnitude and rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l (6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg) and can close to a large distribution volume as well as a residual penetration of Ambavir from the blood flow in the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the concentration of active substances in plasma, although the amount of unbonito blown up, representing the active proportion, probably unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of unused amperavir remain constant, the percentage of free active components fluctuates during the dosing interval at the Steady-state concentration in the Steady-State, until Cmin, ss until Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore we need to modify the CYP3A4 induced or inhibitions or a substrate of CYP3A4 to be careful when they are given at the same time with Agenase (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift from Agenase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily, leads to a similar daily ambulance exposure such as adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Ambavir is 14% less bio-available as from the capsules; therefore Agenase solution and Agenase capsules are not interchangeable on a millionaire basis.</seg>
<seg id="2053">Also the renal cleance of Ritonavir neglegible, therefore the effect of a renal function should be low to elimination of Ambavir and Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These treatment schemes lead to Ambavir plasma samples which are treated to healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of Ambavir twice daily without simultaneous administration of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies for cancinogenicity in mice and rats, with male animals benigne hepatoculary Adenome with dosages on which the 2.0 times (mice) or 3.8- fold (rat) of exposure to humans, after twice daily gift of 1200 mg of Amblown avir.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of hepatoculars Adenome and Karzinome has not been clarified and the relevance of these observed effects for human beings is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">However, out of this occupational exposure data on humans, both clinical trials as well as from the therapeutic application, however, there were little evidence for accepting a clinical relevance of these findings.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of in-vivo- and in-vitro non-vitro genetic tests, the bacterial reverse test test, microcore test to rats and chromosome aberratic test of human peripheral lymphocytes included was Ambavir neither mutagenoxic.</seg>
<seg id="2059">These liver toxicity can be monitored and detected in clinical everyday life through measurement of AST, ALT and the activity of alkaline phosphatase.</seg>
<seg id="2060">So far in clinical trials no significant liver toxicity in patients were observed, neither during the administration of Agenase even after the end of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Studies on toxicity in maiden who were treated at the age of 4 days showed a high mortality in the control of bovine animals as well as with the Ambavir-animals.</seg>
<seg id="2062">With an systemic plasma exposition which was significantly below (rabbits) or not significantly higher (rats) than the expected exposure of therapeutic dosage in humans, however, a number of slight changes including thymuselongation and a significant skeleton changes were observed, which point to a delayed development.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24 If Agenase capsules are applied without the addition of Ritonavir (Boogie), higher doses must be applied to Agenase (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for Agenase capsules is 20 mg of Ambavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines that should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2065">The concurrent application is supposed to involve patients with weak or slight liver function, in patients with severe liver function, it is contra-indexed (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2066">26 For some medicines that may cause severe or life-threatening side effects like Carbamazepin, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under the monitoring of the International normalised ratio), methods to determine the concentration of active concentration.</seg>

<seg id="2233">The effectiveness of Imiquimod could not be shown in these studies in the specified dosages (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks</seg>
<seg id="2234">A minimal systemic intake of the 5% Imiquimod compound due to the skin of 58 patients with aktinic keratosis was observed during the three times weekly application during 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">Serum samples at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1, 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face of the face (12.5 mg, 1 bag) and at the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bags).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The calculated half-life time was about 10times higher than the 2-hour half-life after the subcutaneous application in a previous study; this indicates an extended retention of the disease in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Data to systemic exposure showed that the absorption of Imiquimod was low upon MC-treated skin from patients at the age of 6-12 years and comparable to healthy adults and adults with aktintinent keratosis or superfluent basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four-month study on the reinforcement toxicity at the rat (cans of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg), resulted in significantly reduced body weight and elevated milz weight; a long period of four months showed no similar effects during the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study on carcinogenicity in mice about three days per week induced no tumors at the application point.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The corresponding mechanism is not known, but since Imiquimod is only a small systemic absorption from the human skin and not mutagenic, is a risk of human beings because of the systemic exposition rather low.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The tumours appeared in the group of mice, which was treated with the real-free cream, formerly known as in greater number than in the control group with low UVR.</seg>

<seg id="2277">In the study, mainly the safety of the pharmaceutical was investigated, however, its effectiveness was measured (by its effect in relation to the reduction of GAG concentrations in urine and in relation to the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under five years, Aldurazyme, the GAG concentrations in urine, around 60%, and half of the children treated a normal liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common adverse events of Aldurazyme in patients at the age of over five years (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headache, osteoathy (joint pain), back pain, pain in limbs (in hands and feet), heat-feeling, fever and reaction at the infusion centre.</seg>

<seg id="2283">The manufacturers of Aldurazyme is examined patients who observe Aldurazyme as regards reactions to the infusion and development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission granted the Genzyme Europe company approval for placing the market on the market of Aldurazyme throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a combinant shaped form of the human α-L-Iduronidase and is produced using recombinant DNA technology using Cho-mamier cell cultures (Chinese Hamster Oops, Eierfloor of the Chinese government).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indexed in patients with secured diagnosis of a Muthysacchario I (MPS I, α-L-Iduronidase deficiency) in order to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">Treatment with Aldurazyme should take place by a physician, experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other heredal metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient can tolerate this every 15 minutes on a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in adults over 65 years has not been determined, and for these patients no dosing scheme can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver insufficiency is not determined, and for these patients no dosing scheme can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with Aldurazyme may develop infusions, defined as any related tribution, which occurs during the infusion or until the end of the infusion-date (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, these patients should continue to remain tightly superbly monitored, and the infusion of aldurazyme should only be made available in a reasonable clinical environment, where reinviting facilities for medical emergencies are available immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 study, almost all patients IgG antibodies are formed against Laronidase, usually within 3 months of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of infusions, must be treated with care of Aldurazyme with caution (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">As little experience regarding the recovery of treatment after a longer interruption, must be careful because of the theoretically increased risk reaction according to a interruption of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before the beginning of the infusion with medications (Antihistamine and / or Antipyanka) to minimize the potential occurrence of infusions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of slight or moderate infusions, treatment with Antihistamine and Paracetamol / Ibuprofen should be considered and / or a reduction in infusion rate at half of the infusion rate, in which the reaction is occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of a single, heavy infusions, the infusion must be stopped until the symptoms are brought to decline, a treatment with Antihistamine and Paracetamol / Ibuprofen.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion rate can be resumed at 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate when the response occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (Antihistamine and Paracetamol / Ibuprofen and / or Corticosteroids) as well as a reduction in infusion rate at 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate, which occurred in the past reaction.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be used simultaneously with chloroquin or procain, because a potential risk of interference with intracellular photo of Laronidase exists.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experiments did not allow direct or indirect harmful effects to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since no data to newborn, which were exponated opposite Laronidase, the breast milk is recommended, not recommended during treatment with Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">The adverse reactions were entered in clinical trials which were observed in 53% of patients in the Phase 3 study (treatment duration up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study included in children under 5 years (treatment duration up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Undesirable drugs interactions in connection with Aldurazyme, which were observed during Phase 3, or older at a total treatment duration of up to 4 years, are often seen in the following table: very common (≥ 1 / 10); frequently (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related involvement of the upper respiratory tracts and lungs in the history came out heavy reactions, including Bronchospasmus, respiratory diseases and facial (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children unwanted pharmaceuticals in connection with Aldurazyme, which were reported in a total of 20 patients with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5, with mainly severe contamination and a duration of treatment up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">In most cases we came to a Serconversion within 3 months after the treatment of a serum version, whereby it was mostly seen in the patients at the age of 5 (average after 26 days compared to 45 days at the age of 5 and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Until the end of the Phase 3 study (or up to a premature extinction from the study) were detected at 13 / 45 patients without radioimmunophthalate (RIP) Assay, monoclonal antibody, including 3 patients who never came to Seroconversion.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with missing to the low-capital mirror, a resilient reduction in GAG mirrels in Harn, while in patients with high antibody titres was able to set a variable reduction of GAG in harn.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 study and one in the Phase 2 study) showed an marginal effect on enzymatic Laronidase- activity in vitro that seemed to affect the clinical efficacy and / or the reduction of GAG in Harn.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies appeared not in connection with the incidence of unwanted medicines, even when the occurrence of unwanted medicines are typically involved with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reasons for the enzymes of enzymes is in one for the Hydrolyse of the Substrate Substrate and preventing a further accumulation in the enact of enzymes.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion, Laronidase is quickly removed from the cycle and of cells into the lysososomes, most likely above men-6-phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">Safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme were included in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study in 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study, the majority of patients were treated by the mean phenotype and only one patient demonstrated the heavy phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had an research expirational volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for efficacy were the percentage change of the equivalent FEV and the absolute walk in the 6-minute walk.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were subsequently recruited for an open label extension study, where they received another 3.5 years (182 weeks) every week 100 E / kg Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, the patients treated with Aldurazyme treated patients to improve lung function and the ability to use in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">In the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintaining this effects of up to 208 weeks in derAldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and of 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group, as seen from the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease in the percentage of the percentage of FEV is not significantly significantly and the absolute lung-volumes increased further proportionally in height-growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with a hepatomic normality of treatment 22 (85%), until the end of the study was a normal liver size.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks, a clear trash of the GAG mirror in Harn (µg / mg of creatinin) was determined, which remained constant until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">Regarding the heterogeneous disease manifolds among patients who summarizes clinically significant changes for five efficacy variable (58%) in the 6-minute test, motion range in 26 patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a deterioration of 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">An open phase 2 study was conducted in which mainly the security and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme was studied at 20 patients, who were at the time of their recording into the study below 5 years of age (16 patients with severe deterioration form and 4 with the middle course form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosing was increased to 200 E / kg for increased GAG- mirror in the harn in the last 26 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a size increase (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) were detected after the Z-score for this age group The younger patients with severe deterioration form (&lt; 2,5 years) and all 4 patients with the mean decrease form, whereas in the older patients were only limited, or even there were no progress in cognitive development.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study, investigations into the dynamic effects of various Aldurazyme dosing schematics were carried out at the GAG mirror in the harn, the liver volume and the 6-minute test test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosing scheme with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks can be able to display difficulties with weekly infusion, but it is not proven that the long-term clinical efficacy of these two dosing schemes is equivalent to the same.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will evaluate all new information that will be available annually, and if necessary, the summary of the characteristics of the pharmaceutical will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2334">The pharmacokinetical profile in patients at the age of 5 was similar to those affected by older and fewer affected patients.</seg>

<seg id="2385">Clinical studies shows no indication that in patients at the age of 65 years or over, in comparison to patients aged 65 years, an increased risk of increased risks.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to non-sufficient data for infertility and effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="2387">Clinical trials were not necessary in patients with a creatinin-Clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min does not need dose adjustments required for all patients with recommended dose adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data base in patients with a creatinine cleance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore the application is not recommended (see section 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="2390">Patients need to be monitored in patients with regard to the bone marker and pemetry may not be given to patients before their absolute neutrophilation count again reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the trombo- cyte count once again reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">A dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of absolute neutrophild count and maximum non-hematological toxicity, as they were observed in the previous treatment cycles - see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction of degrees 3 / 4 hematological and nichthological toxicity, such as Neutropenie, febrile Neutropenie and infection with degree 3 / 4 Neutropenie was administered if a pre-treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 was taken.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients treated with Pemetized patients are required to apply folic acid and vitamin B12 as a prophy- lactate measure to treat toxicity (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to medium cardiac insufficiency (NSAIDs) such as Ibuprofen and acetylsali- cylacid (&gt; 1,3 g daily) must be avoided for at least 2 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and minimalism (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients who are provided for a therapy with Pemetrexed is necessary to avoid NSAIDs with long half-life for at least 5 days prior to the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with Pemeterxed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients who occurred these events, had the corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of renal events, including dehydration, existing blueprint or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Therefore, in patients with clinically significant liquid manage- collection in transcellular room a draining of the ergonomics of the pemetry treatment should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 serious cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events were reported in clinical trials with pemeteries occasionally, when this drug was usually administered in combination with another Cytotoxic substance.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, the simultaneous use of attenued living dimmer (except yelloweber, these vaccination is not recommended (see section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>

<seg id="2402">Therefore caution is careful when patients with normal kidney function (creatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of NSAIDs or Ace- tylsalicylic acid in high dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen) or acetylsalicyl- acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy, the day of therapy and minimalism (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since there are no data regarding the interaction potential with NSAIDs with long half-life such as Piro- xicam or Rofecoxib, the simultaneous use of Pemetry should be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with Pemetre- xed.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The large intra-individual variability of the transmission status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral antibodies and antineoplastic chemotherapy requires an increased surveillance frequency of INR (International normalised ratio) when the decision was taken to treat patients with orical antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for the use of Pemetrexed at pregnant while, but as with ande- antimetabolites are expected in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Pemetreboxed should not be applied during pregnancy, except if necessary, and after careful separation of the usefulness for the mother and risk for the Fötus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">Since the possibility of an irreversible damage to reproductive capacity should be referred by Pemetrexed, men should be advised before the treatment course, advice regarding the sperm count.</seg>

<seg id="2526">Animal experiments showed no direct or indirect effect on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal nature and depend on the pharmacological effect of the pharmaceutical, since absorption of recorded fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">The gastrointestinal effects were obtained from clinical trials with orlistat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally lightweight and temporarily.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The Frequencies are defined as follows: very frequent (≥ 1 / 10, &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000) and very rare (&lt; 1 / 10,000), not known (frequency on the basis of available data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The frequency of the known side effects reported after the introduction of orlistat is not known, since these events were voluntarily reported by a population of uncertain size.</seg>
<seg id="2531">+ It is plausible that treatment with alli can lead to conversion in terms of possible or actual gastrointestinal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Single doses of 800 mg orlistat and multiple outlets from up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days to normal and overweight people, without that significant clinical findings occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2533">In the majority of the cases reported by Orlistat-overdozation, either side effects or similar side effects were reported either with the recommended dose of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on research and animal, based on research and animal can be assumed by a fast withdrawal of any systemic effects that are attributable to livex properties of orlistat.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloxi is used for chemotherapies that are strong triggers for nausea and vomiting (such as Cisplatin), as well as chemotherapies, the moderate triggers for nausea and vomiting are (such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The effectiveness of Aloxi can be increased by the additional gift of a Corticosteroids (a medicinal that can be used as anti-emetry).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The application for patients under 18 years of age is not recommended since the effects in this age group do not lie enough information.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active ingredient produces the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT, also known as serotonin), on the receptors in the intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was studied in three main studies at 1 842 adults who received chemotherapy, strong or moderate triggers for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">For chemotherapies, the strong triggers for nausea and vomiting are, 59% of the patients who were treated with Aloxi were no vomiting (132 from 223), compared to 57% of patients treated with Ondansetron patients (126 from 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">For chemotherapies, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting, 81% of patients who were treated with Aloxi were not getting a vomiting (153 of 189), compared to 69% of patients treated with Ondansetron patients (127 from 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">With a comparison of Dolassetron these values are 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission granted the Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals company, a approval for the placing of Aloxi in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indexed: for prevention of acute nausea and vomiting for strongly emetoed chemotherapy due to cancer prevention and prevention of nausea and vomiting for moderate chemotherapy due to cancer disease.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The efficacy of Aloxi to prevention of nausea and vomiting, which is induced by a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy, can be strengthened by adding one before the given Corticosteroids.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can extend the colon passage, patients should be monitored with amnesty observations or signs of a subacute Ileus after injection of tightening.</seg>
<seg id="2620">As with other 5HT3 antagonists, however, it is careful to extend the same gift of Palonosetron with medicines that extend the QT interval or in patients with which the QT interval is extended or extending to such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">Except in connection with any other chemotherapeutics, Aloxi is neither preventured nor used for the treatment of nausea and vomiting in the days after chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical trials, Palonosetron is not inhibited against tumours of five examined chemotherapeutics (Cisplatin, Cyclophosphamide, Cycloabine, doxorubicin and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study, no significant pharmacokinetical interaction between one-time intravenous dose of Palonosetron and a Steady-static concentration of Metoclopramids, of a CYP2D6 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In one of a population-based pharmacokinetical analysis revealed that the simultaneous gift of CYP2D6 Inhibitors (Amiodaron, Celectropy, Scoxetine, Scoxetine, Ritonavir, Sertralin and Terbinafin) had no significant impact on the Clearance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experiences for the application of Palonosetron in human pregnancies are not before, therefore Palonosetron should not be applied for pregnant women, unless it is necessary to treat the doctor as necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2626">Clinical trials were the most common with a dose of 250 micrograms (a total of 633 patients) which stood at least with aloxi in connection, headache (9%) and Obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of surplus relation reactions and reactions to the appointments (burning, hardening, complaints and pain) were reported in post marketing experiences.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage, similar measures showed undesirable events such as in the other dossier; there were no dose to be observed.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies were performed, however, due to the large distribution volume, a dialysis probably does not have any effective therapy with a Aloxi- overdosage.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies, a total of 1,132 patients were compared with ≤ 50 mg / m2 Cyclophosphamide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 doxorubic patients (half-time 4 hours) or 100 mg of Dolasetron (half-time: 7.3 hours), which was given to Day 1 without dexamethasian IV.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double-blind study, 667 patients who received a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazine and 250 or 750 micrograms of Palonosetron received patients who received 32 mg Ondansetron based on Day 1.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of studies with moderate-based chemotherapy and the study with strongly emetoed chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials for indication of chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of Palonosetron were comparable to blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including the corresponding effects of Ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">According to the findings of clinical studies, Palonosetron possesses the ability to block the Ionite's ventricular dearisation and to extend the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The objective of the study carried out in 221 healthy volunteers the evaluation of the EKG-effects of i.V. was administered by the Palonosetron in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After intravenous gift follow an initial decrease of plasma concentrations as a slow Elimination of the body with an average terminal block of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the area under the concentration time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally disproportionately in the entire dose area of 0,3- 90 μ g / kg.</seg>
<seg id="2638">After an intravenous gift of Palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses between day 1 and day 5 measured medium (± SD) increase in the Palonosetron plasma concentration at 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">From pharmacokinetical simulations that the peak was comparable with a daily intravenous gift of 0.25 mg of Palonosetron in 3 consecutive days (AUC0- ∞) comparable to after one-time intravenous administration of 0.75 mg; however, the Cmax was higher than 0.75 mg higher.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% will eliminate the kidneys and approximately 50% are converted into two primary Metabolism, which compared to Palonosetron in less than 1% of the antagonist effect on 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies on metabolic patients showed that CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 has been involved in the metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After a IV single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron, about 80% of the dose were found within 144 hours of urine, Palonosetron made as an unaltered active ingredient, made approximately 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After one-time intravenous bolster problem in healthy life was 173 ± 73 ml / min and renal cleance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Although in patients with severe liver function, the terminal elimination system and the average systemic exposure with Palonosetron increases, a reduction of the dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical trials, effects were observed only after expositions that are considered adequate over the maximum human therapeutic exposition which indicates a slight relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 Out of clinical trials prove that Palonosetron can block only in very high concentrations of Ionic channels, which can extend to the ventricular dearisation and repolarisation.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosetron (each dose corresponded to approximately 30 times of therapeutic exposure to humans), which were given daily over two years, resulted in a higher frequency of liver tumors, endocrine Neoplasms (in thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, side-nierenmark) and skin tumors, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but because of the used high doses and Aloxi is determined for one-time use, the relevance of these results will be minimal for humans.</seg>

<seg id="2671">After adjusting the treatment with Alpheon the disease was flammable in more patients than with the reference conditions; Alpheon had more adverse reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2672">In addition, the test carried out in the study carried out a immune response in the study (i.e. the body makes antibodies - special proteins - against the pharmaceuticals) not sufficiently validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It may be applied for the treatment of Impetigo (a crust-hermetic skin infection) and small inclassified Lazerations (Rissor / kerewounds), deplying and bent wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo is not used to treat infections, which have been proven or probably caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), because the alarm against this type of infections may not work.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be applied in patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under 18 years the surface must not exceed 2% of the body surface.</seg>

<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin-wounds, Altargo and Cefalexin similar response rates: if the results were taken together with skin wounds, about 90% of patients both groups were treated to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">However, in these two studies, however, Altargo was diagnosed in the treatment of wasteways (eitfully filled cavities in the body tissue) or of infections, which were detectable or probably by MRSA, is not effective enough.</seg>

<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission granted the Glaxo Group Ltd. a approval for the placing of Altargo throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with which no improvements should be considered within two to three days, should be considered once and an alternative therapy can be considered (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the case of a Sensizing or severe local Irritation by the application of Retapamulin Salbe, the treatment is broken carefully and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection are started.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin should not be applied to the treatment of infections with which MRSA is known as a pathogen, or assumed (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical studies with secondary-infected wounds the efficacy of retinamulin was induced into patients with infections which caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy is considered to be considered if after a 2- or 3-day treatment, no improvement or deterioration of the infected place will occur.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous use of retinamulin and other topical means on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous use of other topical medicines will not be recommended.</seg>

<seg id="2698">Action method Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance that is isolated by fermentation of Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly Pleurotus passeaganus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The action mechanism of Retapamulin is based on selective inhibitors of bacterial proteins through interaction in a specific binding point of the bacterial ribosom, which differs from the binding of other ribosomal antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data refer to that the Binder stelle ribosomales protein L3 is involved in the region of ribosomal P-binder and the peptidyltransferral centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">Using engagement to this binding point, Pleuromutiline inhibit the peptidyltransfer, partial P-binder and prevent the normal education of active 50s bosomaler subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">Should the basis of the local prevalence of resistance to the use of retinamulin should appear at least some infectivity forms, an advice should be infected by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in in-vitro activity of Retapamulin at S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates were resistant or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In the case of non-appealing on treatment at S.aureus, the presence of tribes with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>

<seg id="2728">After having received a vaccine, the immune system detects viruses and surface antigens than "strange" and creates antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same components as the vaccination of the Twinrix Children permitted since 1996 and has been permitted since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect the same diseases, however, Twinrix adults and Twinrix children are given as part of a three doses existing in three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix Adults contain identical ingredients, some of the data, which support the application of Twinrix adults, also used as a cover for the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indices for efficacy was the proportion of vaccinated children that had been developed a month after the last injections had developed a protective antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children, the vaccination of vaccines was compared with a six-month and a 12 month gap between the two injections.</seg>

<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of the protection of Ambirix was in a six-month long distance between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common adverse events of Ambirix (observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccination boxes) are headaches, appetite, pain on the injection of injection, mixing, harness (tiredness) as well as irritability.</seg>

<seg id="2880">Is Angiox for preventing blood clots in patients applied to one PCI, a higher dose is administered and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This may contribute to patients with Angina or heart attack for maintaining blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Approximately 14 000 patients participated in the study study on the treatment of ACS at allpoox for some gift or in combination with a glycoprotein-IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, another drug to prevent blood clots) with a conventional combination treatment with Heparin (another anti-Antioagulans) and a GPI.</seg>

<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of an allcertain Bolus gift of Angiox was not investigated and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value is shortened (ACT after 5 minutes) to less than 225 seconds, a second bolster amount should be 0.3 mg / kg / body weight.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values, the reconstituted and diluted medicinal products should be carefully mixed and administered intravenously to the Bolusdose.</seg>
<seg id="2899">As soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds, another monitoring is no longer required, provided, the 1.75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered right.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate kidney limitations (GFR 30-59 ml / min), the one PCI is treated (whether using bivalirmudin against ACS or not), a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used for the treatment of adults, adolescents and children from six years with diabetes, who need a treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is injected subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the upper thighs or the upper arm is administered as a continuous set with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to regulating glucose levels (sugar) in the blood, or that non-insulin can be processed.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin lulisin differs very slightly from Humaninsulin, and the change means that it works faster and a shorter active duration has as a short-effective human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was used in combination with a long-effective insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes, where the body could not produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In type 2 diabetes, where the insulin cannot be effected in the body, Apidra was examined in a study with 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indication for efficacy was the change of the concentration of the substance glycol hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that shows how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes, a decline of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) in comparison with a decline of 0.14% at insulin rate.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, the HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% for human normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra may not be applied to patients who are possibly insensitive (allergic) against insomlulisin or one of the other components, or in patients who suffer from a hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other drugs, which may vary on blood gluing tiles.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted the Association of Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH and approval for the placing of Apidra in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is either a subcutaneous injection, either in the area of abdominal surface, to apply or subcutaneous through continuous infusion in the area of abdominal cavity.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the reduced Gluconeogenesis and the lower insulin change, the insulin need to be reduced in patients with a limitation of the liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Each change of the effectiveness strength, the brand (Her- Steller), the insulin (normal, NPH, zinkdelayed, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or manufacturing method can draw a change of insulin requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 A inadequate dosage or disrupting of a treatment, especially in patients with an insulin-dependent diabetes, may lead to a hyperglycemia and diabetic Ketoazide; these states are potentially life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">Changing a patient to another insulin-type or insulin-insulin should be effected under stringent medical supervision and can make a change of dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The effect of a hypoglycaemia depends on the active profile of the insulin, and can therefore change at the change of treatment schemas.</seg>
<seg id="2983">To the substances that increase the blood sugar-sensitive activity and increase the tendency to hypoglyricots, include oral antidiabetic, disopyrillies, discotoxin, monoamine oxidation, pentoxifylline, propoxyphen, salicycles and sulphuramid antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, under the effect of sympatholytics, like betwideans, Clonidin, Guanethidin and spare parts, the symptoms of adrenergen counterweight is not weakened or missing.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experimental studies for reproductive elasticity showed no differences between Insu- linglulisin and Humaninsulin in relation to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, the birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insomlulisins occurs in human breast milk, but generally insulin is neither in breast milk, nor resorted after oral application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Below are the clinical trials listed in clinical trials, grouped according to system organic classes and follows after declining numbers of incidence (very often: ≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 10; rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10.000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10.000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10.000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10.000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000); not known (frequency based on the available ba- moose data).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Dry, cool, cool skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiety, unusual bleeding or weakness, confusion, concentration disorders, headache, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy Will be missed to continuously change the injector within the injection area, a lipodystrophy may occur in the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Heavy hypoglyre boxes with consciousness can be given thanks to an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucose (0.5 to 1 mg), which is given by a doctor or intravenous gift of glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After a glucose projection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the urgent matter for the heavy hypoglycaemia and similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin sugar reduces blood sugar level by stimulating the peripheral glucose absorption (especially due to skeletal musculature and fat) as well as the inhibition of glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that during subcutaneous mitotic membrane in the effects occurs quicker and the active time shorter is shorter than in hu- manem normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study of 18 male persons at the age of 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes, insomlulisin in therapeutic relevant dosing range from 0,075 to 0.15 E / kg, showed a proportional increase of gluing effect, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a proportional increase of glueing effect, exactly as Humaninsulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insomlulisin has twice as fast active effect as a normal human insulin and achieved the complete gluing effect for approximately 2 hours earlier than Humaninsulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">From the data was evident that during an application of insomlulisin 2 minutes before meal a comparable postprandial glycemic control is reached like with human normal interest ulin which is given 30 minutes before meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">Insomlulisin 2 minutes before meal, a better postprandial control was reached than with human normal insulin which was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin is turned 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal, there will be a similar glycemic control of such as human normal insulin, which is given 2 Mixed before the meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insomlulisin gift 2 minutes (GLULISIN: previously) before the meal compared to human normal insulin, which was given 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min) before the beginning of the meal (NORMAL - before) was given before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insomlulisin gift 15 minutes (GLULISIN) after the beginning of the meal compared to humanised Nor- malinsulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before the beginning of the meal (Figure 1C).</seg>
