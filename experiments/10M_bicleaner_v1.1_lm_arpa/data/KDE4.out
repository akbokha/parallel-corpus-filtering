package &amp; package ; includes various modules for &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; . despite their low size they offer some additional features and simpli@@ fy the use of some features of &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; by using these easier features .
for more information on the use of &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; .
to download these modules in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; select Settings Exten@@ sions .... Open the map tools and select there the required modules .
this is a list of standard installation modules from the package k@@ de ; Ad@@ d@@ ons . please note that you may have more modules installed on your system if you have additional software installed .
you should install the de@@ de@@ base package that contains &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; before you comp@@ ile this package .
to use the crash module , click in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; on ex@@ tras . then you can view the page that has &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; for crash , or the list of shut@@ down , if present , delete .
the module specific filter ( also called folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under ex@@ si@@ del@@ etes . with the module you can filter &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; &apos;s current job directory on different kinds .
to view the DO@@ M tree by the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; select a new window with the DO@@ M straight page . as default , the display starts with the root notes of the document , example : docum@@ ent@@ element , all other no@@ des are lower elements of this root .
the module &amp; hand view ; for &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; provides a further view for objects with the MI@@ ME @-@ Type In@@ ode / directory with local files . it can be used as an alternative for different symbols and text views to view the content of your local file system .
the speci@@ fic@@ ity of &amp; fs@@ view ; consists in , w@@ ax@@ ed file arch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called Tree Map graph@@ ically . each object is proportional to its size . this size must own the property that sum of the size of the or@@ derly objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
at &amp; fs@@ view , the size of a file or folder , whereby the size of a folder is specified at the size of the file . in this way , large files can be easily detected , even though they can be easily detected at the folder hier@@ archy , so I can look at a graphical and interactive version of &amp; UNIX and command .
in &amp; fs@@ view ; is an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap representation a rectangle , which represents a file or folder in your file system . to sim@@ pler navigation possess the rec@@ tan@@ gles of practical colour and labelling settings .
the color of a rectangle , which is switched on display colour mode , may either be a depth for easy detection of the dis@@ appearance or representation of a different file , such as name , propriet@@ ors , group or MI@@ ME type .
a rectangle can be lab@@ eled with the different characteristics of the corresponding file or folder . for each feature you can define whether enough space is to be displayed , or whether the surface of sub@@ ordin@@ ated rec@@ tan@@ gles is to be used , whereby the relative position can be determined by limitations during the sign of Tre@@ em@@ ap ) . in addition , you can define the relative position of the label in rectangle .
during the installation algorith@@ ms for Tre@@ em@@ aps should normally be kept that the surface is proportional to the size of the entry . at the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; fs@@ view , this target will not always be available . note that less space for the frame is lost , if the rectangle is square .
as the allocation of an entry was made for the sub@@ ordin@@ ate entries , the implementation will be delivered . here , it is necessary for label and to avoid lack of space due to boxes that are possible to be square . the best methods in this respect are lines , columns or rec@@ ur@@ sive second partition .
you can set the minimum submitted area for an entry over the menu entry view . instead , a rob@@ ber pattern on the area of the above ground is drawn , in order to indicate that this area should actually be achieved by an or@@ derly entry .
originally &amp; fs@@ view ; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map Wid@@ gets that was developed for the application of K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind .

an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera body will provide you to connect to your digital camera and supports your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ ous ; -@@ albums can be downloaded . of course , each medium and every card reader is supported by your operating system , with &amp; digi@@ ous works .
modern digital cameras draw up by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IEEE @-@ 1394 or i @-@ Link ) for data transfer . for the actual transfer to the computer , the camera is often realised as a record device . the camera can also use via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; digi@@ ous , the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 is used to communicate with digital cameras that supports a constantly increasing number of over 800 cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol , a widespread account that has been developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images of digital cameras to host computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need for additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . since photos in general large files are and transfers via the serial port is , this connection is now ob@@ sol@@ ete . &amp; digi@@ ous cameras are supported ; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of pictures with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ photoelectric 2 needs to be created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support , so the EX@@ IF support is not needed by some lib@@ g@@ photoelectric 2 camera devices . if the EX@@ IF support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photoelectric 2 , you can possibly be able to see , or the production could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things at &amp; digi@@ ous , is how easy to extend its functionality by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE image plug interface Project ( manual ) is a approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ al ; the goal is to provide the modules of all graphic programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in almost any way , as it is also a user . your advantage is that it &apos;s much easier to complement &amp; fix@@ ings ; by writing a small module to complement one function as the changes in &amp; digi@@ ous to perform .
to simpli@@ fy the windows , you can either remove the side bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F in full screen mode .
to drag and expos@@ ing pictures works everywhere : you can lay a picture in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ bau@@ ms , above the horizontal partition line or in another field window . the only restriction is that a picture is not available in words , dat@@ or list or search .
- one file selection allows you to figure out the common areas : JPEG , PNG , TIFF , Ro@@ h , movies and audio
the text filter is used only for the fields that are currently displayed in symbols . the fil@@ tering can also appear on the file name only if this man &apos;s symbols will also appear . which fields are displayed in the dialog of the dialog settings .
the view &amp; quot ; my Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; puts a organized view onto your photo albums . these albums may be saved in a single album . these albums may be saved in a single album , according to the name of their collection in the Al@@ ben@@ z or after the date printed on which the album can be modified . the date can be altered in the properties of the album .

the buttons , average , latest : these place the date of the oldest , the latest image or the average of the album . if this is missing , the average of the pictures from its EX@@ IF information is missing , instead , the date of last change of each file is used in this folder .
if you first got an album in &amp; digi@@ ous , the first picture is selected as a symbol of &amp; quot ; my Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; chosen . this will help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you want to choose another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as Album icon , select the image with the right mouse button &amp; quot ; select the picture with the right mouse button &amp; quot ; . additionally , you can draw the photo on the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
an album can always be included in a collection and collections cannot be missing .
&amp; digi@@ ous , the input of the words for individual photos in the area My Key@@ word list below in the main window . album collections have another effect . the collection includes all the photos of the album . you can naturally use both methods to organize your photos .

Moreover , you can create Search of the Type &amp; quot ; AND N@@ ICH@@ T@@ quot ; .
&amp; fix@@ tures was characterized by a long figure with a special technology , the hair algorithm . these allows images to compare these be@@ ats . the lower difference between two pictures and the more are applied . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is a range in which you can drop to any picture . if you push a picture of somewhere on the icon of un@@ fit search in the left side bar , then you will open up and you can let it fall there .
sketch : open hand @-@ hand color scheme : draw a fast sk@@ irt and fix@@ ings ; finds the matching pictures . here , a sw@@ elling value can be set .
this rider is an intuitive map search tool available based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ tool . move C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to move up a square . push all the images within this coordinates will be filtered and displayed . this is the images of course that your pictures will contain G@@ eo @-@ data .
in the field below you can specify a name for your G@@ eo filter . this will then be added for a later use of the list below . it works like a live ge@@ o@@ folder .
&amp; digi@@ ous , there is a lamp in a separate window available with which you can compare easily . it works with all supported image file formats , also raw files .
choose one or more images from any view inside the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L Add to the lamp menu . the selection will be added to the illuminated table . if you are back in &amp; digi@@ ous window , main window can be opened quickly with L Extras .
from the preview bar you can select the images you want to compare , in the left or right area of the window . if you select a preview of select from the tool@@ bar and perform there or shoot @-@ operations on one of the pictures , then these can compare it with the other picture . so you can compare the same area of the two pictures .
another mode is better suited to view quickly from a photo series . if you are using p@@ ushing out of the tool@@ bar , then the two first pictures will be displayed automatically in the areas of loading . you now use the left mouse button on an arbitr@@ ary picture to view it in the right area . this simpli@@ fies it through a number of similar pictures .
of course , the normal soldering actions are also directly from the light @-@ table such as F4 file editing ....
all image information from the right side bar of the main square are available for both slide images in the light table . this makes it e.g. simple visual differences with exposure data .
at the lower end of each area you will find a built @-@ in swivel function which you can ignore to the visible arrows . in order to swivel the visible area of the image , you have to click and hold down the &amp; L@@ MB ; then both pictures will show the same image area .
the zo@@ oming works as in other views . simply use the zoom knob among the images or C@@ tr@@ l ; m@@ ugs to zoom in the picture and out . this happens in both pictures if you are in mode preview .
what is a digital inventory - ab@@ out@@ dated from the fashion word ? digital current management considers any part of the process after the image has been taken up to the final output and the permanent storage . each of the photos takes place , sc@@ anned or digital photos provides a form of digital inventory by most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient manner .
we give you a tool , you can find a plan and practical tips as you can use your pictures , we can download and modify them on the procedures for digital photography the &amp; digi@@ ous properties . we are looking for downloading , backup , ass@@ ert , ass@@ ert , archi@@ ving , archive , waiting and export image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital Stock Management takes up , inde@@ xed , categorized , Sec@@ tors , Con@@ stant and exported content that are a mon@@ et@@ ric or cultural value . quot ;
met@@ ad@@ ata are defined as data data . met@@ ad@@ ata are provided according to your defin@@ ing data which provide information about or on a documentation of other data provided by applying a application or environment .
I d@@ ont to claim that if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , you do not need to find a specific photo . if you don &apos;t know how many photos you do not just know how many photos you do not guarantee very fast search and secure archi@@ ving that you can access to other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you need to do and know before you want to create any system structure in contrast to the data structure . you need to decide whether other access to your photos would like to save whether you want to save to a reserved drive or on a network work , etc . please make sure you need to switch to a larger drive .
perhaps you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be found quickly across your storage location . if you are getting enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folder as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; then you can use a folder for pictures you can print or publish on a website .
professional photograph@@ ers have other requirements like ver@@ sion@@ ing of photos , archi@@ ving , work processes , constant supply of pictures to different themes and a large number of all . within 10 years 95 % of archives and 5 % working files will be created and you will not want to organize your structure for this content .
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the stack @-@ processing simple . separate new from old files .
the split of original and work@@ files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . they always know if you are looking for an original or a derived image .
we also recommend the met@@ ad@@ ata option to store met@@ ad@@ ata in &amp; digi@@ al ; this ensures that ex@@ i@@ f@@ - and IP@@ TC data will be written into the file . if you forget , then you can store the met@@ ad@@ ata from the database to files by clicking the corresponding item in the menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what change ? it creates &amp; digi@@ ous , a met@@ ad@@ ata editor available for a number of selected attri@@ bute . these are of course the most important .
now , the real work , as you need to select every photo words , labelling and an assessment . of course , you can select all the pictures , which will need the same attri@@ bute and then put the value . this makes sense , as you can concentrate on the best photos in the further work .
let us now call us with Key@@ words , keywords , how to proceed with other programs frequently , or categories . all three are syn@@ onym@@ s for the same thing .
if you import the catalog@@ s pictures from another source with built @-@ in key@@ words , then the tree to insert and insert the images to the right spot . the sor@@ rows of the hier@@ archy is no problem and can easily be done by pulling a sub@@ tree to another . the changed words will be updated by &amp; fix@@ ings ; updated throughout the trees .
the graph shows how different met@@ ad@@ ata . this is a very large representation , since each block of met@@ ad@@ ata consists of many sections . date names and calendar data features of all pictures .
enough of the words - the next section refers to labelling or comments , the third important tool to detect your met@@ ad@@ ata .
they don &apos;t want to see most of your photos simply , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photograph@@ ers and agencies . they are sure to get how your photos arrive .
look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a nice beach panorama . if you consider it closer , then start to see some details , people , the place .
and now I tell you this of the landing area of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y . Wow ! one starts to dream , associations , the historical period is again present , you might even hear the silence . the label therefore has changed your perception of this panorama .
for others who consider your photos look more important than the picture itself to create an interest . if you show images you should tell a story . remember , the key is it the meaning of the viewer to help Him that you move it and understand what you understand .
it is fine if a picture is not perfect when it has the strength only with a label for itself alone .
with &amp; digi@@ ous , you can save as much text in an inter@@ national@@ ised Alp@@ habet ( UTF @-@ 8 ) , when you export your images in Web @-@ galleries , then these labels will be exported according to your wishes and / or the title of the Web @-@ Gal@@ ery system . you need to tell the story so for the opening act no second time .
do you remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find out another city without navigation system ? was it not a bor@@ ing Planet before Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures de@@ parts the train of the spatial presentation now already with light speed .
you can use the possibilities for the ge@@ ol@@ oc@@ alization . I &apos;m sure that one day , in the near future , you can easily repeat your journeys by images using images . &amp; digi@@ ous , you can also export the pictures at the Recording . you can also export the pictures also to Gall@@ ery@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc ; with Google Map view .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and describes the practice of use copyright to remove restrictions regarding the distribution and changing of copies . the same fre@@ ed@@ oms also apply in all versions , also for works of others .
the following description tells you what information in set @-@ up page of &amp; fix@@ ings should be determined as information :
author ( syn@@ onym for writer and author ) : this field should add your name , or the name of the photograph@@ ers , for example to protect the name of the photographer , then the name of a company or organization is not changed . after this value , it should not be changed once again . this field does not support Com@@ mas and Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ ons as a separ@@ ator .
aut@@ ort@@ itel ( Syn@@ onym for Writ@@ ers ) : linked to the author . examples of this field contains the title number of photograph@@ ers . examples of this field can be title like : employee photographer , professional photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a mer@@ k to the car field , this also must be completed .
editor ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the possibility of creating the photo . if the photographer works for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press , this organisations cannot be listed here if the picture shows a storage photo , then the group / agency will be presented here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although they have no protection against abuse . everyone who has no protection against abuse . this problem is able to delete or change the solution for this problem . for individuals , this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and half @-@ professionals this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is uni@@ qu@@ ely unique . &amp; digi@@ ous , in the near future , it will provide such a module for the pile @-@ processing .
topics : turn@@ key , turn@@ outs , power cl@@ amps , EC@@ C , transmission errors , age@@ ing of storage media , recovery , redund@@ ancy , des@@ per@@ ation , life time , temperature , data size , widespread super@@ st@@ itions
of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs on the road or a fire . this species of losses are the same which can also pass to you with traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section it is about problems with the so @-@ called new media .
K@@ roll On@@ track , the largest data recovery company in the world , has some interesting statistics that has a data loss .
in order to combat the problem of CDs / DVDs that need to be trusted and you may not get more than a few years . of course you can buy them CDs and DVDs to archive and more expensive . there are offers of gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece which is a lifetime of 100 years for itself . whether you believe it is in your discre@@ tion room .
CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable , but you can use this risk in which you use good discs and good capture , but they are not much more expensive than the cheapest way , but you are writing much reliable . it &apos;s worth the right to select .
CDs and DVDs are very vulner@@ able for errors , even if you are just written only . therefore we use a control mechanism to protect themselves . 75 % of the data are needed for form@@ att@@ ing and control sum@@ s . despite this massive protection , they are using chemical age@@ ing , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ;
for def@@ ective CDs and DVDs , there is a reasonable program called I@@ so@@ B@@ uster . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; however , it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; but there are also similar applications that corrupt data from damaged disks , disks , Flash media , USB drives etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to capture the format war against the HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB , and thus nearly six times the capacity of a dual @-@ player DVD with 8.5 GB . everything was said to have CDs and DVDs .
burn up slowly with a good capture device to high quality media in a not propri@@ etary format . read the media with a description , date &amp; author character and thereafter to make sure the data on the next generation of media before using the last piece of hardware or software that can read this media .
disk manufacturers reserve your statistics for themselves . their manufacturers guarantee include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides on this topic a large field study on the fault mechanism of hard drives available : flo@@ ppy disks
in brief : dis@@ ks hold the longest if you are run in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C . some of SM@@ ART clin@@ cher can &apos;t notice this error . some of SM@@ ART specified errors will termin@@ ate the immediately im@@ pending attack . these are especially les@@ ef@@ eh@@ ler and publishing counter . the expected lifetime period is between 4 and 5 years .
this is only the complete losses due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also backed up data loss due to any power if you have backed the files , but these losses can normally be recovered without major problems .
while most electrical devices are not much , this may cause serious damage . on your machine , these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause severe damage . on your computer , these anom@@ ali@@ es may cause hard@@ war@@ fare , destroyed mother@@ boards and other defects . protect themselves before the inev@@ itable loss for a loss of time and money .
the most widespread protection against current peaks is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that part of the energy reserves is absorbed and the rest . it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ bar . remember that any socket strip also contains an over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should make sure that it satis@@ fies the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this ensures a particular minimum of protection . you should also make sure that it protects your protection against lightning and thereby protects the properly connected devices .
since an over@@ voltage can use each cable to your computer , you should also proof that all the periph@@ er@@ als which can be connected to your system . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage applications that also include a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connectivity options for the co@@ axial cable of cable modems and the TV map .
if you have a not@@ ebook , then you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specifically designed for not@@ eb@@ ooks , therefore very small and you are also included to protect your modem . so you &apos;re ideal for travelling .
while an over@@ voltage protection your system protects your system from smaller sw@@ ings in the power lines it will not really help you . even a few seconds can lead to the loss of indisp@@ ens@@ able data . it can therefore be meaning@@ ful to invest in a un@@ interrup@@ tible power .
in addition to protection against over@@ voltages , these devices can automatically be able to store and drive the system . if you purchase a US@@ V , you should make sure that they meet the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the life time of battery and the supplied software is interesting .
consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and and compare the safety of current problems with the costs to avoid this . a high quality over@@ load protection can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 40 . this is only a small price difference if you think about your computer . finally , you should always remember all the cables before you go to the holiday .
the Amazon Web service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple memory service . with the right configuration you can use it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; for Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as the backup destination for your software . Google Sh@@ ared Storage is another popular offer that you can store any quantity of data .
however , they are very expensive compared to the hard drives at home very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 500 . furthermore , you must send the data about the compar@@ atively slow internet .
the solutions are therefore suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important pictures . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . it is too slow .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo @-@ community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com will provide online storage services that are available on photos . the professional option will not provide you more in full resolution , in case of fli@@ ck@@ r more . for $ 25 a year you get unlimited storage that should be checked first in reality .
from the point of view of data backup , the Web solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically adjusted by the TCP protocol and with the large companies it is included in the supply of backup and a simplified memory .
the diagram illustr@@ ate the elements of the transmission chain in the machine . all transfers are required for transmission errors . the fil@@ esystem and b@@ tr@@ fs make at least the data integrity between the operating system and hard disk .
the worst thing is that nobody says when a transfer error occurred , not if this happened in your hardware . it is fairly dis@@ qui@@ eter that it should not happen in your computer . no one seems to have thought about it . no one seems to have thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safe data route than that of your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are a further source of transmission losses , as they generate inter@@ ferences in data streams . in normal file systems this error is un@@ noticed .
even if you are currently not especially affected by transfers problems you should look to the future . in 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year .
Z@@ FS from Sun Mic@@ ros@@ ystems seems to be one of two candidates and can be up@@ scale from two candidates . it is open source , with many patents and is available under one for the GPL in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it is also available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available . read this article in English .
Oracle has launched an own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs system . this is still in alpha status . it uses the same protective mechanisms of the tender and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not part of the kernel .
not under@@ estimate that these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss in not@@ ebook and 46 % among work@@ stations . at not@@ eb@@ ooks , the share of theft is 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less widespread than most . it leads to lower damage , such as theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; there has been no more sigh@@ ted .
open source file systems are less sus@@ cep@@ tible for data loss as propri@@ etary systems : wrong , N@@ TF@@ S is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reis@@ er@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to call the common file systems . a very good English articles can be found here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : false , only the speed of the investigation @-@ process during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . if a file is not completely saved before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : false , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are removed from fundamental physical limits 1 @-@ 2 aperture settings of fundamental physical limits . this is a natural limit for these progress . sensitivity and sound characteristic for all types of light sensors are not far removed from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 meg@@ apix@@ els sensors . even though this resolution have already been deterior@@ ated for compact cameras and a high @-@ quality optics are the optimum for compact cameras . even DSLR cameras have a 10 @-@ 12 megapixel resolution . for higher resolutions , you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
a 750@@ GB hard disk drive you today for 100 &amp; euro ; so you do not have any other data loss for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are often affected by any data loss . do not secure your data after a plan and test this backup before you make something like the re@@ installation of your operating system , the exchange of plates or the size change of hard drives .
assum@@ ing your back@@ ups daily on an external SATA drive . if , then one day &apos;s flash , you &apos;re lucky if the drive wasn &apos;t connected at the moment .
a Des@@ aster proposes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget airplane accidents : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough . they normally affect a whole room or the entire house .
therefore disin@@ teg@@ ration always means a non @-@ local storage . bring your back@@ ups up to the neighboring house , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of the physical separation : as above already said is a more common reason for data loss despite securing the pan@@ ic . if you have a backup , which is not immediately available , then you can save one day .
full backup : a complete backup of all files will be secured . this is a snap@@ shot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential securing : backup of the files have been changed since the last complete recovery . generate a complete moment of snap@@ shot at two time points : the full backup and the last differential pressure .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of files that have been changed since the last backup . generate several snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status to any time . this backup comes up to a ver@@ sion@@ ing system next with the exception that it is only ab@@ get@@ ed and not continuous .
r@@ sync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily install on your machines . in contrast to script controlled FTP meetings or other types of file trans@@ missions scripts , only the difference of files that have been changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase safety over ss@@ h .
secure important images directly after you have saved on your computer to a DVD or another optical medium .
this approach will provide you enough time to recover losses and again . at the same time you will have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly battle for at least one month and a moment of torque should be done manually after which you have made a complete review .
topics : met@@ ad@@ ata , stored in the image file stored IP@@ TC information , original X@@ MP files , original retain , storage , scal@@ ability , media , recovered of images and met@@ ad@@ ata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , ... , use of the internet .
with this valuable pictures can survive the next 40 years , that is about the period in which you are really interested in you because they are aware of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies to be considered :
since the future is un@@ predic@@ table , you have to consider and rate all this today . unfortunately , there is no other way to be exercised contrary to time . unfortunately , there is no other way to en@@ act as a certain wax . if less variants you have used in the past , it is easier to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered using explanations in this document . use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtualization is now available for everyone . if you have an old system that is important for reading your pictures , then store it and install it in a virtual machine for a later use .
on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you can change your computer architecture , your storage and back@@ ing technology , or your file format should check your library and if necessary to a newer default . stay at open standards .
scal@@ ability is the specialist pressure for the possibility to change a system in its size . this means always increasing .
let &apos;s go out of which you have the scal@@ ability with the scal@@ ability and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated record or partition . at * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this section on a new record :
check the d@@ mes@@ g command whether your new record was recognized by the system , but do not hang it up .
&amp; dev / SD@@ B &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / SD@@ B , the new plate is / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; Size of the plate at MB@@ gt ; # works with ext@@ 2,3 , FAT@@ 16 , 32 and Reis@@ er@@ FS &amp; dollar ; resi@@ ze@@ 2@@ fs / dev / r@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of rice FS if necessary
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day is no software that can read it , then you can create it itself . this task is easier by year to year .
GIF is a propri@@ etary , patented format that dis@@ appears slowly from the market . you should therefore not use it anymore .
PNG has been developed as an open source standard designed to replace GIF . it can save much more . it is los@@ s@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metals , 16 bits per color channel and full transparency . PNG is required relative to many administration information , but not as many as TIFF needs and a slow compression . this format , we recommend you to store your pictures .
TIFF was widely used as image format . TIFF can store images in high quality , but requires very large files . with some cameras you can save your images in this format . however , a problem is that this format has been adapted to many people . however , there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The Digital Neg@@ ative file format is a licensed and open raw format that has been developed by Adobe Systems . it is based on the TIFF / EP format and is oblig@@ ated to use met@@ ad@@ ata . a hand@@ ful camera manufacturers are now available and we hope to use the competitors from Canon and Nikon .
this is possibly one of the reasons why to replace Adobe its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ ad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . the file information are stored using the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ g ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
many photograph@@ ers pull it before a original of your intake , most often store in the tube format . however , it can come to problems with lin@@ king between the met@@ ad@@ at@@ end@@ at@@ ei and the image file , and how above it will notice the raw format . therefore , you should use whether you use D@@ NG as a container and put everything there together .
the Dublin Core Met@@ ad@@ ata Initiative is an open organization that support for fully compatible online metal communities , discussions and collab@@ orative work in the D@@ C@@ MI communities and the D@@ C@@ MI work groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and clari@@ fied efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of met@@ ad@@ at@@ enst@@ and@@ ards and practices .
impor@@ ting images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as images are on the camera , you can use this as temporary f@@ use .
convert tube files to D@@ NG and save those in your shell archive . this function is not implemented yet .
for a fine @-@ layer processing , you can use external programs . if you edit the pictures back with &amp; fix@@ ings ; then you should add the met@@ ad@@ ata again . these were cut under circumstances from the other programs .
protect the mach@@ ined pictures for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export it only then in Web@@ gal@@ eries , en@@ code in MPEG , use contact page , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ ous , you can add a description as you can already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface makes you many advanced settings for impor@@ ting images to your album database .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ ous camera ; connect these with the calcul@@ ator , turn the camera on display mode and switch to the screen . another description can be found in the hand@@ book of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , this is attemp@@ ting to connect to your camera . if the connection is made , a fer@@ tig -@@ indicator at the bottom end and the preview can be displayed on the camera . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for file access to any file , photos , movies , music etc . on the camera .
before you download the photos on your computer , you may need to see the camera information about any entry . with the connected features and met@@ ad@@ ata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of one single or his met@@ ad@@ ata .
this dialog displays file properties and photo information to be saved internally by the camera . a symbol shows that the image has not yet been downloaded from your computer . note that some digital cameras does not have any information available .
the rider Met@@ ad@@ ata shows the internal met@@ ad@@ ata such as EX@@ IF , manufacturer remarks , GPS etc . this information are the same as at the met@@ ad@@ ata side bar from the main window of &amp; fix@@ ings ; or the image processing . note that this met@@ ad@@ ata does not have some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on their computer is the click on the button and then download the selection of all . this invites all photos from their camera to a single album and we recommend you to check whether the pictures have been downloaded in an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you don &apos;t want to download all photos , you can select the required video options from &amp; k@@ de . once you have selected the photos , use the button to download and then selected below . the button is selected as long as you have chosen some photos .
if your camera supports this , an option is now available . these pictures were not yet selected yet . in this case , the new pictures are marked with a star in the front window . if you choose this option , only the new pictures are downloaded .
if you are using the buttons , download or selected the buttons , a dialog appears where you can select the album . the list of existing albums is sorted , displayed as normal folder . details on folder you can select in section My albums . then select the album out of the list and press OK .
after you have selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ ous ; invites the photos from the camera to the album .
as soon as you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete all of them from the camera . if you want to delete all of delete all . if you want to delete all , then you must select this first and delete them out .
please note that there are no possibility to restore photos from the camera . you should not be deleted automatically if the photos are successful in a &amp; digi@@ ous ; -@@ album were downloaded , before you want to delete them from the camera . if you want to extingu@@ ish the camera control , you should make this much faster than that .
cameras use as fil@@ en@@ ame for the photos frequently . the file names are usually exp@@ elled , after taking photos from the camera to the same album . this may be meaning@@ ful , the date and time when the image has been taken into the fil@@ en@@ ame .
in the next section you will find options for turning and mirrors of the image and for data @-@ based flush . if you use this latter option , will automatically be created a folder per day .
the options During the transfer opens three more options to be carried out before the photos are stored on the record . if you select this , the corresponding entries are copied from the EX@@ IF information into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded pictures .
for example , if you wish to use another file format as the default format , you can use the pre@@ fix photo - % Y@@ - % % d : % S : % S . turn off the option to read the date &amp; time . for more custom@@ ization you should read the help of the command .
if you use the camera file names , you have the possibility to change the file names in lower@@ case . or in upper@@ case , if you prefer it .
the new fil@@ en@@ ame , the &amp; digi@@ ous ; for a photo is displayed below the name , the camera is displayed in preview . your settings for ren@@ ame are saved and automatically used when you open the camera window .
&amp; digi@@ ous , you can use all the information on the orientation of the camera to perform a automatic rotation during the shut@@ down . not all the cameras are ready . in the section side bar Met@@ ad@@ ata you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo .
the automatic rotation is normally switched on , and if your camera does not supplies this information , the photo is in original orientation . if you want to switch off the automatic rotation , use the button extension and select the Automatic rotation in the lower part of the window .
if your camera has been recorded information on which the photo was taken , you can use &amp; digi@@ al . these differences are based on the same album . not all the cameras are available in the same album . not all cameras make this information available . in the section side bar Meta Data , you can read which information about your camera may be embedded in the photos .
this option is normally off off , and in this case it saves &amp; digi@@ ous ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this option , use the button extension and select there the option file @-@ based stra@@ ins at the bottom end of the window .
the easiest way to download photos from their calcul@@ ator on your camera is a button to download . choose the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; you can select files that can be up@@ loaded up . you can also choose more than a file with the Standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image is done , asks &amp; digi@@ al ; you , where the pictures will be up@@ loaded up . select the desired folder and press OK to start the upload . the pictures will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Positi@@ oning System ) is used as a general concept in this document and is indicated on a map that can be displayed on a map . the determination of the data can be performed from the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European Galileo or any other system .
not only for professional photo biograph@@ ers , it is interesting to link an image with a precise geographical site . not everyone uses an aircraft to en@@ vis@@ ing an area through automatic recording of GPS data . environmental plan@@ er , military , police , architecture offices and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you forgot to have later , where exactly the photo was done , you can send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ ous ; users want to be loc@@ alize the place of the photos , or simply show this aspect , it is good the position data of a photos .
the question is how to get the GPS data into the image ? first you should know that ex@@ i@@ v2 supports many GPS data fields , such as direction , arti@@ it@@ ra@@ iler and card conferences ? there are at least three ways to reach this . directly with the right hardware , via a re@@ working of the GPS data and image files using the K@@ IP@@ I module for the geographical mapping ( manual ) and last about the manual input of known places .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has a GPS unit . but there are a few that works with GPS receivers . either as map module or through transmission of the data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye iP@@ A@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ dak D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR Ric@@ oh Pro G3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from one device can be done using g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ sb@@ abel . you must save these data in the GP@@ X format , since it is the only format supported by the module for ge@@ ographic assignment .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract data from pictures and of the GPS and cor@@ related . on the following page you can make the same under &amp; Linux ; do : ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and lat@@ itud@@ inal or other data , then you can use this script using the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Harv@@ ey . it uses the number of coordinates to be created , e.g. by m@@ ap@@ s.@@ google .
m@@ ap@@ s.@@ google@@ .com shows no europ@@ ean street cards . here are some European pages , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ ous , try to give you much control over its work processes how to give . there are many settings that you have to change the behaviour of &amp; fix@@ ings . to set up to these settings . the setup dialog box is divided into eight sides . you can change between these steps by clicking on the symbols of the left .

this page contains , as shown below , the standard did@@ act and copyright data . these data are written automatically in the appropriate IP@@ TC data fields , if the option is written for downloading from the camera plate . also , these data are written into the IP@@ TC fields .
aut@@ ort@@ itel is a syn@@ onym for authors name : this field should be the job name of the photograph@@ ers . this field should be known as photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a detailed description of the author , this also has to be filled .
the editor is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to specify the picture . this must not be the author if it &apos;s for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press ; if the image is a stock photo , then the group or agency will be shown here .
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the appropriate IP@@ TC rim . this ensures that the met@@ ad@@ ata are permanently displayed in the picture and are not only available in the database of &amp; fix@@ ings ; this met@@ ad@@ ata are also available and can be imported in &amp; fix@@ ings ; imported without losing .
image lab@@ eling as integrated label ( J@@ F@@ IF ) in JPEG pictures : this synchron@@ izes the comments that you can read into your photos with which images are contained in images . attention : with images that have already been lab@@ eled up , they will be over@@ written by &amp; fix@@ ings .
the page settings contains all options for information that appear when the mouse rests on the main window over a file . depending on the selected option , this information is displayed or not .

default settings can be reset you again by pressing the button on the right from each category .
the settings of the illumin@@ ating &amp; fix@@ ings can be set on this page . however some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . however , option &amp; quot ; In all image size lad@@ en@@ quot ; if you have one , then you can obtain better character results .
by default , image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer another color , you can select this here . you can use the tool bar when using the image processing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and exposed areas of a picture can be marked with dark or bright colour in the picture . these colors are set here . in the image processing , this critic can be switched on with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
the Chro@@ ma Sub@@ sampling is meant that images can be coded into a higher resolution of light density as in the color information . please read this article in Wikipedia on the closer explanation .
with set @-@ up compression , you can reduce the size of PNG files . this operation does not require image quality since PNG requires a loss free algorithm . if you have a quick machine , you can put this value to a high compression . this means 1 : a low and 9 high compression .
with the option TIFF files you can comp@@ ress the de@@ fl@@ ate compression algorithm to TIFF images . this reduces the size of the TIFF images . it has no effect on the image quality since the de@@ fl@@ ate algorithm is loss @-@ free .
with the setting of los@@ s@@ less JPEG 2000 files you can save loss free . even if you have the los@@ s@@ less setting , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than the normal JPEG . when this paragraph was written , met@@ ad@@ ata was not yet supported , but was in planning .
in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ ous , the image processing is only a picture viewer for photos . currently , it develops very quickly to a tool to man@@ ipulation of your photos . with this dialogue , you can change the settings of image processing .
the standard l@@ ame is that all green pixels are equal to ultra @-@ violet light than the pixels of ultra @-@ violet light . if you use this option , solve this option with a minimum loss of details . this option shows a little soft , elim@@ in@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 screen pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white image of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used .
this setting is used only if the white drain is not set . default , it is a fixed colour balance which was photograph@@ ed on a white card which was photograph@@ ed in the sunlight .
this setting is supported only for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SLR cameras . the use of the second sensors has the effect that exposed photos in four steps more details in the advanced sources . for other cameras , this option will ignore this option .
the default is the top , so the parts of your images are to start to consider as continuous white in the settings . setting colors will trigger some of f@@ ancy results since they display the peak in various ros@@ es . however , you can try to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from other industries .
this is possible to satisfy as green and red . &amp; fix@@ tures are not so fast as green and red . &amp; fix@@ tures are therefore trying to re@@ construct the lacking green and red percentage from the not saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a question how much color or white you want .
if you select the option , you get the option to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and can therefore be adjusted individually for each image .
set the lumin@@ ance according to your taste . you probably need to set it somewhat higher than the standard 1 . however , this can also be done later in the image options of &amp; fix@@ ings . to keep the time needed for the Dem@@ os@@ a@@ ist , you should keep con@@ serv@@ atively .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ oh@@ m algorithm is a digital image process that comes from the color @-@ filtered image sensor that have many cameras and the one matrix color pixel are available . this algorithm is also known as CFA @-@ inter@@ pol@@ ation or colour construction .
&amp; digi@@ ous ; and D@@ cra@@ w will provide you three alternatives : Bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( Variable number of gradient ) was the first algorithm used by me . Bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting when you are looking for a fast solution with an acceptable result .
if you know the color sof@@ tening of your lenses you can set the rot@@ ational and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for a color correction , since it is carried out during the shell conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions like those again should be given . there are also LC@@ MS and &amp; digi@@ ous ; information like the color information from a color space in the other to translate the colors as accurately as possible .
behavior A@@ sk@@ ed Questions when a picture is opened in the image processing / color scheme module with raw files .
colour profile folder , put here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you read all your profile . &amp; digi@@ ous , this folder considers during the start .
settings of ICC profiles have shown here the option &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles . everything can be changed when opening the shell file later .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or arg@@ y@@ ll . here are only your pictures color@@ fully not the entire screen .
the input profiles should be able to fit the camera manufacturer and model which you are using . there are some , such as Canon , which do not contain d@@ t@@ onal mapping or gam@@ ma@@ sts . currently corrected d@@ cra@@ ck Gamma is not for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you must perform the color mapping itself .
there are further options like the Soft Pro@@ of @-@ Profile , with which you can em@@ ulate a picture from a device . this is very useful before you can print a smaller color area than your camera and some colors are therefore very satisfied , instead of converting to the blind algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras it is quite evident that the colour profile for them is intended for them . unfortunately , not with the models of Canon . unfortunately , here is a table of cameras and profiles fit together . this answer is naturally un@@ official :
the Canon profile extension can recognize the style for the purpose : F for precise style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait , P for portrait and S for standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; image plug@@ in interface . it is an interface supported by a series of &amp; k@@ de ; image po@@ ets and image processing ; many modules support , which have been written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules installed , you will see a list of available modules . if you want to use , and these modules will then be loaded from &amp; fix@@ ings ; the modules will appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and above . some of these modules will also be seen in the context menu of the pre@@ set .
short @-@ commands for tasks that are carried out by modules can be fixed in the menu under settings .
more information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained via the K@@ IP@@ I project under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ k@@ ip@@ i @-@ plug@@ g@@ .org or in the manual of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the Di@@ ash@@ au should be easy to understand . the upper controller adjust@@ s the time between the image inputs , normally they are 4 @-@ 5 seconds well . the other check boxes switches the met@@ ad@@ ata or from which at the bottom end of the pictures are embedded during the ad .
the camera characteristics are shown on the left side a list of all supported cameras . on the right side there is a button Automatic detection that is enabled to identify that the camera is properly connected , switched on and in the image mode . at present there are serial , USB@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage .
at the bottom end , you can set the path for USB@@ - and Fire@@ Wi@@ re@@ - ( IEEE @-@ 1394 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active if you have a USB or Fire@@ Wire @-@ mass storage box from the camera . you have to specify the path , / m@@ nt / Camera or / m@@ nt / block , indicate your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ ous camera , you need to connect the camera to your computer to put them in the display mode .
check out whether &amp; digi@@ ous came ; the camera automatically det@@ ects . if not , you can set camera @-@ od@@ ell and port . after you set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera .
you can choose any name for your camera . this will be shown in the menu cameras of the main window . if you own more than one camera , you can add all here .
with the option confirmation of options for shi@@ fting &gt; images in the tr@@ ash@@ can , you can set the discussions of &amp; fix@@ ings ; when del@@ eting a photos in an album . in the sections of a photos and del@@ etion of a album you will find further details .
the editorial changes due to the right side bar can remain silent through &amp; fix@@ ings ; applied if you use the option changes to the right side bar without in@@ quire . otherwise , you must save the changes with the button .
you can also download the display of the welcome screen of &amp; fix@@ ings ; starting starting . this will accelerate the starting procedure from &amp; fix@@ ings .
the setting lim@@ m start to new photos search for new photos contact &amp; digi@@ ous albums / photos . this extends the starting time of &amp; fix@@ ings ; if something was deleted from the base file , asks &amp; fix@@ ings ; you can delete it from the database .
various shades schem@@ as can be used in &amp; fix@@ ings ; used to adjust the main window to your taste . these settings can be selected using settings Design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of available designs will be shown below :
these designs are defined in simple text files . if you are interested in a new design for &amp; digi@@ ous , you will find further information about this tutorial .
&amp; fix@@ ion comes ; contains a fast picture processing with some basic tools . you can use them to view your photos and to the correction and improvement . the image processing can be launched by a click with the left mouse button on the preview of a preview or selection of the updated ads / editing .
the Image Processing contains a number of tools to improve your pictures . some of them are available as modules in &amp; fix@@ ings ; so you are not part of your distribution . for more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules can be found in section Image Processing .
a status line at the bottom edge of the window , the file name , current data transfer , magni@@ fication factor and current image size .
a menu bar at the top edge and including the tool bar for quick access to the most frequently used functions .
the editing functions of image processing change your photos . however , no functions will change the original photo , before you can save the original photo . note that you cannot recover the original photo , as soon as you have saved the picture .
so you should add a copy of your image before you change it . you can save it using file stores .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by creating or re@@ produce the image processing of the image processing in the tool bar . you lose any change that you have done in the photo since the last store .
almost any action of the image processing can be rev@@ oked or recovered . the last promotion can be re@@ produced or recovered by using editing , restore change from the menu .
if you are often using this , you should take the short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ z to the back and repeat C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Um@@ sch@@ alt @-@ Z to restore .
if you select the &amp; L@@ MB ; on the back @-@ of or re@@ build button in the tool bar , you will get a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all the actions are made between also rolling or recovered .
as soon as you have started the image processing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same key@@ word by using the navigation software on the tool@@ bar , image , image down or the entries in the menu file . if you have made changes in the current photo , you will be asked if you want to back up .
you can start in the photo and zo@@ oming in that you use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse or the symbols in the tool bar or the entries in the tool@@ bar menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool bar : select the magni@@ fication factor automatically
view Full Screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode . if you want to use the Es@@ c button . normally you can &apos;t change this tool@@ bar code . if you don &apos;t want to call this in the sub@@ ordination dialog of &amp; digi@@ ous , you can call it from &amp; fix@@ ings ; main window . see the section to set up the image processing .
if you want to print the current image , you can print the image in the menu file , and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can custom@@ ize the settings here before you print your photo .
from the main menu , you can print single pictures or whole phr@@ ases . all image look can be printed on your selection . you just have to select the pictures with the standard methods and you will need to choose the images from the menu Export Printing assist@@ ants . if you follow the assistant , you only need to make your choice .
the &amp; digi@@ ous window , main window has a side bar at the right edge , which presents important information and actions for the selected images . the same side@@ bar is available without the navigation components , also displayed in the picture processing . it will be displayed if one of the five riders is clicked on :
multiple Click on the same rider lets the side@@ bar appear , or disappear again in the rim .
in order to enter with unlimited size or add the text below . the text is UTF @-@ 8 compatible . that means that all special characters are allowed . the label will be copied to the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC@@ - fields so that you can use other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are truncated and special characters are formed after 2000 characters . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling in other applications , you should note these restrictions .
after you have commented it either the button on the user or change to the next image , the label will then be saved .
in addition to the user button , there is one button More . with this you can read more met@@ ad@@ ata from the selected file or database . however , this will always be carried out if you have chosen a met@@ ad@@ ata setting that will always be written into the pictures .
the Section review will show an evaluation scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sor@@ ts . it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar , or with the key short@@ cut . in order to evaluate several pictures at the same time , select these from and use the context menu .
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field ur@@ gency . the coding is followed by the scheme in the following table :
the key@@ word view shows a search box for the words of the words , the words and a selection box with the previously mentioned in this &amp; digi@@ ous box .
the key@@ word tree is adapted dynam@@ ically to the entered search word . you can easily restri@@ ct the number of possibilities in search of a key@@ word quickly . this ability is particularly useful if you have many words .
the input field at the bottom end is another relief at the input of Key@@ words at a picture series . if you have entered various words , these are saved for quick access .
words can also be set by mark@@ er the appropriate check boxes in the tree . all tags of a image are stored in the IP@@ TC field Key@@ word .
if you select several pictures in the main screen and select a key@@ word in the key@@ word tree , this will only be applied to the printed image and not on the entire selection , if you want a selection with a key@@ word , please read the key@@ word filter section .
the default line filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side bar will be used with their album , - data , key@@ word and search terms . if additionally one or more sample filters are used from the right side , only the cutting quantity of these two are available . all in the words are available .
you can also draw tags and leave . suppose you select several pictures in the main view . if the key@@ word already exists , you can simply drag it from the right side bar and place on the selection . as a dialog box , you asks whether you want to put the key@@ word .
in the upper example , the main window depic@@ ts the pictures on one calendar day . the key@@ word filter is selected on one of the words . they were selected with C@@ tr@@ l + a , and afterwards a key@@ word from the right @-@ tree @-@ tree were drawn and put there . a dialog asks whether this key@@ word should be set .
this search for changes will be held at any start of the program . it can also be switched on under settings .
if you rule with and created a rule with and determine that it would have one or should have to change this easily with a double click on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry after which is sought in the database . this may be an album , name , key@@ word , image , key@@ word , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or a string , which is already set up in the database .
for example , you can define a Extended search over all the elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group@@ ing options only , you only need the check box at the end of the rule and then use the button . see the options as follows :
why were Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Fli@@ ck@@ r not listed ? the free disk space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save images in full resolution .
this article / tutorial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I used it mainly to &amp; digi@@ ous implementation .
the reason why one needs a colour@@ ful deviation from the colors of your camera or scanners , you can achieve a predic@@ table deviation from the actually photograph@@ ed or fed colors . with a colour@@ less workflow , you can reach the colors on your monitor from your camera or the scanner , or publish the colors that you print out of your digital dar@@ k@@ room .
if the topic comes on color management , then everyone wants to press how to press the buttons . unfortunately , the meaning of this tutorial is necessary to provide you sufficient back@@ information about color management . additionally , you should make links with deeper information to make your own inform@@ ing decisions to make you desired results .
if your image work@@ flows have met all the criteria listed below , then you must not worry about d@@ iting administration .
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated on the s@@ RGB color space ( for more information please see below )
your only different educational expend@@ itures are by e @-@ mail or web , where the RGB of the de @-@ fac@@ to standard is standard .
so if the RGB works so well and the life for all so easy , why should one use another color space and do not need to make thoughts about p@@ aging ?
a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB compared to the colors that we really see is shown below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see the hu@@ s@@ esho@@ e region , and the colors in the RGB color space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger colors , please visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms side and click on info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I need to kiss my monitor ? if I decided to work only in the RGB color space ?
yes ! whether you work in the s@@ RGB color space or not , you have to make your monitor the circle . if you work in the color space of the RGB values , then you need to use your monitor using the RGB standard of the RGB standard , using an appropriate monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions to improve the image in most cases . use it before you try to try a further manual processing .
the functions norm@@ alize , the same , automatic and contrast of the menu corrected automatic correction automatically try to make your colors the best . they will experiment with these effects to see which works best with your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aled the lamp@@ holder values about the entire picture , so the dark point is black and the brigh@@ test point so bright as possible without changing its color bugs . this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or balanced .
down the same method : this method adjust@@ s the lumin@@ ance factor of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity of a image , sometimes produces even rub@@ b@@ ish . it is a very powerful operation that causes either miracles on a picture or destroyed it .
automatic : this method maxim@@ izes the color range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and bright borders and adjust the red , green and blue channels on the entire history of the history .
contrast : this method enh@@ ances the contrast and the lumin@@ osity of the RGB values of a image by which move the lowest and highest values on the greatest possible range and a new ji@@ ust@@ ation of all values . this is only visible with balanced images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white correction of &amp; fix@@ ings came ; is a semi Automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photos .
the white correction of white correction is slightly restricted to a colour space with 8 @-@ bit per color . if you can do so far from the original screen , you can perform the white immediately in the shell mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , so your ways to get better .
this tool is based on a white equivalent algorithm of the copyright by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . it uses the menu entry color paste in the image processing .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left @-@ hand side , both the original picture and the preview of the target image is adapted . if you like to see the original wh@@ ip , it is enough to look back to the original window .
the preview of the target photos has a red mark@@ er . the lumin@@ ance of the Pix@@ els below this mark@@ er is displayed as vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
to the right above , an hist@@ ogram is shown that once you have a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , most pixel are very small L@@ umin@@ ance values . with one button you can choose whether one of the three colors or your sum will be shown . the sum will be called L@@ umin@@ ance .
the contrast of your result is depends on shadow , saturation and gamma . the shadow is adjustable to improve your photos or down the shadow details of your photos .
an@@ stat with the above controls allows you to use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press on this button and then click on the picture preview for calcul@@ ating the color temperature of white flip . on this type , the temperature and green values are automatically set automatically .
in addition , you can reset the white immediately with the list of default settings . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposed Indi@@ cator increases the colors , if more than a color channel of the Pix@@ els is over@@ exposed . this will be shown in the preview as a pure indicator , and has no effect on the final image .
the buttons are saving and loading exactly this . any setting of the white image which you have set you can save to a text file and then load back later .
the default settings sets all filter values again on their standard values and the corresponding neutral white balance . note that even neutral settings can be added as your original . if you store this original picture .
you can adjust the coefficients per color channel of the image here . 8 @-@ bit coding is better for high quality images . this encoding takes more plate space , calcul@@ us and stands only for formats PNG , P@@ N@@ M , TIFF and D@@ NG .
this tool opens the same dialog as for the editing of raw . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . colour ton@@ gs can be carried out through the base window for the usage of colour pro@@ filed . a detailed instructions for using colour pro@@ filing allows you to rate the color administration .
another important tool is available in the menu under color correction . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust to multiple color channels at the same time , allowing you to make these for multiple photos . this is helpful if your camera or your scanner always require the same mist@@ akes . in the manual of the audio correction you will find further information .
a very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the degree of gravity that you will find under color gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; tool Far@@ be@@ ff@@ ective provides you four color effects , a solar effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a Neon Effect and an edge filter available .
in times of the chemical processing , Solar@@ isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , was a effect of the image complete , and afterwards the development of the image completed . this was the effect that the brigh@@ ter areas dar@@ ker and the colors were inver@@ ted with the second illumination . the result was a partial negative of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect .
the intensity controls the solar ization . at approx . 50 % intensity shows the image what is chem@@ ically possible . an additional increase is finally generates a negative image that is not so on photo paper .
this is an example of the solar power plant . the original image is the ( 1 ) and this is processed ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vid filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it diff@@ ers from a saturation that makes it more powerful contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and smooth . try it easy to emb@@ ell@@ ished many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for a native color film which is produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . this name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and therefore a reference to his smooth image structure . Vel@@ vi@@ as strongly saturated fatty acids , but also some photograph@@ ers , especially those who are hardly a landscapes .
the neo @-@ filter simul@@ ates Ne@@ on@@ light on the contrast @-@ edge . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and sli@@ der repet@@ itions the strength of the ne@@ on@@ light . with large images , the filter can over@@ load the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to capture the different color limit of your photos using the tools in the menu . once you are happy with the result you can use the button O@@ k and you will be used .
if you want to get a photo of poor lighting conditions , you can get a good choice if you want to increase s@@ saturation instead of saturation . all changes you can perform in preview . if you like the outcome , you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool Gra@@ dation and the simple cand@@ l@@ ite intensity / contrast / Gamma is the tool of sound correction for improving the exposure . also , if the dialog for this tool is very complicated , you need only the area of sli@@ der . specifically the three sli@@ der below the hist@@ ogram .
the window contains a graph@@ s of the intensity , an hist@@ ogram , active can@@ als or the selected area . under the Graph@@ ene , three sli@@ ders can be clicked on the corners that are moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn to learn it is the knob and change it on how the image changes .
on the right @-@ hand side the original and preview of the picture can be viewed . the preview is dynam@@ ically modified , based on the settings of the image , the following options are available on the left .
sc@@ aling : with this selection box can be set if the hist@@ ogram with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic y @-@ axis is commonly dominated . with images the large areas of a constant color , the linear hist@@ ogram of a single pillar is dominated . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic influence is useful .
three knob : the top for dark tones , the medium for bright tones and the lower frequencies , commonly called Gam@@ ma@@ sts .
the three color paintings can be used in the preview of the original bil@@ lets in order to automatically adjust the input values of the sh@@ adows , medium and bright tones . furthermore , there is a button for a fully automatic alignment .
output values : the output values allow manual values for each area . there are also two knob that can be used to evaluate the output values as with the input values . for example , compression of the output values can be used e.g. as a background , while anything else can be seen in the fore@@ ground .
automatically : this button will automatically set the image values automatically depending on the intensity of the image .
save and loading : with these buttons , the set @-@ up values can be saved in the fil@@ esystem and later re@@ loaded . in addition , the Gim@@ p @-@ format is used .
if you use this mode and the three color pet@@ tes , the input values will automatically be adjusted for all sh@@ adows , medium and solar sound . activate the color p@@ ette which you want to use and click on the preview of the original image for red , green , blue and the lumin@@ ance channels .
the option over@@ exposed Indi@@ cator controls all colour channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined earnings of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it &apos;s no effect to see the final result .
below is an example for the alignment of input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and alpha Channel , and the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the correct picture ( 2 ) .
on the left hand , half of the original and the target picture is displayed . the preview is dynam@@ ically updated depending on your settings . the following options are available on the right side :
modifications channel : this selection box enables the channel to be specified by the module :
in addition to this box there are two symbols to switch between a linear and log@@ arith@@ mic view . for images that have been recorded using a digital camera , the linear mode has been generating a wide beam . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic mode helps in this case .
for example , if you move a short rope to the right , e.g. the bright tones , you can see that these bright tones are correspon@@ ded with dark extracts and the corresponding image pixels dar@@ ker .
on the preview of the original photos , a red mark is visible . if you want to change this marking on the curve , the right line is displayed on the curve that is the original value . create a point on this line and move it off and down until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save and loading : with these buttons , you can do exactly this . each curve you can hereby generate this file system and then be loaded . the file format for this is Gim@@ p short @-@ format .
if you use this method and the three color pet@@ als automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of the shadow , medium and solar sound . activate the color p@@ ette which you want to use and click on the original image for the rot@@ ational , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the option over@@ exposed Indi@@ cator controls all colour channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it &apos;s no effect to see the final result .
below you can see a black @-@ and @-@ white photo that has been corrected in the lumin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun sound was used with the color p@@ ette and applied to the curves ( 1 ) and the correct ( 2 ) .
the channel mixer of &amp; fix@@ ion came ; image processing is a tool to improve the colour duc@@ ts or change the color cas@@ ings of the photos .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the color shades of the images . you can process it from the menu Color mixer for image processing .
with the channel selection box you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first hint as you can correct the relative distribution and impact . the left range of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed by comparison to your own rider .
the preview of the target image has a red mark@@ er . if you place them in the image , a vertical line appears in the hist@@ ogram to display the respective color value .
the controls for the module are right below : regulator for red , green and construction allow you to activate these channels . if you also activate the color settings , this is especially convenient , when the channel mixer is then able to reduce the usage of great black @-@ and @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix Mon@@ och@@ rome , the reduction of a color is one of the visible noise that looks in the same place in colour channel and their cra@@ wler looks different at each channel . if the case is , you can improve your mon@@ och@@ rome conversion in which you need to reduce the colour@@ less first .
saving and loading buttons are used precisely for this purpose . any mixer setting can be saved , and then load . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer .
the option over@@ exposed Indi@@ cator controls all colour channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined earnings of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it &apos;s no effect to see the final result .
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been adjusted . the option L@@ umin@@ ance is activated . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the illustrated picture below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography was always fascinating because of your abstra@@ cts . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a step , as color images can be easily converted to the computer . also with a set of movie roll profiles .

green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good , with all scenarios and fits particularly good to portraits of the sky . like the 004 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) green filter .
orange filters : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a orange liner filter . this improves landscapes , marine scenes and air photos . similar to the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) orange filter .
rotary filters : simul@@ ates a black / white film ir@@ radiation with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ eration effects and can simul@@ ate lun@@ ar contents to day time . similar to the 003 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) rot@@ ters .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) yellow filter .
Sep@@ i@@ aton : produces warm bright and medium tones for a bit col@@ dness in the s@@ att@@ eln . this is very similar to the process of fl@@ atter@@ ing of a printing and re@@ development in a Sep@@ i@@ at@@ onic . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and thus similar to the 005 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the &amp; digi@@ ous , tool texture can apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture .
by adding a texture to your picture , regardless of it a colour picture is or not , you can look like an oil painting on a canvas , the Sti@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a wall painting on a wall . the menu entry image texture can be used for this .
relief : move this parameter to the right increases the depth of the depth or three dimensional stability of the texture on the picture .
a paper text effect has been used on the photo below . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the changing below ( 2 ) . the relief model was set to 200 .
added the &amp; digi@@ ous ; tool frame can add a decorative frame to be added a picture .
to keep the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photos , there is no easy task . a possibility to set his attention is to put the painting a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the scattered eye . under the frame , the module can be started from the image processing .
type : using this parameter , set the desired frame type for your image . through the picture with a colored line , ni@@ ep@@ ce ren@@ ders it with a thin three @-@ dimensional frame which is ideal for a button@@ hole and decor@@ atively add a decorative frame with patterns .
the width of the frame is in percent . the value range for width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
this goal is to be larger than the original , but the same aspect ratio is bigger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you have using the tool after aspect ratio .
with this practical tool , you can insert easily a format@@ ted text in a painting at any point . this also goes to several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . enter text surface , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with his features such as you need . depending on the picture , the larger must be the character set . finally , choose a frame around the text and / or a clear background . already the picture is finished .
any setting you have chosen for your text , you can change to the button &quot; OK . &quot; after the image has been saved once , the text is part of the image . it cannot be changed .
click with the &amp; fix@@ ings ; Tools template can create a template on a picture .
the menu template onto the image processing can be used to lay templates on a picture .
for the templates there are no restrictions on the size and orientation . you need to add the PNG file format and want to add with maximum compression ( 9 ) to add to the file size of the template ; simply send an e @-@ mail in English to &amp; fix@@ ings ; ma@@ iling list of digi@@ ous user @ k@@ de.@@ org ..
if you use this tool to the first time you need to put your templates with the button base file in the dialog . select here the folder you want to copy the template files . these settings will be noted for the next start .
after the root folder set for templates , a building view , which reflects the folder &apos;s structure of a sten@@ cil . selecting a folder will update the preview bar of the templates .
under the preview you are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and modify the position of your image .
Enlarge : this knob increases the shown picture . it is cent@@ ered for the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
shr@@ ink : this knob shr@@ inks the lower picture . if you want to use the position of the mouse . if you want to use the template on the whole image , you have to cut the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move it : simply use this button to move under the template . take the image and place it at the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template onto your image . the image will then be adjusted automatic of the preview size .
&amp; digi@@ ous , there are three different tools for shar@@ pen@@ ing . each of them has advantages in other areas .
shar@@ pen is a traditional tool for shar@@ pen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but produced in dark areas , gra@@ ins pictures .
sp@@ icy mask works on the contrast of the edges to look like a picture . actually , it works more psych@@ ovis@@ ual . you can use it to remove atmospheric Dun@@ es and makes it a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is protected by copyright from Win@@ ston Chang .
it is possibly the best of the three , since it really improves the shar@@ p@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters to adapt .
photos without Focus as well as most digit@@ alised pictures require a correction of shar@@ p@@ ness . elements that are smaller than the resolution should be put together to a common color . the same phenomenon can be observed when colour points can be printed on paper . SLR cameras usually require more succ@@ essi@@ vely shar@@ pen@@ ing than normal cameras for private use .
in JPEG pictures , one camera has been used to use internal shar@@ p@@ ness . images in the shell format is always necessary to be shar@@ pen@@ ed during processing .
some scanner apply a shar@@ p@@ ness filter already during the reading of the image . if you dis@@ able this image , you get control of your image .
in some situations you can get usable results by shar@@ pen@@ ing a photo with the shar@@ pen@@ ing value . this can be viewed with the menu entry correct shar@@ pen@@ ing .
they ought therefore to be careful , since the results will not work much of course : the shar@@ p@@ ness increases the shar@@ p@@ ness of the edges , but also ampli@@ fies the noise . in general , it is achiev@@ able via the menu entry . on request , you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for shar@@ pen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cris@@ p . the solution to draw a little soft than it is much easier than it . use the tool for sof@@ ter with the menu entry correct and experim@@ enting with settings . the preview window displays the effect on the right @-@ hand side of the dialog displays the effect on your photo .
the filter un@@ ur@@ red is a very good tool to remove the veil of your photos . a demonstration can see here .
the original image and preview help the image to edit . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often produce good results and should be tried first . increasing the radius or consideration . if you generate the im@@ shar@@ p@@ est mask , become noise and the impression of gr@@ ates in the vicinity of sharp edges .
the radius constitutes a like many pixels on each side of an edge through the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow bigger radi@@ i . you should therefore shar@@ pen images in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the wi@@ per picture is added to the original . this makes the strength of the shar@@ p@@ ness .
the sw@@ elling is a fra@@ ction from the maximum RGB value and the difference of difference . you can define a minimal difference to define an edge of filters . in this way areas , areas with a soft switch between the tones of shar@@ pen@@ ing , Himm@@ ler and water surface avoided .
this is an example of the un@@ bl@@ ur@@ ate filter . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and the mach@@ ined image ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp m@@ asked with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a sw@@ elling = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; tool @-@ focused on a picture by improving the shar@@ p@@ ness . it used the copyright protected by Ernst Li@@ ppe protected by copyright .
this tool tries an image to &amp; quot ; re@@ focused problem than just to try the photo . it is used to use a technique called F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese . it is used to start better results as an un@@ bl@@ ur@@ ge mask . it can usually run even better results as un@@ bl@@ ur@@ red . you can start it by using colors by pressing colors .
in practice , the circular folding works much better than the Gau@@ ge &apos;s folding . the Gau@@ ge &apos;s folding has a very long tail , depends far from the original pixel size , the F@@ IR Vienna In@@ verse of the Gau@@ ge &apos; folding is affected by most cases even very strongly influenced by the distant pixels . that causes un@@ desirable results .
circular shar@@ p@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular folding . it is the most important parameter for use of this module . for most pictures , the default value should set 1 good results . you can set a higher value if your image is very un@@ sharp , but then should be on can@@ y@@ um@@ shield .
correlation : to increase the correlation can help Ar@@ te@@ fak@@ te . correlation can be used by 0 @-@ 1 . default values are 0.5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0,@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the visual effect of the module .
pir@@ ate filter : an increase in the space filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . however , values are higher than 0.1 only rarely . if the noise filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 is the image quality very bad . a usable value is 0,@@ 03 . a high value will still be higher .
G@@ auss &apos;s shar@@ p@@ ness : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ge &apos;s shar@@ p@@ ness . in most cases , you should use this value to 0 to avoid anno@@ ying Ar@@ te@@ facts , so you may also increase the correlation and / or the noise filter .
matter size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . if you select large values for the circular shar@@ p@@ ness or the Gau@@ ge &apos;s shar@@ p@@ ness . note that module is very slow if you choose large values for these parameters . in most cases you should select a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
saving and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any sequence of parameters will be set to you later and can then be loaded .
try out all trimm@@ ing , colour and intensity correc@@ tions on the picture before using the module .
otherwise you should use the module before you change the image elsewhere . the reason for this is that much operations changes the not immediately visible , but later left un@@ pleasant arti@@ facts .
if you read images and comp@@ ress , &amp; eg ; than JPEG , you should use the module on un@@ compressed image .
generally produces un@@ bl@@ ur@@ ate better results than shar@@ pen@@ ing . this could be caused by using un@@ sharp m@@ asked to use a larger neighborhood than shar@@ pen@@ ing .
theore@@ tically it has to generate un@@ bl@@ ur@@ ate arti@@ stically . for the Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter it can never be removed . for the Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter it is always at least the result of the F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter , always at least as well as the sp@@ icy mask . the F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter is often better when machining small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters , on a small un@@ focused image :
the original un@@ sharp color image has to be corrected . this image has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to in@@ sufficient light for the auto focus lens .
for more information about the method@@ ology of shar@@ p@@ ness , you can read a technical comparison in English under this address .
the knob we@@ aves the in@@ shar@@ p@@ ness of the division which has been dar@@ kened to create a natural pup@@ il .
the tin@@ tin@@ ge allows an adapted colour for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes rather than dark dark , then you can set this here .
the image error correction is one of the most developed tool in order to remove the desired arti@@ fact with an unprecedented speed .
the algorithm has been developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE Team of the GR@@ EC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains various settings as strong points to simpli@@ fy the restoration . the available pres@@ ets are shown below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings , you can use the riders and advanced settings .
detailed detection p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the maintenance of details . a smaller value leads to a smooth glass of smooth and pressing details . a value of 0.9 should thus obtain that no shar@@ pen@@ ing is needed . please note that details are always under the direction depen@@ dency .
direction depen@@ dency alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value is smooth in all directions , while a value is close to 1 only in one direction . JPEG Ar@@ te@@ fak@@ te are removed best with a value close to 1 .
smoo@@ thing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoo@@ thing about all . p then defines the relative smoo@@ thing . therefore , set this value matching the degree of noise in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter specifies greater structures . the higher this value is needed , the more is needed , since it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , it must be higher than 3 .
repet@@ itions : indicates how often the algorithm is running . normally , 1 or 2 is sufficient .
angular progress da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic Alpha . if Alpha is also selected , you should also choose small angle . make sure that small angle should generate a long runtime . you should therefore select this value so maximum and acceptable for your needs .
integral step width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral step width in pixels . you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoo@@ thing and never exceeds 2 .
linear Inter@@ pol@@ ation use : the more quality you receive by selecting this option is only low . it doubles the runtime . we therefore recommend it to allow him to allow .
the buttons are saving and loading exactly this . any setting of image error can now be saved in a text file and later to be loaded .
image error correction is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can still last very long and take a high CPU load . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button demol@@ ition .
below you can see how to be corrected like image error with Small Ar@@ te@@ fak@@ t . the module will be used on a photo that created in Guatemala City with a analog camera , that caused by a bad film storage during the trip , the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the correct picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ ous , rob@@ otic reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce frame rate . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides selectable image filters for example to remove st@@ ains and other arti@@ facts , e.g. from dust or hair on the lens , too . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ discovered ; effects of saved images from books or magazines .
if you require further information about sensor levels of digital cameras , you can read this tutorial in English in this tutorial .
the screenshot picture above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ ined noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the sub@@ window settings can stay with default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . great values improve the time the filter per pixel are needed and can be p@@ iti@@ zed by the radius indicated above the image and the colour in him is sm@@ ooth@@ ed and the smaller error is adjusted .
shar@@ p@@ ness : controls the shar@@ p@@ ness distance . this value sets the pixel distance between the filter to the front . if it is increased , rob@@ bers are extingu@@ ished . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter image data may not receive more and rob@@ ber@@ ing or dirt occurs again .
edges : controls the edge accuracy for the shar@@ p@@ ness . if it is too strong , the frequency response of the filter can occur . if it can be too strong , or smo@@ kes can occur . set it on a value near the maximum if you want to remove a weak room or JPEG arti@@ fact without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance of the image . we recommend to change either color or lumin@@ ance to improve your image . these settings do not influence the smoo@@ ther process by details settings .
colour : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend to change either color or lumin@@ ance to improve your image . these settings do not influence the smoo@@ ther process by details settings .
gamma : controls the gam@@ mat@@ ol@@ er@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dar@@ ker areas which typically are stronger , but cont@@ am@@ inated the shadow ranges .
damp@@ ing : controls the adjustment of ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter@@ damp@@ ing . this value is defined like fast the adap@@ tive filter radius on variations of lumin@@ ance . if it is increased , the edges may occur . if it &apos;s on a minimum , rob@@ ber@@ ing and Ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter may occur in the edges . he can remove rob@@ bers and is the recommended method for it .
save under and loading : these buttons are used precisely . all parameters for the rough@@ ing , which you have set , can be saved in the file system and then loaded .
this is an example of how to change the noise of your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was applied to the default settings .
sometimes a picture is cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . the solution to draw a little sof@@ ter than a picture is lu@@ ck@@ ily to correct turn@@ tables with the menu entry correct and experim@@ enting with the gl@@ itter@@ ing window . the preview window displays the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ ous came ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photo acts .
this filter for rest@@ or@@ ations gives you the possibility to remove a lot of un@@ wanted ar@@ ising from your images . it is very well adapted to remove delic@@ acy , cr@@ ater , compression acts and local errors found in digital , original or subsequently digit@@ alised images . the gl@@ ands occurs along the image con@@ tours and thus gets the content as it is also the human eye .
the same algorithm can be used for colour and tex@@ turing . the algorithm is developed using another tool , the image error correction was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE Team of the GR@@ EC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ ar and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG Ar@@ te@@ fak@@ te reduce : compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas it produces some compression &amp; quot ; Ar@@ te@@ fak@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards can be seen in un@@ compressed image . this setting is supposed to correct this problem .
the buttons are saving and loading exactly this . any setting of photo rest@@ ration can hereby be saved in a text file and later to be loaded .
photo restore is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can still last very long and take a high CPU load . you can therefore finish the calculation at any time with the button .
below you can reduce how a photo with equal noise . the module is applied on a black and white photo that with an Min@@ ol@@ ta ( TM ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the inf@@ am@@ ous film gra@@ ins on the faces . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the corrected below ( 2 ) .
below you can see a further example of the photo rest@@ oring . this time , tex@@ tures was read on an old colour photo that caused by a scanner . you can see the scan arti@@ facts that could see from the sc@@ ann@@ er@@ lighting and the photo paper . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the correct picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; tool Hot@@ pixels allows you to remove Hot@@ pixels of photos which have been protected with a CCD camera , eight have been used algorith@@ ms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pix@@ i project that are protected by copyright by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , t@@ ote or hot pixels are particularly high quality raw mode photos , as many cameras with JPEG compression about a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixel rate ; and &quot; quot ; bright pixel rate ; at a photograph with a dark image sub@@ tract method . there is currently no manual method to select the poor pixel .
download this file in the wi@@ z@@ ard with the button dar@@ k@@ screen . the tool will recognize automatically the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the picture preview .
if you have an old digital camera , it is important that you can record the dark image directly in the port to discover new hot or bright pixels through CCD defects .
first described in the previous section , you should download the appropriate dark picture to the correct picture . an automatic processing of the dark rendering will notice the bad pixel . note that the assistant shows the last dark image and re@@ loads this automatically in the next session .
the picture range and the preview can help you correct the result within the picture . the preview window displays the output of the filter with current settings . bad pixels are highlighted in all areas of view .
select an area around the def@@ ective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ishing these pixel blocks . these are the available filters :
Dur@@ ation : an average of the neighboring pixel is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all def@@ ective pixels in block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is made separately for horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block will be moved to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the def@@ ective pixels in block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are moved to comp@@ ute a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ishing the pixels in block .
Kub@@ isch : all pixels with a gap of 3 or less will be moved to comp@@ ute a bi @-@ Cub@@ an surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which then use the def@@ ective pixels in block to inter@@ pol@@ ishing .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photograph , consisting of a def@@ ective digital camera with sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure , the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the correct picture is below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ ous came ; vig@@ net@@ ti@@ fication correction is a tool to correct the vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. exposed corners , a picture to correct .
wide angle lens , especially those in the medium and large photo format , often cannot illumin@@ ate the entire sensor range . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ ting quot ; ( sh@@ ady ) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light to the sensor . teleph@@ oto lenses show this behavior .
however , it also has dis@@ advantages . many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 at the aperture filter which should be impossible to keep the camera with hand . wide angle lens should also be able to use a opening of f / 16 or smaller because otherwise un@@ shar@@ pen effects arise by movement .
using the large exposure areas of today &apos;s fil@@ ming and color or color scanner , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a c@@ enter@@ ity that without this filter it is possible to simul@@ ate the transformation of a c@@ enter@@ ous correction , which is protected by John Walker . the algorithm is protected by John Walker .
with three points you can control the vig@@ net@@ ti@@ fication filter filter and with three further exposure of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light @-@ ampli@@ fication at the point of the largest density filter . the default density is 2.0 , or acci@@ dental laser with a aperture of 2 , de@@ j@@ up@@ set the density to compens@@ ate a larger degree of vig@@ net@@ ting , reduce it to compens@@ ate a small degree .
leu@@ k@@ ite , contrast and Gamma settings : editing a image with the vig@@ net@@ ti@@ fication correction reduces the lumin@@ osity of the pixel . you need to re@@ adjust the exposure of target image with these options . regul@@ ating the regulator , you need only positive values to increase the settings .
if you want a fine re@@ tuning of the target image , then let the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / Gamma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ ous , image processing from the menu Color Gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the vig@@ net@@ ti@@ fication correction on a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vig@@ net@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) shows the correct picture . a leu@@ k@@ ampli@@ fication and counter@@ point correction was also carried out in the image with this tool .
the &amp; fix@@ ings came ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the effect of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by David Hod@@ son .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric distortion . colour distortion can not be corrected using this tool .
the coefficient of the second gra@@ des treated the general geomet@@ ric distortion of the lens and can correct the con@@ cave or con@@ ve@@ x shape of the image .
the coefficient of the third gra@@ des has a similar circular effect , but fl@@ atten@@ ed off to edges . this correction is not applied in the mold .
the coefficient may be corrected the remote corners , opposite the second gra@@ des . if you combine these two , each geomet@@ ric distortion can be cut almost eliminated .
generally : this value controls the strength of the distortion of the second gra@@ des . with negative values , tons @-@ shaped distor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values c@@ is@@ ite distortion .
corner : this value controls the strength of distortion @-@ fourth degree . this value does stronger elsewhere in the middle of the image . for most lenses the &apos; corners parameter has the reverse sign of the parameter General .
zoom : this value scale the image size and performs an correction of the first gradient through . negative values can be reduced while positive the image .
light : this value adjustment the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values they increase .
to help you find the best filter settings , illustrates the dialogue with a preview correction . values that use you for your image are stored and using the next start as default values .
the tonn@@ age or k@@ is@@ sen@@ ic correction should be performed before all trimm@@ ing or size changes . best result , make this correction as all the first . if you have a picture of new and then reduce an over@@ ty @-@ shaped correction , the effect of fal@@ seh@@ ood .
to help you help the best correction you can display this tool a vertical and a horizontal relief line . move it to an important place such as the sea level or a building wall , in your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines on this spot . in the connection , you can correct the tonn@@ age / k@@ is@@ sen@@ ic distortion using the lines .
if you correct a k@@ is@@ ite distortion is the resulting image black edges . you can remove this with the trimm@@ ing tool in the menu Trans@@ action cutting from the image processing or via the zoom regulator of this dialog .
for most images , the tonn@@ age @-@ shaped correction is sufficient . the next logical step for some moti@@ fs like pictures from the front , frames and paintings makes it the perspective so correct that if you keep the camera with your hand , you always have a slight distortion of the perspective .
this is an example of the US @-@ shaped correction on a church in Norway . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the correct picture below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to simul@@ ate infrared film of the G@@ vacc@@ Gur@@ a.@@ org website which is accessible under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( TM ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ IR film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rectangle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the image .
below the preview you can simul@@ ate two parameters for film gra@@ ins and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . the ISO regulator changes the quantity of film gra@@ ins and the domin@@ ance of color green ( chlor@@ ophyll in nature ) in converting . green meadows are white like snow !
since the filter colour duc@@ ts to re@@ produce infrared film , especially the green channel makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos since the color information are missing .
this is an example of the infr@@ a @-@ red file format used on a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the illustrated image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a type of A@@ ura in the shoul@@ ders .
the &amp; digi@@ ous plant filter is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to re@@ produce film gra@@ ins on your pictures , such as the B / W Ko@@ dak Tr@@ i @-@ X , known for the sensitivity of the films - the manufacturer great silver @-@ gra@@ ins of the photo@@ emul@@ sion .
the film gra@@ dation effect gives your photo a certain atmosphere or seems to move back into the past . the treated image gets a tim@@ eless atmosphere get rid of everyday life . if you like this special , Gallery @-@ like , road maps , especially in your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ ms photos , you need to use this filter .
with the regulator , the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated for control of intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity . the default value is , although higher values are required , however , if you need more gra@@ ins , you can use the filter several times .
this is an example of film gra@@ vit@@ ational effect on a black / white image . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and that worked ( 2 ) . the used film phot@@ os@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ ous plant ; filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting . it uses an ur@@ gent algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ ous , filter oil painting gives your digital images a nice look like an oil painting . natural pictures and styles are good for this effect .
there are two knob to influence this effect . the upper sel@@ ects the pin size between one and five . th@@ icker brush are better suited for large images . fl@@ atten the gl@@ are or from the other side , the hin@@ ess .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original picture is marked with the ( 1 ) and the image is marked with the ( 2 ) . pin size for this 640 pixel image is 1 and Gl@@ ue 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; filter charcoal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients . pictures whose gradient can change slowly . it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sk@@ ate . this would have good pictures to start .
there are two knob with a range of values ranging from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper controller cho@@ oses the pin size and the bottom adjustable the contrast ( gl@@ ar ) .
this is an example of the charcoal drawing filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be improved further through adjustment of the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; filter engraving shaped your picture in 3 @-@ D , as if it was stamped in wax . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; filter engraving is a fast tool to restore your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works very good at images with a simple structure , in which colour is not the most important in content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to turn the image into a gray , mon@@ dar@@ ing landscape .
the depth allows the contrast of the fil@@ tering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the mach@@ ined image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group , you can transform a normal photo into a art book using distortion effects . it uses protected protected algorith@@ ms by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divide the image in cells , and makes it look like if it is considered through glass blocks .
shaft Stage 2 : analog to the wave blocks 1 will be distor@@ ted with a different version of glass blocks .
some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can termin@@ ate this effects at any time with the button .
with this filter group , you can transform a normal photo into an art book using un@@ shar@@ p@@ ness effects . it uses protected protected algorith@@ ms by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Un@@ shar@@ p@@ ness : wi@@ ping the picture along st@@ oned lines that go out of a core . this simul@@ ates the im@@ shar@@ p@@ ness of a zo@@ om@@ ic camera and produces a dynamic expression of often in sports photography .
radical un@@ shar@@ p@@ ness : wi@@ ping the image through rotation of pixels around a center . this simul@@ ates the im@@ shar@@ p@@ ness of a rotating camera .
distance : wi@@ ping the picture to generate the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems back in the background .
motion @-@ shar@@ p@@ ness : ignor@@ ance the picture by horizontal movements of pixels . this simul@@ ates the im@@ shar@@ p@@ ness of a linear moving , z : B : coming from a car or train photograph@@ ing , camera .
significant im@@ shar@@ p@@ ness : wi@@ ping the picture soft into the dark and strong in bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ amour photos or to add a warm and sub@@ tle of light .
flow shar@@ p@@ ness : wi@@ ping the picture by random displacement of pixels and simul@@ ates the in@@ shar@@ p@@ ness of a arbitr@@ ary camera .
intelligent un@@ shar@@ p@@ ness : finds the p@@ add@@ ling pool in the picture and wi@@ ped out these without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : divide the photo in rectangular cells and then created it by filling with an average pixel rate , new .
some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time with the button .
the valves are a nice little tool to make ra@@ iny on your picture . this makes it natural your images a wet appearance . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n protected by copyright algorithm .
Tropical size allows to change the size of the trop@@ ics . since the size of the picture is not enabled , it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish oil changes the optical effect of drops on the picture .
you can hold with the &amp; digi@@ ous ; image processing a range from rain@@ drops . do not use the range of tools to choose the area , e.g. a vision that should stay free . if you start the filter , the area will remain free from rain@@ drops .
this is an example of the reg@@ ression filter . the original picture ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the mach@@ ined image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
when the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it through mirrors or turning into the proper orientation . the tools can be found in the menu transform@@ ations or transformers .
photo gra@@ zing is definitely one of the most developed tools in order to enlarge a photograph with a minimum loss of image quality .
to shr@@ ink a picture is simple . the big question is how to get an image of bub@@ bles and keep details sharp ? how can you be found in a picture ? how can you find the missing information or guess ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm is used here , making it a good job . try it and you &apos;ll see it itself .
when a photo of the wrong size you can change it to the desired size with the mold size . choose transform@@ ations size in the menu and specify the target values . the dialog can be seen below .
the tool used for size is using a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to increase the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool to blow up .
many image processing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ines Inter@@ pol@@ ation . using an improved approach . the under@@ lying algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE Team of the GR@@ EC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you must say the tool as you want to change the size . these settings are available in the rider New Size and are shown below :
keeping an aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled , the new size will preserve the aspect ratio of the original size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter specifies greater structures . the higher this value is needed , the more is needed , since it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , it must be higher than 3 .
the buttons Save as and loading will be used exactly . any one can enlarge as text file and later to be loaded .
photo gra@@ zing is very fast with what it makes , but it can still last very long and take a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button .
you can see below for example , when a small color image has been increased to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard magni@@ fication for comparison .
the cut of a photos is not only common operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to summar@@ ize a picture . the image processing is simply just the rectangle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and draw the rectangle , then you &apos;ll see this rectangle while you move your mouse .
when you start the mouse button again , the area of the photos will be cut out . thus you can change a good overview like your photo after cutting . you can easily create the size of the right edge by removing the edges of the rectangle . a new rectangle create it with the left mouse button .
as soon as you are satisfied with the cutting machine , use the push button of the frame processing in the tool@@ bar and the photo is tail@@ ored ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the entries file saving or file stores under the menu file to save the newly designed photo .
in the swing area , you can change the size of the rectangle by post@@ p@@ one the corners using the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog will remain .
in the set of the aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as high @-@ format or cross @-@ format . in the high format it is always assigned to the larger value of the height and in the cross@@ wise format of the width .
the tool supports an aspect ratio as an aspect ratio . this means that it is always equal to whether you use centimeters , In@@ ch or any other physical size . you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to activate the selection automatically horizontal or vertical .
below in the dialog you can use the Max . ratio button for cutting on the maximum possible , depending on the chosen relationship and orientation .
the tool after aspect ratio saves up its settings depending on image orientation ( Horizontal or vertical ) . if you are using the trimm@@ ing tool , these settings are stored as default values in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data is reflected the cut image and not the original image .
the help of the connec@@ table help allow help to bring out your pictures better . these help are :
harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic particles are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . as the third party rule , harmon@@ ic triangles are an opportunity to share a rectangle in similar harmon@@ ic triangles .
golden center : the golden center is a split up for different natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Naut@@ ilus shell or the bl@@ ossom leaves of a sun@@ flower . it dives in all possible things that we find as beautiful .
the golden split is the error number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used already in the ancient Egyptians and Greeks , which are using your temple and pyr@@ am@@ ids . artists and architects have used the golden split in all times when you build your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your cre@@ ations a natural order and beauty .
the number is taken by the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; from where each number is equal to 1 equal to the sum of their two previous numbers . the resulting divider is 1 : 1.6@@ 18 the golden center . a composition of this rule is shown as a vis@@ ually harmon@@ ious .
the golden center represents smoo@@ ther support lines such as you occupy a picture . these help are shown below :
the Golden Spir@@ al will bring you good results to generate good results for your photos . compared to the third party , the golden spiral produces a liquid line of the eye through the picture . this type of composition leads the view of the panel along the line of spiral design and creates a symmet@@ rical visual river .
a further rule are the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral . these rec@@ tan@@ gles are used to produce the golden spiral . this may be a line of the composition . this may be a line of or different objects . this may just be able to lead the eye without having the eye , it will accompl@@ ish its task .
the golden triangles is also derived from the above @-@ discussed golden spiral . note that in contrast to harmon@@ ical triangles , golden triangles is no equ@@ il@@ ateral triangles . diagonal to make these lines a static object can be seen dynamic .
if you are using golden triangles , use a effect of professional photographer dynamic Sym@@ met@@ ry . try your image focus on one of the inter@@ sections and other visual information in the triangles . the result is a very attractive composition that you can &apos;t reach differently .
the options horizont@@ ally mirror and vertical mirror can be used to mirror the harmon@@ ious particles .
with the button color you can set the color of the auxiliary lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the auxiliary lines can be invisible . on this type you can custom@@ ize the color of lines on your current image .
the Free rotation is a tool to rotate a picture around any angle .
if you make a photo , it is easy to keep the camera not vertically or horizont@@ ally . this creates an image to be rotated vertically or horizont@@ ally . you can manually repair this with the &amp; fix@@ ings ; photo processing and tool free rotation . choose transform@@ ational free rotation and adjust the target angle .
turn your picture with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this sli@@ der are displayed in degrees . with the button Pre@@ ferences , you can reset the sli@@ der again to 0 degrees . a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture will be shown on the right .
for your help the module free rotation a horizontal and a vertical line available . move the mouse poin@@ ter to the two lines . after moving it over a key point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous section .
after you shot a picture , you will find un@@ wanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a possibility to repair this is the function transform@@ ational cutting from the image processing .
an elegant way to cut the picture is automatic cutting . select one of the following options :
the option Anti @-@ ali@@ asing will un@@ lock the image a bit after the rotation . be aware , however , please note the above warning .
all per@@ spectral transformation is performed by a fixed point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is shown in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle .
in order to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then be re@@ charged automatically . on the right @-@ hand side of the dialog you will find some information which help you to change the perspective :
new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas which are produced by the transformation , in pixels .
new height : shows the height of the new image , including the empty areas which are created by the transformation , in pixels .
top left : shows the current angle in degrees on the upper left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees on the upper right edge of the transformed area .
at the bottom left : shows the current angle in degrees on the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees on the bottom right corner of the transformed area .
after adjusting the perspective , the image will be a bit dirty . for a single adjustment , this effect is small but two adaptations generate a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this .
after which you have attached the perspective , you will get in@@ tim@@ est@@ able tri@@ angular holes at the corners . a possibility to transfer this is the image with transform@@ ational cutting from the image processing .
the mould tool is used to move a portion of the image to the right and move the other part into the opposite direction . this is no rotation , the image will be distor@@ ted . with other words , a rectangle is transformed into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module via Transform@@ ers .
check your picture by using the horizontal angles and vertical angle . if you press the horizontal and vertically at the same time , the angle will be reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be shown and the new dimensions of the target image will be shown on the right side of the view .
to help you get a vertical and horizontal line . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall of a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the check tool to adjust your image .
after you have conducted the check , the picture will be wi@@ ped a bit . for a single shift , this effect is usually neg@@ le@@ cted , but two shades have twice as much knowledge and therefore should avoid this .
after crossing the image has the image of unusual tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a possibility to remove this is the image with transform@@ ational cutting from the image processing .
&amp; digi@@ ous ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write . the available formats depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way how this libraries have been comp@@ il@@ ated . in most distri@@ butions you will have a large number of image formats with &amp; fix@@ ings .
due to this dependence on other libraries , it is impossible to specify a list of all available file formats in this place . however , they are always JPEG and TIFF .
&amp; digi@@ ous ; shows only files in formats to know . this is done using file extension and a comparison of these with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is shown in the list . you can change this list of file extensions the &amp; digi@@ ous ; I can accept further information on this list .
almost all digital cameras save photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras allow you to select even the format . a detailed description of this file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ ous formats are supported ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression techniques to digital pictures . in this way , redund@@ ant information is reduced to save the image data to a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general there is better , smoo@@ ther results than JPEG when the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s can also be saved , if this is specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw material format , you can read from Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . you can convert Roh@@ lo@@ c pictures in JPEG or TIFF with the raw converter of &amp; fix@@ ings ; you can also find information about the use of modules with &amp; fix@@ ings ; .
&amp; fix@@ ion came ; supports the shop of raw pictures only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which included in &amp; digi@@ ous ; all support cameras can see below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw materials made by &amp; fix@@ ings ; supported :
many digital cameras support the recording short films . these clips are often saved in Avi@@ o or MPEG format . and digi@@ ous options are often added to display or edit . if you click on a movie file , it is not possible to display and click here . if you click on a movie file , click &amp; k@@ de ; settings on playback of movies use the program to play back .
go forward to the earlier album in the chron@@ icle . you can only go forward to go back soon .

K@@ IP@@ I module has a number of images exported to a K@@ ML structure . K@@ ML files can be opened and displayed using Google Earth Earth .
if you make the steps 4 and 5 , what you can do good if the initial contrast was very good , you can perform the first four legs with the module white .
many tools you need to get in &amp; fix@@ ings are included ; their description follows here .
all image processing tools like shar@@ pen@@ ing , sof@@ ter , rob@@ otic , reproduction , un@@ bl@@ ur@@ alistic , &amp; etc ; use a uniform dialog type that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . see &amp; quot ; texture Applic@@ able ; in this dialogue :
( 1 ) : this progress panel shows the status of the filter to the current image . on the left hand , five buttons allow the comparison mode of the proj@@ ections to change . these modes are :
vertically split without duplic@@ ates . the left part shows the original and the right shows the filter to the right of the chosen area .
horizontal parts without duplic@@ ates . the upper section shows the original and lower shows the filter applied to the area below the chosen area .
vertically split . the left range shows the original and right to compare the effect of the filter .
horizontal parts . the upper section shows the original and lower than the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ mouse over &apos; -@@ style : show preview when the mouse is not on the front and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons which you can turn on to show over@@ sight and exposure of exposure . the colors can be adapted to the general site page .
( 3 ) : a preview of preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse within the picture and want to see on the part of the picture , from which you want to see the preview . the preview of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your standard values . all setting of the module can be noticed .
the side@@ bar features shows the essential information about the selected image and is largely expressed in itself . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo Properties : shows a summary of the most important parameters in the shooting of the photos . these data are from the EX@@ IF data when these are available .
this rider is an intuitive map search tool available based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ tool . move C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to move up a square . push all the images within this coordinates will be filtered and displayed . this is the images of course that your pictures will contain G@@ eo @-@ data .
&amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; is an editor for pall@@ ets files . application can be used to work from color pall@@ ets and to choose and use colors .
the pall@@ ets files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de ; can be installed either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case they are located in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Settings and hot de@@ defined color and last used colors .
in the Dialog box you can select from a list of installed pall@@ ets or search the folders to files .
the cur@@ sor is displayed in the pallet view as a line . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
it shows the color beside it . the color is described under the pallet view . here you can also change the color name .
it can also be used to select a choice , click on the area next to a colour to move the cur@@ sor there . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button .
if the check box of the cur@@ sor is inserted under the button on the cur@@ sor is inserted either . the colour will be inserted either or translate any other ; depending on whether the mode has been chosen . this mode can be set by clicking the check box below Bei@@ m cur@@ sor .
a selection , which creates such as described in the last section , can be used along with the actions copying , cutting and insertion .
&amp; col@@ ore@@ dit ; used the following format for data in cli@@ p@@ board : for each color , three values for the shares of red , green and blue and an optional color name , followed by a tick @-@ end signs , if you are three num@@ eric values in the cli@@ p@@ board , these can be inserted as a color in &amp; col@@ ore@@ dit ; inserted .
colors in the range and the output of the colour selection can be drawn with the mouse .
a colour somewhere on the screen and then select them in the colour selection on the left .
&amp; graph@@ s ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ programs are free layout programs . graph@@ s are used in science , especially in science , especially in science . so far , there were no modern &amp; GUI ; programs to visu@@ alize graphics . the programs , the &amp; graphical ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with just a few functions .
the &amp; inspir@@ ational ; project has set itself the goal to replace this programs by a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical user interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; graph@@ s ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ Graph@@ ical ; -@@ programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graph@@ s ; displays graph@@ s with all the possibilities of a good integrated &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI . it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; Kate ; and &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of Graph@@ ene in &amp; Kate ; Graph@@ ene new and graph@@ s ; represents )
menu to open the Graph@@ ene in &amp; Kate ; open the Graph@@ ene in &amp; Kate ; open in a &amp; Kate ; -@@ Component
load large graph@@ s ( currently there are problems of about 1000 knots and a h@@ ack to present more than those no@@ des )
further required software : &amp; k@@ graph ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that uses &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for presentation of the Graph@@ ene . required in detail :
the main window displays the opened graphics , each in a own sub@@ window . at the beginning , if you start &amp; k@@ graph@@ s ; without an argument , the main window will only open the symbol file and the ( empty ) list Fin@@ ally opened files . click on the first icon to open the dialog .
after you have selected a or more &amp; dot ; -@@ files selected , the main window looks like in the lower screen photo :
as you can see , an overview on the corner is displayed if Gra@@ ph is larger than the drawing area . you can select a fixed position of this review or select this position automatically .
using the mouse ( high and below without special keys , left and right with pressed &amp; Alt ; -@@ button ) ;
the zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by a factor of 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the just changed in &amp; k@@ graph@@ s ; loaded file from another program , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the Gra@@ ph is to be re@@ loaded or if you wish to ignore the change . if you want to change your choice later , you should also change your decision later , you can use the menu settings ... use , see also .
if you can open a graphic card outside an ongoing &amp; k@@ graph ; instance , &amp; eg ; in file browser or at the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; cas@@ viewer ; instance , or want to display the graphics in a sub @-@ window of the already ongoing instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but also changing the dialog dialog .
when program launch , you can open all graphics of your last session . again , you can save your choice of both save and later .
you can also define how the Gra@@ ph is to be split up to several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely elected .
if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graphics card will be igno@@ red on this page . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out of the respective parts of the graph .
side@@ board with one of several pages divided graph@@ s without head@@ lines and with another font
the page again gives you the possibility to define the behaviour if a file has changed on the hard disk , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can define a standard behavior ( automatically re@@ load or change the program each time ) or the program every time .
the site Open can be the possibility to define the behaviour of &amp; graph@@ ically . you can define a standard behavior for this case ( the graph@@ s can open in a new window or determine that every time is required .
the site seat administration gives the possibility to define the starting behaviour of &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; define it . you can define a standard behaviour ( the files from the last session or not ) or determine where you can be asked then .
the context menu , which usually appears in a click on the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; will be opened , further possibilities :
here you can choose from different &amp; graphical ; -@@ Layout algorith@@ ms select . the entries as they are described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; are :
&amp; dot ; -@@ algorithm , the standard for directional graphics . he produces hier@@ arch@@ ical or str@@ ati@@ zed represent@@ ations of directed graph@@ s . the algorithm lay@@ eth the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom left or from left to right ) and then attempts to produce short edges and can be used as far as possible edges .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the default for un@@ equi@@ voc@@ al graphics . he produces represent@@ ations in accordance with the jump @-@ model . thereby , the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multilingual sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm creates a j@@ umping model layout for un@@ equi@@ pping Graph@@ ene . it uses the fru@@ str@@ man @-@ clean gold he@@ ur@@ alism , and includes a multi @-@ grid sol@@ ver for the treatment of large and clust@@ ered graph@@ s .
the &amp; cir@@ co ; algorithm arran@@ ges the no@@ des into a circle under the description of Six und Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and Kau@@ ff@@ man and meadow , 2002 . he is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ c structures .
open a dialog where you can specify a lay@@ outs which is then executed by a shell . the command should display graph@@ s after st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot @-@ format . with such a layout command you can give &amp; eg ; the &amp; graph@@ s ; -@@ algorith@@ ms special options , or change the graph@@ s with a filter before it is drawn .
determines the type of Graph@@ ene ( judged or un@@ prepared ) and turns the standard algorithm for the respective type ( dot ; for directional , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for un@@ constitutional graph@@ s ) .

the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization allows GPS coordinates to add and edit . the ge@@ ographic data are stored in the EX@@ IF file and the loc@@ alization can be displayed in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization makes tools available to loc@@ alize images geograph@@ ically in the spher@@ ical coordinator system that is used by GPS and Galileo . height , longitudinal and lat@@ itude are used .
in order to cor@@ relate your pictures with geographical data , you need a GPS trace as XML file in GP@@ X format . g@@ s@@ sb@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ one you can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ograph@@ ical loc@@ alization cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can lead a number of previously selected images using a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate to the main window and call the menu . in order to run a possible correlation between time and loc@@ alization , you have to download a track file containing GP@@ X file . this file contains the same time at the same time , as images of your camera .
when the file is loaded , the coordinates will be shown in red . GPS trace data are recorded in GMT times and therefore the camera @-@ time will be done with the GMT time . this can be done with the time zone . place your camera zone here .
the maximum deviation for the maximum period deviation is an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera period . the deviation is among them the data is summarized . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you do not have a track data of one place for pictures you can manually edit the GP@@ X file and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then be related to all pictures in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ishing and difference in minutes may be used if you do not have any matching data . if you know that in reality a local difference between camera and GPS lies , you can place this limits and then specify the button .
the coordinates can be manually set with this dialog . this is useful if you have a number of photos on the same place . since the dialog can use the coordinates of a call to the next article you will need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found with the displayed map and enlarge it . choose the concerned region and enlarge it . the height must always be selected manually . the card can always be manually selected . the card can always be changed between card mode , satellite image and a mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module there are possibilities to hang about the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool is used to provide a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums in a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.0@@ 1 . you can select the albums that have been exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is encoded UTF @-@ 8 to allow best possible internation@@ alization .
the module has four riders to be adapted to the settings . the rider selection allows you to select all the albums . with the three buttons on the right hand you can select a large number of albums . in the area among them , the Al@@ ben@@ ch@@ schau and the text of the screen will appear on the right side of the HTML page will appear .
the rider &apos;s appearance defines the general look and layout on each page . this rider is largely declared . if you click on a picture , a new page will be opened in the picture . otherwise , the picture will be displayed directly with your standard image , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show , displayed
the rider album defines the settings where and like the gallery should be stored with all your corresponding pictures . choose a folder that contains write permission . a sub@@ folder with the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ export , which contains everything will be created there .
if you have selected JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information is stored in the new pictures as well .
with other color depth , you can change the standard color depth . it also influences the file size . all other settings are explained even .
the riders print images allows you some of the settings of the album riders for the view , which are small images that are displayed at the gallery .
a progress window displays the user at how far the action is . press off to break the process .
if the module has been created , the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore read the programming language . the web browser will automatically start to display the preview of the Gallery . press the button to close the module .

the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a dip .
the MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video , with a defined length . this module uses the pack@@ ets of M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick . you can also add a basic image file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slides .
all pictures will be sc@@ aled automatically to the correct size for the selected video format . additionally , you can choose a background color for the dial . with this module , it is possible to create DVD / X@@ VCD / SV@@ CD / VCD for your DVD player . finally , you can use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
first you have to be packed into the images that will be packed into the MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au . then you can start the module via ex@@ tras MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au .
the images that are selected by you are listed under image files in the portfolio . you can also change the images or contents of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should select the other settings . if you are using different formats , DVD , X@@ VCD , SV@@ CD and VCD . in case you are planning to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NTSC . PAL is default and most probably the right choice for Europe .
in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds to specify a picture . the speed of the image process is specified below . a low value creates very sudden , a high contrast with very smooth image changes .
the background color can be set as next . in doubt , you should leave it black . the name and the path of the generated file can be found under the name of the MPEG @-@ output file . keep the extension mp@@ g .
if you indicate an audio file under the name of the audio source file , you can start the movie into the movie . after all your computer you can start with the button . depending on your computer &apos;s speed you can now drink it quickly or in all the rest of your computer . if you have to enjoy a coffee , if you are back again .
if a hint appears that co@@ dec or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick packages to the right below .
the printing assistant allows several pictures to print in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be opened automatically with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is useful to improve you or print using the Gim@@ p module for direct expression .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import them to convert images in one of three formats to JPEG , TIFF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w from Dave Coff@@ in . an original case from Him is : expect from d@@ cra@@ w not that it generates the same results as the software from your camera manufacturers . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w better results ! .
first choose the RAW file to convert and start the module . the R@@ aw @-@ Image Converter window appears in mode for a single image . with the button preview you can preview the effect of your current settings .
you can now adjust the values to optimize the converting process . the first option decides , if the camera settings are to be used for the White . the essential parameters such as Gamma , brightness and red / blue amplifier can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can further edit the picture later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected so you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switch does not have effect .
as soon as you are happy with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and the converting result remains the same and only the extension is adapted accordingly . JPEG uses a loss algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
tagged image format , TIFF , reserves all information of your image and uses the los@@ s@@ less L@@ Z@@ W compression .
if you are frequently asked to process your pictures or later , you should not choose to use JPEG format , as it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality deterior@@ ated . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you are using JPEG as a memory format , the met@@ ad@@ ata are stored in the JPEG file in the JPEG file in the EX@@ IF data .
if you have adapted your settings , you can start the conversion button . if you want to break this process again , then you can cancel the conversion .
the pile @-@ processing mode allows you to convert various images to one time . use this mode if you are safe , for example through testing on a single image that are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical with the version for single images . however , this is helpful if this is created in an earlier attempt . however , this is not available . the progress panel shows how far the conversion is advanced .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the convert of the image from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can use the pre@@ fix , the starting number and tim@@ est@@ amp of the timer .
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a image collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can reduce the image or enlarge the image of the image change :
proportional ( 1 ) : normal size change in a dimension . width or height of the image is automatically selected , depending on the image orientation , the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option to adjust your image to screen format .
not proportional : this option is changed in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed in this option .
print preparation : prepare the image for the photo pressure . the user can set the printing resolution and size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , bound@@ ary size and background color , is adapted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can send chosen images with your favorite E @-@ mail program . it is also possible to am@@ end the size of the given pictures before . additional pictures can be accessed from the list of the images .
after you have launched the module , the window window will be displayed by you with a file selection dialog . you can add more images using a file selection dialog . for the last displayed image , a preview can be displayed on the right side .
you can also draw pictures on the picture list and add it to the list of the selected images .
the pictures will be removed from the list of the selected images from the list of the selected images .
after you have selected all pictures you can open the new news window of your e @-@ mail clients . you have to add the addresses and the subject . you have to add the addresses and add the subject .
do not pay attention to many photos at one time . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations for the size of the immediate e @-@ mails . it is possibly a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window will be used to change the settings for the images of the images . their configuration is stored and changed every time again until you change it .
select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you need to specify the right path for your installation in the input field .
if you are using the Google Mail service , you need to install the GM@@ Thai agent on your computer . you can download this here .
after selecting comments in an attached file the comments are added to the images into a text file and added the mail .
the PNG format among the menu images format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best custom@@ ised among the los@@ s@@ no formats such as TIFF . you should therefore use PNG if you don &apos;t have a fast Internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend the JPEG format .
if you are using JPEG images , select the original files in JPEG format , then the original Ex@@ i@@ f@@ data will be added to the sensitive pictures .
when the process is ready , the window will not be closed automatically , so that you can view the status messages when searching for errors , your e @-@ mail program will start automatically at the end . with the button closing this window appears ? EN .
after starting the module Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au appears a window with questions like you want to see your Di@@ asch@@ i . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album .
the Open@@ GL transfers in the presentation use very elegant image inputs using Open@@ GL . however , you must have a corresponding graphics card as otherwise the slides will be very slowly .
the fil@@ en@@ ame option ensures that the fil@@ en@@ ame can be displayed in the left corner while the presentation .
the loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in a final loop . you can manually break it manually with Es@@ c ;
the option Images random@@ ly select that the images are displayed in a random order . so it is not used to order the order of the pictures in the album .
in case of delay between the images can be set between the individual images . 1500 millisecon@@ ds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transitional effect . you should also test this to your friends !
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose . random from any transition between the pictures a different effect .
during the Di@@ ash@@ au you can access a tool bar at the top left of the screen . move your mouse in this corner to change you .
with this tool@@ bar , you can hold the presentation and start again to jump to the previous and next picture and stop the slide show .
at the left , you can see the current file names , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date adjusted currently no documentation . if you are interested in writing , please contact the Mail@@ ing list of K@@ IP@@ I Teams under k@@ de @-@ im@@ aging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to set a picture as background image for the work surface .
this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the under@@ men@@ tions , as a background for your K@@ DE working surface .
as soon as you have added your pictures and videos with notes , you can watch with &amp; zip Album ; by these browsers , see picture . as you can see by a comparison with the picture , so in each group , so in people , places and in the group keywords are present .
in the browser window , you will see the categories you have entered as you have entered your pictures and videos with notes . additionally there are entries to view according to EX@@ IF @-@ based information , and of course view the current preview . in the following , each of them is described for itself .
if you press with the mouse on the entry , change the view of the browser . see picture .
if you select another person , only the images are displayed on which both people are visible . by this selection method you can restri@@ ct the number of images displayed by a few thousand pictures on a few thousand pictures .
if you have selected all persons , places and other settings , you can view with preview images to view the images of your action area .
in the picture each person has the same symbol in front of her name . you can save with &amp; h@@ ay album ; however , it is of course also for places , words and other categories that you have defined yourself . see the picture below .
to display photos next to the name , select the button which you want to set the right outside on the tool@@ bar . note that you can see the view for each category . this has the advantage that you can display symbols with images of people and simultaneously a list of lit@@ ters ( if you don &apos;t own any suitable pictures for your words ) .
however , you must select what image for each individual person is to be displayed . in order to do this , you must select the Image of the Image Files tab on your wishes . in the case window you can adjust the magni@@ fication factor according to your wishes and therefore select which part of the image will be shown and cut off .
when you select the entry in the main window , you will find a dialog box that is very similar to the dialog for Fest@@ ing the Image Properties . this dialog can be seen at the picture again .
if you want to enter a string of characters or descriptions the images are searched for this text . if you want , you can also enter a date after being chosen ; the date may be either a part of the total file , so for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the lower part of the window you can browse all the images on certain names as you can see in the picture . here &apos;s pictures on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene .
this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ ly album ; if you don &apos;t like to read books , but rather try to try out functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the homepage of &amp; John Album ; and look at the quick entering , the screen photos and the introductory videos .
start &amp; Play Album ; and choose the demonstration in the first dialogue , if you start &amp; add in the first dialogue , or choose the menu entry into the menu . then some example will be loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ ly album ; try out .
if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ as album ; as a program HTML document to download .
at the bottom edge of the main window of &amp; k@@ ola Album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this strip can see here : . as the name suggests , this strip shows you data statistics about the pictures in your database .
the time strip can display several different time units . each strip shows a different unit . you can change between the units , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by using only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the time line can be inter@@ viewed on the following ways : you can select the displayed entries preview of the database ( if you select a date ) and also shows the time strip the current date of the currently displayed images if you navigate in the preview view .
you can also select a range of the time strip by clicking the mouse button and select the mouse over the ruler of the time strip , so the time values , if you select a range , you will select the selection list , by clicking on a bar of the Tim@@ eline .
&amp; Tex@@ an album ; provides you two possibilities to create HTML websites with your pictures . the one is available in &amp; p@@ ly album ; integrated and the other as a module is available . in the following part of the user manual is described in &amp; a @-@ album ; integrated version describes you can create about the menu file HTML ... .
before HTML pages will need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas of content , layout and goal . in the following purposes , each range is described .
first , enter the title of the transfer@@ ring and a description that should contain the HTML file later . on a blank Album ; HTML sample Pages you can see an example for this settings .
next , choose whether a &amp; DVD album ; -@@ export file is to be created on the review page , you will find further information about export files .
last@@ ly , you can select which information is displayed on the HTML pages . for example , you can avoid that information is displayed by a party . note that all pictures have been exported without explanation . for example , all pictures have been exported . you can not use this setting to hide specific pictures before certain viewer .
in this area , you can define how the HTML pages should look like . most of the installation options are clearly written , which is not specifically received .
at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images . this allows those to view your website and supports a monitor that supports maximum resolution 800x600 , for example a resolution of 1600@@ x@@ 1200 .
at any time , the viewer can change the dis@@ solution at any time you have set the resolution at any time . it can display your pictures with low resolution , what to achieve a lower transmission time , it changes to a higher resolution .
in this setting area , place the various folder and the URL where your website is stored .
best select for all your HTML files a basic folder and for any subsequent set a new sub@@ folder .
first you need to select the main folder where all your pictures will be stored . this folder will be saved and automatically added to the next time . thus , you can select either a folder or from K@@ DE supported protocol , for example :
after you have created your pictures , you can check if you select all of the viewer . if you have created a web browser after the pages have been created , the URL you should specify here . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong file .
if the HTML files created from you are not yet in the final target folder you need to specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base file in which all sub@@ folders are located .
the just described installation options have changed all three on basic folders or UR@@ Ls . in these , a sub@@ folder is created , whose name can be found in the output folder .
if you are interested in a family party , a conference or somewhere else , with other users from &amp; to a album ; you may , of course you want to create a HTML page for viewing the images . however , you may have a lot of time to apply to the pictures , recording place , etc . , then you have to put back with &amp; h@@ ay album ; this work will not even make it once more .
with &amp; D album ; you can export a copy of your pictures to a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import other into your database and import them with ex@@ - and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ as if the pictures are stored in the file or whether the images can be saved in file . the advantage of all images in the file is that you can set aside all the images and this file is so independent . the obvious advantage is however the file size .
you can select a .@@ k@@ im file directly from the menu file expor@@ ting ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with a HTML file , this is an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file is looking for images on two way . first , the images are not found in the folder of .@@ k@@ im file . if the images of the URL , you are searched for creating the HTML files , this is naturally only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using HTML export .
the following will be described in the dialog for expor@@ ting images that you can edit over the menu file ...
the main option of this dialog box is whether it is an internal or external .@@ k@@ im -@@ files . there are three options available to you :
if you want to copy the .@@ k@@ im @-@ file , copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file copy .
with the Autom@@ atically , copy the .@@ k@@ im @-@ file , copy &amp; DVD Album ; the Images automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . since most pictures have been compressed to JPEG and the XML file itself is very small it is usually not comp@@ ress the files . if you want to comp@@ ress this , simply select the option export file .
the last option of this site is maximum image size . if you want to send your friends images , you would not want to limit the pictures , as the .@@ k@@ im file would be very big . here you can say the size that each picture should be 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file using file extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu file impor@@ ting ... select , it will be released &amp; are released to import expor@@ ting database as described in .
the Assistant for impor@@ ting consists of four steps . first , you need to select what images you want to import , in which folder you want to import pictures .
it can be that you should know the category people of the imported file ( if you &apos;re a chips ) , while this category is called for your database . therefore , you will be imported in the third dialog window , which are to be imported into your database for these categories .
in the fourth step , you can compare the categories of the file to imported file with the categories of your present database . one example is on the picture .
it must be easy to browse pictures and view : if you see images , you often want to view images within various picture groups &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; if you see pictures of your Italy vacation , you might want to see a picture with your friend you would like to see all the pictures on which this friend can see .
in this manual , you will find the various steps from ( 1 ) fixed the information about your pictures , via ( 2 ) the search and watching , up to ( 3 ) advanced issues and adap@@ t@@ ability .
K@@ Photo@@ Album was started as a program to manage your images . but it has been extended and today car@@ es your videos . at many places this manual is spoken about pictures , but often does this also include videos with one .
&amp; double album ; stores all of its information in the inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top file of their images . this is a simple XML file which you can copy to a program of your choice , e.g. Normal backup tools , copy to a disk or re@@ visions in CV@@ S , where you want to order .
&amp; k@@ he@@ w album ; re@@ members the folder where your pictures are stored and used this when you want to start a different database with pictures , you can start a different folder with pictures , you can start &amp; h@@ ay album ; with the -@@ c option -@@ c ~ / company / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
in addition to the menu entry adjustments , you can get ... get to a window , with which you can change the settings of &amp; can album ; in the following section of the user interface you will be explained the various setup possibilities .
on the left you can see six different symbols , with which you can call setting up the preview and options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available that can be accessed by a button on the F1 button and click on the desired option .
in fact , as you can define different features for each picture of different features , such as people , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums .
on view the dialog box is used to process already existing groups . for each group you can select a label and symbol .
in the section sub@@ categories were already mentioned . in the dialog , you can setup complete list groups , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a central gli@@ des as explained in .
in the right selection of setting options , which are available for fixed member groups . with the above @-@ listed selection list , you can select the category . in the left window , select a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; Tex@@ an album ; shares his modular system with other graphics applications such as digi@@ plug @-@ in and g@@ wen@@ view . this modul@@ us system is K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image plug@@ in interface . n@@ ly information refer to the homepage of Ki@@ pi .
the modules can be called on the menu modules . the modules can not be described and are distributed in this manual , as they are not sold separately from &amp; Ds , but most modules have a help page that you can call on the modules itself .
since the modules can be used together with several applications together , it can always test that the modules are always tested with the demo database before you can use them using the command &gt; k@@ ola Album -@@ Demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or via the menu help . do not say , I wouldn &apos;t have been war@@ ned !
the applications that use the modules via K@@ IP@@ I are very different , so that it can be very different , so that some modules can &apos;t work with &amp; discs ; this is the dis@@ advantage when you share functions with different applications .
the largest difference between &amp; cold Album ; and other applications that can also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications are not supported in albums ; this type of order is not supported , simul@@ ates the order for some modules , so that you can use the functions with &amp; a model album .
there are simul@@ ated &amp; h@@ itting album ; the current album , which is simply the current view@@ point , so all pictures that show you the picture look at the moment .
besides the latest album , &amp; k@@ released album ; the modules also have a list of albums . this is going to be released and will be released , as follows :
if &amp; movies are album ; s browser shows the contents of a category , for example , all persons , then each entry in this category is a album for the module .
or it will be the category that you have set in the setup dialog as a category for virtual albums , so if you &apos;re using the category people , we will do &amp; get album ; so do if you have selected to view people and to the module this .
since some modules with &amp; D album ; not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start to install the setup dialog , and select in the range of modules that modules should be loaded .
on the picture you can see an example for a start screen , once you are &amp; are released , with your own pictures .
as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , you can see the window with which you can browse through your picture database . currently , there are no information about your pictures . in the section we will display on this window , but now click on the record picture that shows you an overview with all existing pictures .
one of the main features of &amp; k@@ ates album ; is the possibility to see any picture with notes where the image has been recorded , etc . you can use each image either individually or for a larger number of images certain notes simultaneously . if for example , on all pictures of Jes@@ per is recorded and all pictures taken in Copenhagen .
all of these notes can be used for searching and browsers as you can read in the section . if you want to see this remarks if you are using the built @-@ in viewer .
in case you can see three lists with a text box by adding people , places and words . these are a very important part of &amp; cold album ; because you can always use them again when you enter information about your pictures .
the following idea is based on shi@@ fting the pictures within the list : if you are for example a family party and are shown on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 people , you can find that the names mentioned above are moved up quickly and arrange them .
if you prefer to receive a alphabetical order list , click on the icon for sor@@ ting after date under the list .
if you have chosen notes for any image , you might want to edit any selected pictures and add these pictures with remarks . click this case simply on the front and back buttons , which are located under the preview of the picture on the right .
if you have several pictures , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to select all these pictures and add the menu item multiple entries at once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all participating in the US and San Francisco and Los Angeles in California .
on the picture you can see a browser window of the USA as Over@@ all . in order to indicate that there is a over@@ load , a special symbol is displayed .
in the context menu of the not@@ ice@@ di@@ alog@@ s it is possible to add an entry to a existing or new or sub@@ category . additionally , you can also post a entry to make this entry into a category of this entry . attention , this assumes that you just sort your categories in alphabetical order .
you can post@@ p@@ one the elements of the not@@ ing di@@ alog@@ s by clicking the strip edge that form the top edge of the frames , click and move . you can also make a own window by drag it out of the window area .
if you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs to be satisfied with the settings , click on the button options ... , which offers you the option to store the current structure and appearance of the window .
you can also send a frame completely . if you want to get this window later again , use the button options ... and then window will see / out . this process can be seen in the picture .
if you select the record images in your browser , you will get an overview with preview images of the currently selected images , or all images if you don &apos;t have a filter . you can see the size of the preview , as easy after pulling down the mouse with the middle mouse button , configure it just times .
if you like a painting in the background of your desktop , this picture is set up as background image for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , this picture is displayed in the picture . if you still have a window with a picture viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete pictures in the picture preview . simply select the corresponding pictures you want to delete or choose either the removing button or select in the Edit menu . now , select the window you can see in the picture .
&amp; k@@ ates album ; you can also use a solution for this problem . you can also use the pictures anywhere you have to be saved on the hard disk . of course you have to record the pictures somewhere in the database . in the picture you can see the view of &amp; jo@@ z album ; if not all needed pictures from the hard drive can be loaded .
pictures where the right upper corner is cut off , are not shown on the hard disk . for images 5 @-@ 9 , however , the preview images are available , so this image can view this pictures . however , they can not watch this pictures with the picture viewer .
as you see this function you will need to copy files from the folders and copy them again . if you want to avoid off@@ end of the question right now . if you want to avoid off@@ end of your pictures , please purchase a larger hard disk drive to store all pictures on it .
in the menu Pictures , you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , please click to browse the images that you can see for other un@@ accessible and click to see all the images that you may see your little sister , and select the menu entry everything except for the current view .
thus you have set what images in the case of the case should be hidden . if you lock the laptop on your little sister , simply select the menu entry images , which you &apos;ll see all the images you want to go . if you want to get out the pictures , click on sperm .
it is also possible to set a password which must be entered into un@@ lock the images . in order to set this password , select password Change in the menu privacy .
please remember that this image protection is not able to read or delete all the images on the hard drive and to the other one can read out the password as an un@@ turn@@ key text or delete . this type of password protection is used only with those who are able to wake up with a DVD album ; not very familiar , the view of private images .
the reason why you want to describe all your pictures with &amp; cold Album ; manage and want to review them over hours . this is why you want to consider them at some time . this reason &amp; a DVD album ; it can be seen from the preview as described in , as described in .
the viewer can see you in . it shows the picture , but additional information you have shown on the picture , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc .
if you want to see the information box on the upper part of the image , you can also drag and put them differently . you can also configure what information is displayed and whether all of these options are available after a right click on the viewer . the context menu can be seen below .
some words in the information box are under@@ lined . if you click here the browser , see , matching entries in this page . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all pictures from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have multiple images in the viewer , you can change between them before and back , by using the buttons image high and image . you can view the first and last image with Pos@@ 1 and end . these functions can also be reached from the context menu .
if several pictures are loaded on viewer , you can run them as a dip . &amp; k@@ ola Album ; invites you to press a new picture after a few seconds . as frequently it can load a new picture by pressing the Str@@ g button and Plus or min@@ us . started and stopped the di@@ ash@@ au with the keys C@@ tr@@ l ; S .
a very useful ability to change the viewer &apos;s viewing and can be changed in full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete place on the screen . simply use the input button to change in full screen mode and back .
if you are using the viewer in the picture and zo@@ oming . you can simply add a rectangle with the mouse . using the Min@@ us button you can zoom in the middle of the image . shows how a zoom @-@ rectangle is marked and shows the result of the zo@@ oms .
with the point button you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not drawn . with the same key , the zo@@ oms , so that every pixel on the screen is equal to a pixel of the image .
note that the only zo@@ om@@ oper@@ ations that work out at videos that are in and zo@@ oming with the Plus@@ - and Min@@ us paste .
rotate the image from the context menu . this does not work with videos . you can &apos;t work with videos . you can do comments on the current image with the menu item notes from the context menu .
if you consider images , you will find a picture of a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture . at the moment you can check out the check and configuration dialog of the image to mark these names . however , they will be able to select only the image and look more pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to see the pictures on paper . to see what photos you can start the viewer with the images and select it as good or bad , while you see one after another .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the opportunity to view images with features , while you can see them . characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can use a feature that you press the appropriate letter . in the picture you can see a picture where the characteristics A , B and C are set .
as soon as you have set the features on your pictures , you can see them in your browser . so , if you have chosen all the images you can easily print , or whatever you have chosen . this is described in . after that you can use a module to copy the selected images on a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and other features can be displayed in the preview view . if you want to view categories in DR@@ E preview view , you can simply press characteristics to the images by clicking the image selected after the image has been selected . this can be seen here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case you will allow you to get &amp; get album ; on the picture to paint .
the common will not be saved with the image , but in the database . on the type you can change your own old later .
in case you can see a picture on the painted screen saver . in order to switch off the painting mode from &amp; to a Album . in order to finish the painting menu click on the painting , simply select the cross in the tool bar at the top of the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler , you must have use the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not complete , but the documentation on &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you have read and understood .
in the object tree you can choose individual objects . then , their properties are displayed in the object Properties and the object in the wire models yellow .
you can also choose several objects at the same time , but not the object of a already selected object , as all the objects are selected with the object .
to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position you want to add the object and click the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the menu Ins@@ ert .
there are multiply possible positions , the following sliding menu will end , so that you can choose the right position :
with del@@ eting either from the menu bar to work or from the context menu of the right mouse button you can remove selected objects from the scene .
if you have changed properties , click on the user to take these changes . if you have inv@@ alid values , a message is displayed using an error description . then you can check the input error and click on the application or re@@ ject the changes .
if you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; enter user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object .
you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 included the user documentation .
if you edit a texture or a part of a texture , you can see a preview of your own image view .
press the own texture view and a small example of the scene will be selected with the selected texture . as default , the whole texture is rendered , even if you want to render an inheritance in a texture map ( for example a texture in a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , cross the local texture .
screen photo shows the control points of the camera . you can pull out these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction the camera .
if a transformation is chosen , disappear the control points and it will display a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shi@@ fts . you can change the shift by pulling down with the mouse within the entire window .
each object has an illumination level . you can specify this value relative to visual level of object or as an absolute value . objects are displayed only if they are selected or their vision level smaller or equal to the scene choice of the scene of the scene .
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ eg@@ eler , has a window order as default . the object @-@ tree and the view of the object characteristics are shown on the left and the four graphical views of the right .
if you do not like the standard window order , or if you need a different arrangement , you can save them as desired . you can also save multiple windows orders and change it between different arrangements .
in order to set a window over or below a available view , drag the facade to the upper or bottom edge of a view . a rectangle shows the new position .
to create a new column , go on the right or left side of a view . the new view will then be an@@ cho@@ red on the right or left side of this view and covers the overall height .
if you would like to arrange multiple views on each other , drag the mount@@ ings in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the card reader at the top in the views .
the last possible window order are floating views : views , which are not an@@ cho@@ red in the main window . in order to solve a view from the anchor , drag the desktop on the right arrow or click on the small arrow pointing to the left arrow .
to view a view , click on the small cross in the facade bar . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can add additional views to the main window . in the menu view , you can find entries for any type of views . new views are floating , you can stack them on any spot .
the current window view can save a window of window . save a dialog box is displayed in which you can save the window regulations under an existing or new name .
if you have produced a scene , you can render it . &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ eg@@ eler ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for ren@@ ders , this program has to be installed properly . as this manual was written , &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 currently . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; version 1.0 is not supported .
to render the current scene , click on the symbol Ren@@ dering Symbol Ren@@ ders in the tool bar or select the menu entry of the scene .
a R@@ ender @-@ mode corresponds to entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of the rendering . if you want to insert a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can add any number of Excel modes , from a fast preview of up to full images in highest quality .
if you click on the icon The R@@ ender settings in the tool bar or select menu setting ... , the following dialog will be opened :
each R@@ ender Mode has a name . you can enter any name , but sense is a name that can recognize the features of the mode .
in the map size you can do the width and height of the rounded image . if you want to render only a small area of the image , select the check box below and give the image section to ren@@ ders in the input fields .
in combination @-@ field quality you can choose the properties that use &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; this is used by a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user reflection light . a detailed description of the R@@ ender features can be found in the user manual &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; .
if a picture with only a beam per pixel you can create different errors . these pictures often have a mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or batch effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is ali@@ asing .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technology called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to decrease the influence of this error . generally pictures are better with this feature better .
when you turn off Anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates &amp; connects &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than a beam per pixel . this technique is called super sampling .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super sampling . as a standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because the second method is adap@@ tive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sive because each pixels is sub@@ du@@ ously split and adap@@ tive because the detection depth are depending on the calculated color values .
if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray has a beam per pixel . if the difference between the color values to the neighboring pixel are processed , a grid of 4x4 additional points will be charged , a grid of 4x4 additional points will be charged , at a depth of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
di@@ ff = abs ( r . 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays each pixel . if the difference is divided between the color values , then the pixels is divided into 4 sub@@ pixels that can be checked separately and on additional sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the record allows you to adjust with the depth value .
another possibility to reduce ali@@ asing effect is the generation of noise for the beam process called J@@ itter@@ ing . if you place J@@ itter@@ ing , changing &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular samples .
the last setting for quality of the ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the diff@@ use light refle@@ ct@@ ance is calculated . it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this feature .
on this card card you can adjust if the alpha @-@ channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent if the corresponding illumin@@ ants have no object .
opens a new window for displaying &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly , you can find the reason why .
to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ Sc@@ ene scene , select the menu entry file impor@@ ting ... and select a file in the dialog window .
currently , &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ eg@@ eler does not support the full command line of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; when impor@@ ting error messages or war@@ nings , a dialog window displays a list of all messages .
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler , write this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ k@@ in and / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object tree into the editor to import the source text file into the editor . to import objects into the scene , select the source code in the editor and drag it to the object tree .
copying and inser@@ ting into &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler , and in your editor you can also insert sources for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also in your editor .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called if &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ eg@@ eler is running . usually this is p@@ ov@@ ray or x @-@ p@@ ov@@ ray .
when you click on the own image view , click &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ eg@@ eler ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation on the displayed object . set up the path to your document &apos;s re@@ tention and version 1 . it supports versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; sear@@ ches for external files ( e.g. al@@ ti@@ ring data ) in the paths to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ libraries . if you enter files that are not in the folder of the scene , you must also enter the path to these files here , if a file is used in different paths of the library , the first spot@@ ted file is used .
the color for wire @-@ models . the second color is used to display the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected control points .
the colour of rectangle in the camera view and in the window type markings .
you can set the object of objects on the grid in the context menu of the wire @-@ model views . you can set the grid separately for shi@@ fts , sc@@ aling and tor@@ tures .
larger values indicate an accurate wire model and thus a better sewing unit for the displayed objects , but require more time to ren@@ ders . for some objects like the ball you can set the detail level for two directions .
if you cross the high detail shots for extended proj@@ ections , all wire @-@ model views are further divided , all proj@@ ections are using the perspective and the vertical proj@@ ections . this property gives a better approach to proj@@ ections , but requires more time to rendering .
when you cross the wall , a wall is mounted behind the objects . the wall is depicted in a ch@@ board pattern with two adjustable colours .
if you cross the bottom , a floor is placed below the objects . the floor is depicted in a ch@@ board pattern with two adjustable colours .
if you check in can@@ ons , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for the Ren@@ dering of the scenes . values for depth and sw@@ elling can be set . precise information about the parameters you will find in section R@@ ender modes .
on this site , you can modify the existing window arrangements or create new window arrangements in the window accounts , how to create and store window arrangements .
the Combin@@ ation field Standard Window System : displays all existing window arrangements . &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; the chosen window order is used during the start of the program .
the list of lim@@ iting window orders shows all existing window arrangements . a new arrangement can be created with the button and delete a selected arrangement with the button .
any window order is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list below the name shows all the views of the chosen window order . new views can create and delete selected views with the button .
the position of the new window . with new column you create a new column on the right @-@ hand side of the existing window , with incorrect card , you will receive a cartridge card on the right pane and web@@ bing the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you have just &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ eg@@ eler is installed and now you would like to start more accurate knowledge of both programs . if you can follow all steps in this guide , you should have the ultimate way to create simple scene cap@@ turing very popular : a sphere on a plane .
but you should keep following war@@ nings carefully before you compl@@ ain about that you get as a result only a black screen . if you use a 3D program , you should see these important rules :
if you do no camera , no rules can be applied for the rendering , as a result you get a black image .
if you don &apos;t include any light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you will get just a black picture .
if you have any fault @-@ free installed , you will see at the first start of &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler , the following pre@@ set window mapping :
take a little time to know the menus and the existing symbols of the tool bar . read the documentation that you can expect a reasonable show what you can expect from this program .
they are often used to use these menus and symbols now , therefore you should remember the menus and symbols and their application .
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ eg@@ eler ; starts with a simple scene . in order to remove this guide , you must first remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then choose the menu entry . so you now have a scene without objects .
the wire model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene you generate . in particular , note that in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) , this is the view of the scene from the view@@ point of the camera . this shows you the result of the scene of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the designation camera . if you click on it , see the content of the view object Properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; you will find further details .
do not change anything at the basic settings of the camera , this is later instructions reserved , but note that the camera to change control points . simply click with the left mouse button on a control point , and drag him to the desired position .
if you press the button on the user or the input buttons , the wire @-@ model views and the object tree immediately change this settings . as a result , they see the scene from the view@@ point of the camera .
there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . you might set a Qu@@ ader ( insertion body tor@@ ader ) and size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 but this is a smooth approach to solve this task .
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ eg@@ eler is actually a simple way . you can use an infinite level as the ground :
a good advice : choose the plane in the object tree , change the name and press the button on the or the type . in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wire model view is also displayed at the moment , even at the moment only as a limited level . if you ren@@ ders the scene , the plane extends up to the horizon .
if you can see the object tree exactly , you can see the default options for each new object . in this case , you will find only the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation , and move . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the object characteristics .
in this scene , you should move the floor to exercise a unit under the line , just to know some of these parameters . choose shift and set values as follows :
first choose the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose a little bit simple at the moment .
in both cases a dialog box opens in which you may choose to insert how the object is inserted . you can change the name in the self @-@ image view ( name = bottom pigment ) , with a click on the button preview you see how the pigment looks now .
of course the preview of the pigments only shows a flat black material , because you can always have settings for the pigment even . do you always remember to check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview . also , there are many possibilities for the pigment . however , there are many possibilities now , but now take the easiest .
if you do not see any color on Qu@@ ilt and ball in the preview , click the button on the user and then call the preview .
the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your image with one click on the symbol , you should obtain the following result :
of course , these are not the colour . you need to enter two new attributes . in the color list you need two new attributes . then you can do this entry twice ( you can do this also more often , but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
choose object @-@ tree every time and change the colors in the view of the object Properties :
this step , you should already be able to run , as you &apos;ve already understood the general operation of &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler , the ball can be just as easy as the floor :
in the view of the object properties you can change the settings immediately . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( don &apos;t forget the input on the floor ) so that the ball is poured out over the ground as you have moved the floor to a unit down@@ wards .
of course , the Ren@@ dering is now a self @-@ featured result : as already before , the ball surface appears like a matt black material . set the following steps a suitable material .
if you have selected the ball , you can now add a material . as in the ground , insert the ball a pigment as color :
first , choose the subject and change the name for example in the ball pigment . click on ball pigment , then dial colour and set the values as follows :
but you can reach more interesting effects if you take the time , to set some finish properties :
then change the values like in the following screen photos and click on users or press the type of input .
the brightness of shine effect and reflection have already some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrome finish , even if metal is not selected :
you should now have a good impression of what ways to give you &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler . hop@@ efully , you have already learned as much as you can create simple but nice scenes .
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ cing is a R@@ ender Method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
when you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing a Sc@@ ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ts from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that reflects the scenes ) by each pixel in the scene . the calculated effects of the light sources in the scene and as the atmospheric effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects can be handled as an example of fog .
as you can imagine , you will see without a camera , the camera is your eye to view the scene . without a light source , you can also see anything , the picture is simply black . obviously , any scene , which should be ger@@ m@@ apped , some light sources and at least one camera .
in common file dialog , you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the default file dialog , you can select a file that you have created before using &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler
whenever you open a new model or create , the file is inserted into this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it is stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you need to enter a name and a disk space .
the scene in the last stored version is re@@ produced . all changes since the last storage are rejected .
you can only select this menu entry if you do not have any stored changes in the scene .
repeat the last reverse order . this menu entry allows you to select only if you have used to work on the reverse .
saves the current win@@ dings and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or an existing arrangement .
in this menu , you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler , here you can change the look , the keyboards and default behavior .
opens a dialog for changing the short@@ cut . you can change or add commands to use this option for &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; -@@ Comm@@ ands or adding new commands .
opens a dialog for setting up the tool bar . you can add and remove the tool symbols for &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler .
a dump map is an option to furn@@ ish rough surfaces without changing any hi@@ ves on the surface without changing the geomet@@ rical form of the object itself .
it is custom@@ ary to use the same file for both a B@@ ump Map and also for a texture map .
basic bodies are simple geomet@@ ric shapes that can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens of or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then processed , to give them a realistic appearance .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis , by using an image file as color chart .
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser that you can select images to display .
pictures can be displayed in a own window in the size of the image or full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is very easy . the file browser lists files that you can display with click &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or button Return .
you can adjust if any image is displayed in one own window , or if all images should always use the same window .
if you are looking for a specified file , just type the first sign of the file in the browser window . if a matching date is found , the file is highlighted . you can rely on the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in the dialog setup - &amp; ku@@ ick@@ ed ; there are five ant@@ lers . in three of them , General and editing and sli@@ deshow , you can adjust the work of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ ed . in the two others , short @-@ commands for the browser you can set the short@@ cut for the respective windows .
if this is selected , then the pictures will be opened in full screen mode . if the image is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with background color that you can set down below . default is not full screen mode .
is this point activ@@ ates , load &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; already the next image in the folder , while you still read the current picture . this reduces the delay when you choose the next image , and it is especially suitable for a slide show .

you can see &amp; ku@@ dos ; so , only some of the file types are displayed , which can also display the program .
this option is switched to the full screen for large images to the full screen . this option is switched on as default .
select whether the sli@@ deshow is to begin with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
the time span between the image changes in a slide show . in order to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the small arrows right next to the input field . default is 3 seconds .
the number of repet@@ itions . is this value to 0 , the sli@@ deshow is repeated as long until they are returned from the user . to enter the value , you can use a new value in the input field or use the small arrows right next to the input field . default is 1 .
click here the key short@@ cut for different operation modes of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ ed ; in the card postcards short@@ com@@ ings for the display windows and short commands for your browser .
using this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folder and a window for the files ) and the partial view of the file system with folders and files in a window .

&amp; sk@@ et@@ ite ; is an application for scanning of pictures , which does not make more images than p@@ ans and removing labels .
&amp; sk@@ et@@ ite ; is an easy application to scan and sc@@ utt@@ les . &amp; sk@@ et@@ ite ; can open a dialog for any picture or save the pictures immediately in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can also display the images before storing .
you can check the status of your scanner on the soft @-@ project side by using the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ projected ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set at the command line of &amp; sk@@ et@@ ite ; with the command sk@@ et@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in terminal can be set . if this scanner is not opened , or if no standard scanner is opened , a dialog will be opened for selecting the scanner .
the user can select the scanner and press OK to open the scanner . stop and finish off .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ et@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) will not be treated with these options .
in order to create a picture , the user can run only a pre@@ amplifier and then check scanning area for the final scan . the preview can be launched by the preview button .
to select the image better than select the user in the image and out of the current selection out . it can also adjust the zoom so that the complete preview fits into the window .
if the image has been selected , the final image can be read with the scan button .
if before store a preview can be selected in the settings , then the picture will be displayed in a preview window , as below is displayed , then the picture will be saved and sh@@ lie ? EN leads to a break and you come back into the main window .
thanks to the button settings the same named dialog is opened in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user may preview the image if desired , before saving . in this case , the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview cannot be desired , then the option must be selected .
this setting allows them to select the way as &amp; sk@@ et@@ ite ; images stores the dialog for saving any picture . if &amp; sk@@ et@@ ite will open the dialogue in front of any called image . if &amp; sk@@ et@@ ite , it will automatically save with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you have to save save without any file names .
this setting defines where images are stored at option Save without any file names . if the images are saved after each scan , this folder will be used as standard for the dialog for saving . the default value is your home directory and you can change it with the button .
this parameter defines a picture pre@@ fix for automatically storing images and is also the proposed name for the image in dialog for saving . the automatically saved picture gets a num@@ eric suff@@ ix of each time when a picture is stored . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can adjust the image quality for saving image quality . this value changes also the compression value in saving . if select the image quality not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the button help starts the K@@ DE help with the &amp; sk@@ et@@ ite ; -@@ manual . the button above starts the K@@ DE about dialog for &amp; sk@@ et@@ ite ; the button settings shows the dialog for Settings and Cl@@ ose can be used to end &amp; sk@@ et@@ ite .

the D@@ COP interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions , mostly in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and should describe the D@@ COP @-@ functions of collection , context @-@ browser , players , playlist , playlist for the D@@ COP @-@ function break might look &amp; z@@ b ; look like this :
Amar@@ ok also supports command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; Amar@@ ok also has some own command line options .
you should give the user a feedback if the script can not be done because of a missing depen@@ dency . please check in your script , whether all required modules are present and check the dialog for allowing users to know why a script does not running .
Beg@@ in require &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um &apos; ( K@@ DE bin@@ dings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings V@@ 3.4 is set for this script . &apos; en@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit
in the file scripts / templates you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as a base for your own scripts , or simply expand the required functions . they will quickly find that the writing of scripts is relatively simple .
using D@@ COP , your scripts can be exchanged with Amar@@ ok and controls Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is the use of command d@@ co@@ p ; which should be bending with every K@@ DE installation .
most scripts are able to execute external programs and commands . additionally , the function ex@@ ec ( ) is used in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; is relatively easy to be called . here is an example in Python :
&amp; am@@ way ; sends al@@ erts to all running scripts . in this reason , scripts are obliged to monitor the default scripts and react according to events . of course , a script may ignore the events even if it has no use for it .
configure the script to indicate the setup dialog . in order to store the saving and loading of the setup data , Amar@@ ok reli@@ es the folder to the folder where all data should be stored .
track@@ Change Sign@@ alizes that a new piece is played . the script could now retri@@ eve &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ COP features further information about the new piece ( for example , the met@@ ad@@ ata or the unit length ) .
volum@@ et@@ Change new@@ Volume sign@@ alizes a change of volume . the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ iz@@ u@@ cked : sub@@ menu , Cont@@ ains the path to the selected files of playlist , if set a custom menu entry , you can use the D@@ COP @-@ function d@@ co@@ p am@@ per@@ script script Men@@ u@@ Item ( Sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Title ) . in order to remove one entry , you can use d@@ co@@ p am@@ way script conditions . e@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Item ( Sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Title ) .
before &amp; when the user is terminated ; or if the user stops a script , sends &amp; am@@ arok ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M will be able to do the script . this signal should be processed to do . for example , the saving of data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ oks script administration can also install script packages which can be compressed using a web server . such pack@@ ets are basically normal T@@ ar Archive ( .t@@ ar ) , which can be optionally detected with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) , that the user can clearly recognize the archive as a Amar@@ ok script package .
&amp; am@@ arok ; 1.3 will only accept script pack@@ ets with the extension of amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason you should use your script packages equal right .
the main cre@@ pt must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining to loading modules should not be increased . use the T@@ sar parameter -@@ p to get the file right :
when your script package is ready , you can go up to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and get the link to the Wik@@ i scripts side of &amp; am@@ arok ; for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category am@@ way ; scripts use .
&amp; am@@ arok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; it &apos;s a lot of useful and powerful features and is yet easy to use .
with &amp; am@@ way ; you can move music easily into the playlist , instead of endless menus . perhaps you are looking for just a certain title from thousands of thousands in your collection . with &amp; am@@ arok ; &apos;s Colle@@ ct @-@ Browser and the Quick Search will find the piece within seconds .
you might have already some playlist , but you can never choose which you want to hear ? then the playlist , then , is the right choice for you . and if the decision is still difficult , select the dynamic mode and the smart playlist automatically according to certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers IF@@ P and many gen@@ eric USB devices . Moreover , many different audio systems make Amar@@ ok for the most advanced audio player . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right to experience your music !

relative path for manually saved playlist : if you activate this setting , is &amp; am@@ way ; relative path to music files , starting from the location of the playlist , otherwise it will be the absolute position of music files .
actual piece when changing the unit is obvious that the playlist windows rolls , in order to keep in the visible window range always in the visible window .
in the change@@ over to the context browser , automatically changes the context browser as soon as the next one is played .
in the appearance of the appearance you can custom@@ ize &amp; am@@ way ; the appearance is divided into three parts .
in the fonts section , you can select the use of different scriptures in &amp; am@@ way . you can select scriptures for the following areas : playlist windows , Player windows , and context @-@ browser . press on select ... , so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog .
with the selection of customized color scheme you can set the tor@@ ment of choice and can set your own color scheme . do this , using it activated colour scheme for front and background color .
play at the start , make that &amp; am@@ arok branches ; after program launch the playback will automatically grow with the piece on the spot , with which they stopped at last edit .
the sub@@ window On @-@ screen display setup allows you to display on the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can preview the effect of all settings in this preview .
the first option is the font . click on select ... to select from the dialog the desired fonts for the O@@ SD . the check box sh@@ adows that the text is displayed in the O@@ SD .
own colors are giving you the possibility to custom@@ ize the O@@ SD colors for let@@ tering and background . one click on the color surfaces opens the dialog to choose color selection . if own colors are not activated , the vo@@ cle@@ ver &amp; k@@ de is used .
the input field display text presents the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by using plac@@ eholders , the O@@ SD may be adapted to your needs . below , you can find a list of available places and what they mean .
the screen is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . thus , you can define it on which screen of a multi @-@ cav@@ ity environment should appear to the O@@ SD .
the card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the selection field . some drivers are able to activate further possibilities in this card card .
the card collection is used for setting up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folder , select &amp; am@@ way ; to refer to music files . in order to include a folder in the collection , in addition to its name . this section contains also check boxes for inser@@ ting , as with the selected folders .
sub @-@ file recur@@ sive browse : this causes that &amp; am@@ arok branches ; both the crossed and their sub @-@ file to music will be as well .

am@@ aro@@ K needs only the package K@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no further K@@ DE packages . you need to have K@@ deli@@ bs ( including the programs contained therein , because &amp; am@@ arok branches ; needs some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide how to comp@@ ile K@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
some functions such as the O@@ SD predi@@ ct that your window manager will operate the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . we try to support am@@ aro@@ K on all platforms , therefore we use K@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t as these places an excellent development environment .
probably , one of your files will make an error in the Tag@@ li@@ b library for days . you can update this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b @-@ developers under bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de.@@ org and depend on the cap@@ ut@@ te file that caused the crash . after that , you can delete the file and create the collection again .
mostly it is mostly seen that Tag@@ lib when reading the met@@ a @-@ information from this file crashing . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b @-@ developers under bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de.@@ org .
if you use MySQL as a database , then try SQ@@ Lite . the support for it in &amp; am@@ way ; is somewhat more mature .
make sure all of &amp; am@@ way ; used libraries with the same compiler version compiled . if e.g. &amp; am@@ way ; with GCC 3.4 , Tag@@ li@@ b has been compiled with GCC 3.@@ 3.x , then this leads to crash when working the met@@ a @-@ information .
if you use K@@ DE using art@@ s@@ d , then de@@ activ@@ ating the autom@@ echanika , if in@@ active for ... at the setting of sound system , or use at least a value of 1 second .
you can also send us the baking trace via e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens at a crash ) . if it is often a common crash and send us a good back@@ sli@@ d , the error is guaranteed .
this is that many programme will write data as UTF @-@ 8 to met@@ a @-@ info , but this is not known as Unicode , but the Perl script exec@@ utes the problem .

after the start of &amp; am@@ arok branches ; only a blank playlist , how to get there music pieces there ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files into the right part of the playlist .
to keep the surface intuitive , the start @-@ up window was converted into the Statistics window . you will find it under ex@@ tras statistics .
the significance of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are standing for the evaluation by the user , while the points are calculated automatically .
to evaluate pieces , the evaluation box must be displayed in the playlist and select column . click somewhere in the new evaluation column to define the evaluation for a piece . you can also use the short @-@ commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove , and then press release on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then choose from playlist menu .
drag a playlist with the mouse to the playlist and let them fall there , just as you would do it with other files , just as it is : - )
in the tool bar of the playlist , right next to adding button , is the button playlist . click on it .
presumably the X@@ M@@ MS @-@ config file is missing completely . install the X@@ M@@ MS @-@ dev@@ el package and install &amp; am@@ arok ; new . look at lib@@ visual , this package includes many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations .

no . yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; am@@ arok ; uses one of the back@@ end independent approach , therefore , the actual question are Which media types supports G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we support so pretty every single audio format . tracks can even run text and PNG !
it may be ! perhaps you can use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , where the default does not have any MP3 decoder . solution : Alt @-@ F2 , g@@ g : Red@@ hat mp3 k@@ de , input
the Ya@@ ST online update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . well , so ... &amp; am@@ way ; plays MP3 &apos;s from : - )
if you use the g@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa @-@ S@@ ink , the device must use a bl@@ ender . a mixer allows several applications to use the device at the same time and can be used simultaneously . this can be achieved through a sound card with hardware mixer ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( software @-@ mixer ) .
the edition of this command should help you in search of the problem cause and a solution . for g@@ amer , you may need to specify another S@@ ink ( e.g. oss@@ sink ) .
that does &amp; am@@ arok branches ; already . do not forget that media must be de@@ coded for most people if you &apos;re looking for a decoration or with little overhead . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ coded it and transm@@ its the PCM data to AL@@ SA . exactly like X@@ M@@ MS .
X@@ M@@ MS encoded the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can display directly to AL@@ SA , precisely like x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open sound server with highest priority ( real @-@ time value ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( call , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ sw@@ ra@@ pper SU@@ ID is set :

read the scanning FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask in the I@@ RC @-@ Channel # g@@ stre@@ amer .
try this ( ending am@@ aro@@ K before ! ) : - Download V1 video files , comp@@ ile and install it . then remove G@@ ST files from once a system administrator and once again as your normal user . delete the module file with G@@ ST @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer config ( you will find the module folder with G@@ ST @-@ config / g@@ lim@@ b @-@ config ) and run G@@ ST regi@@ sters . start now &amp; am@@ arok branches .

&amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ k@@ not@@ ch ; : burn all types of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all functions that have also &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; usually , &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; for burning CDs out . in some cases , &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; however , has achieved a higher quality with burnt audio CDs .
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) . on the Internet , such programs are referred to as a Ripper .
OGG Vor@@ bis Library : OGG Vor@@ bis is an entirely open , patented and professional technology for the audio encoding and for use with audio data streams . OGG Vor@@ bis is advant@@ age@@ ous of open source and is available in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by the O@@ g@@ g Vor@@ bis decoder and encoder modules .
M@@ ad : this is a high quality MPEG @-@ 1 decoder and supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder module .
l@@ ame : a well developed MP3 decoder , which can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial en@@ co@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 encoder module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source co@@ dec for los@@ s@@ less audio compression and compression . it is used from the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio encoder module , so that you can read FLA@@ C files .
dra@@ gon@@ d@@ file , FF@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack Decoder : more libraries for processing various audio formats . with FF@@ m@@ peg , it is possible to de@@ cryp@@ t WMA files to burn them on a audio CD .
SO@@ X : an auxiliary program that can convert between different audio formats and convert . SO@@ X will be used from SO@@ X audio encoder module .
trans@@ code : a command line program for video editing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ CD@@ Im@@ ager : an functionality fully equipped car system for editing , dis@@ assembling and analyze video CDs and super @-@ video CDs .
norm@@ alize sound files : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files on a standard level . this may be useful for creating a mixed CD &apos;s and Mp3 collections ; without norm@@ alize the different input level of the various albums to the un@@ beautiful effect , the music pieces can be re@@ produced differently .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : here is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to run from CD and play all videos in the basic folder of the CD .
this is a comfortable way to download projects recently opened projects . the corresponding sub@@ menu provides a list of these projects . one click will open the project .
saves the current project . if the project was saved once , the previously created file is checked , otherwise it will be asked for a new fil@@ en@@ ames .
saves the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ame . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save As is displayed , with which you can choose the folder and file name for the project file .
saves all of the open projects . this is the same as you would save to store your individual project file .
includes the current project . if a project has changed and not stored , asks &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; according to what happened . you can then choose between saving and changes . Moreover , you can also break the closing and keep the project so open .
includes all open projects . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; it will be wonder@@ ing for any of the stored project , so that you would have called for each project file .
includes all open projects and ends &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; for each not stored project , what should be done as if you have called on .
when you retri@@ eve this entry , you can choose the same effect as if you check the files directly from the upper view to the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files will be released in the basic folder of the CD .
open the dialogue &quot; Bur@@ ning &quot; for the current project . this dialogue is basically the same as the features of the project . the only difference is the additional knob burning , the &amp; K@@ 3@@ b . burning dialog can only be opened when the project has already contains data .
opens the features dialog for the current project . here you can set many proj@@ ections settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of them are described ? help ( easily accessed via the right mouse button ) .
this entry appears only for an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this is useful if you don &apos;t use files for a multi @-@ session CD . the data from the previous session will always be used , even if this function is not used , so that you can see the files already existing files and folders .
this entry appears only for an active data CD / DVD or Video @-@ DVD project . this function is hated &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; , imported files from the current project . this function is removed no files from the medium , it bl@@ ends only the previously imported files .
open the CD copying dialog . this allows you to burn a copy of a CD to another medium . alternatively , you can also use a copy of a CD , which you would also prefer to burn if you want to copy CDs with def@@ ective sectors or video CDs .
then open the DVD copying dialog . this allows you to burn a DVD to another medium . alternatively , you can also need to burn a DVD with the help of the copying dialog . alternatively , the target medium is not enough to be able to record the entire ( video ) data of the source media in the original form .
opens the dialog for del@@ etion of a CD @-@ RW . so you can delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
open the dialog for form@@ ating a DVD . with this dialogue you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) format , which makes the contents completely deleted . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b . lets you choose your choice between writing modes and incre@@ mental .
bur@@ ns a previously produced CD image . the dialog asks you to a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as data source , which is then not supported by pressing the pressing button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , but you have to use other tools such as # # 2@@ I@@ so . )
bur@@ ns a previously produced DVD image . the dialog asks you to a * .@@ is@@ o file as data source , which then can be burned instantly .
a previously used DVD video can be converted . this dialog window will usually help you to read a DVD in the ingredients , but can also be used too . it contains information about the le@@ ased video , codi@@ fication settings and even opportunities for changing the size and cut black edges .
shows information about the inserted medium . these information are displayed in the summar@@ ies and include features of the media , such as size and title length of CD or DVD .
shows a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; when an entry is crossed , the tool bar is currently visible in the main window .
if this is crossed , a small l@@ ath at the bottom edge of the window will be displayed . it contains information about the status of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not crossed , the status bar is hidden .
the folder view is an overview of your folder and CD / DVD drives . if the content is enabled , the content is shown in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as Media Info , Sper@@ ing and un@@ lock the disk or throw out the media .
the summar@@ izes view is an or out . the syn@@ op@@ sis view allows you to select and drag files to the project view . the included view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , if a drive with an appropriate CD / DVD in folder screen has been selected .
the head bar is activated in the project view or from . the head bar is a narrow area that has only visible even if the project view has no real function , it looks pretty pretty and separates the project view clearly from the remaining views .
this opens a dialog box for changing the keyboard arrangements for &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after one of the available commands selected in the upper part you can adjust the key order down below .
this is launching the K@@ 3@@ b ; setup assistant . this makes the correct per@@ missions to burn CDs and DVDs . therefore , system administrator privileg@@ es are required , therefore you need to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) .
opens the settings of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; here you can do general program settings . almost all functions of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; should work on An@@ h@@ ie@@ b . this dialogue is intended for Person@@ alize and fine tuning of the program .
&amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; is as many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also , with one &amp; D@@ COP ; interface equipped . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled via a sh@@ ell@@ .com .
to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; to use functions , you can use either the command line program d@@ co@@ p , or the somewhat more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in functional scope , therefore rather your taste and the type of your task is decisive in which the routine you can give them .
in this chapter , we assume that you can use the command line program d@@ co@@ p . to make use the &amp; D@@ COP ; you need to make sure that &amp; K@@ 3@@ b is started . then enter something like the following at the console :
besides the general &amp; D@@ COP ; functions , all &amp; k@@ de ; program common , supports &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; mostly two other parts , which are described below .
the standard D@@ COP interface of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions such as cop@@ y@@ CD , format DVD and further functions for creating new projects .
D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ at@@ e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ at@@ e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ at@@ e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ at@@ e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ at@@ e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ at@@ e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) Speci@@ alist C@@ dr@@ w ( ) , Bur@@ n@@ d@@ d@@ image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) , bur@@ n@@ d@@ v@@ d@@ image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result such a cre@@ at@@ e@@ XX@@ X@@ project method , you can produce a D@@ COP @-@ reference to the newly created project : # K@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project using # d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project . using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Pro@@ ject@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above @-@ listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Pro@@ ject@@ interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Pro@@ ject@@ Interface , which can only be used on data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
the cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String Name ) , cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String Name , Q@@ String Par@@ ent ) , add@@ ur@@ l ( K@@ URL : : List UR@@ Ls , Q@@ String Par@@ ent ) , the e@@ Item ( Q@@ String path ) , ren@@ ame@@ Item ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String new@@ Name ) .
this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , multiple folders and then add files into the new folder :
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der gra@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT add@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT add@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der / fo@@ o / home / tru@@ eg / set fil@@ e.@@ t@@ xt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; is an audio CD ; runs for &amp; k@@ de ; with it you can easily read audio CD ; s can be read and stored in MP3 or OGG files . other formats are possible , depending on the encoder that is installed on the computer .
&amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for the reading of &amp; CD ; -@@ data in WAV files on the hard drive ) and from many Ko@@ di@@ ers , which are currently supported for MP3 , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs and FLA@@ C ( this co@@ dec packages must still be added from the Linux distribution ) . additional co@@ dec can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first the title of the &amp; CD will be read and stored in WAV files on the computer ( los@@ s@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step , these WAV files are generally compressed into MP3 or OGG format , or in other formats like the los@@ s@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; it is compiled by &amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost any distribution has compiled a pre@@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this has to be done now .
for the second step is l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ pre@@ bis ( for OGG ) or other co@@ dec . all these programs are already installed for any Linux distri@@ butions that are not necessary to comp@@ ile it . however , if FLA@@ C is not used , the installation will not be required .
what encoding / file format should be used ? the chapter cat@@ cher co@@ dec is a small introduction to co@@ dec , audio quality and compression factors .
a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia , to read the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not possible to avoid any copy protection . in any case &amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; even avoid the mechanisms of copy protection . avoid simply the purchase of copy protected audio CD ; s !
while inser@@ ting only once ( the setup dialog can be found so often up to a suitable configuration ) , it will be explained by daily handling to read a &amp; CD ; this leads ( hop@@ efully ) to facilitate the slim approach of the user interface , which you will be proud in the beginning .
can convert in many formats - depending on which coding programs are installed ( MP3 , OGG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can record &amp; CD ; retri@@ eve the fre@@ ed@@ b from the internet or can fully work completely without network , whereby everything is recorded manually .
this is just a brief list of the commands of the main window . on the page step by step , you will find more information on how this program is used as well as screens with descriptions of the tab for the configuration of the program .
the CD@@ DB request of the CD data is based on request by the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be locally or online , in the latter case must first be connected to the Internet . )
start reading and - if a encoder is configured in the encoding parameter settings in the setup code - the coding .
a sub @-@ menu opens with a list of available encoder , so that the selection of any other encoder can be read as default . it is noted that before the encoder is configured in the tab dialog box dialog .
opens the file manager , allowing a already read file to en@@ code instead of a complete &amp; CD ; read and en@@ code .
opens the instruction dialog for configur@@ ing the noti@@ fications ( such as protocols , pi@@ ep@@ tics ) for programming ( such as reading &amp; CD ; terminated ) .
opens the main setup dialog of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; with various cartridge cards ( such as Encoder , to set the En@@ co@@ ders ) . here you need to go before the program can successfully be used !
this chapter describes sound quality , co@@ dec and compression ratios and helps you choose the right body .
if no audio information is to be lost , there is no loss @-@ free audio format . besides FLA@@ C , there are also other such as &apos; hormone &apos; or &apos; Monkey &apos; , which may be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are the low compression ratios and barely available commercial devices that can play this files .
among the audio formats supported by data comp@@ ress according to their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and OGG are the most common . OGG may today have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit@@ rate the differences are less important because both co@@ ders produce very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ n@@ &apos;@@ n@@ so &apos; free , l@@ ame is still delivered with most distri@@ butions of free , but there are open license questions
+ high up to very high sound quality ( with high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to OGG slightly lower quality with deeper bitter@@ ness .
OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG players are available .
MP3 - When music is also heard on other devices such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB Stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special Auto @-@ stereo systems . today - at the beginning of 2009 these devices only support MP3 format .
a short list with parameters to audio quality and resulting compression ratios for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for other parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set medium &apos; = This setting provides good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set standard &apos; = This option should usually offer good transparency for most people and most of the music pieces acceptable , and has quite high quality . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . needs always 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a tit@@ els . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR Communal stereo , compression rate of approx . 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a tit@@ els . good enough for music of young people , portable devices and car travel systems . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set F@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting is ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you have absolutely the absolutely highest quality , then choose this setting .
the &amp; CD ; written manually , or by the program automatically generated from the fre@@ ed@@ b over the Internet , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / used with &amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; and the codi@@ fication program to generate the folder and file names and the characteristics of music files .
in connection with Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ections , there are often a combination of program settings for the coding and these parameters here . the manual or aid to the codi@@ ers explain the switch for these programs .
for example , to add the &amp; CD ; titles to the Key@@ words ( English : day ) add to MP@@ 3s with l@@ ame , the switch is to be added by l@@ ame and title parameters of &amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; parameters that can be used ( = button name in the assistant ) :
this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database to download the information up / enter , so that all other information can be downloaded on the calcul@@ ator . it is too note that this text is spoken only by Text : &amp; CD ; title , artist , name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not by the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( default ) is not attor@@ ney . however , no one can prevent the information on the &amp; CD ; and there is also the information without the &amp; CD ; it can neither be added to the artist nor the music company . all information can be done by a b@@ ypass through a &amp; CD ; business , physically or virtu@@ ell .
in &amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; is active as a check box ( sending an address ) to use one another ( counter@@ f@@ eit ) address than those used in the system . in this type of configuration , it seems , however , the e @-@ mail address is not used when using the server ( this can only know the programmer to check the code . )
there are many countries copies from the main database . if &amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; for use of fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographic at the next rec@@ umbent server will be used , this saves bandwidth in the network and compens@@ ates the load between the machines .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org delivers a current list of mirrors for online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information while reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the entire database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of database .
which read@@ out program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; save in WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ors that it is used to know more detailed , searching in the source code .... This was always the best choice for watching audio CD ; s . note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package from the appropriate distribution must be installed first if this is not yet done .
for saving the stored WAV files can be selected the co@@ dec and therefore select the desired file format . in the first opening , pre@@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a los@@ s@@ less comp@@ ressing for audio data ) can be added to the encoding of the body . other co@@ dec can be added to this tab .
the Ko@@ di@@ erer package must be installed from the current Linux distribution before the co@@ dec can be used . this is also necessary for pre@@ defined co@@ dec . more information about co@@ dec are in the chapter cat@@ cher co@@ dec .
after installing a Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers , more information about the switch can be obtained via the input of a command like l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . it must be replaced by the name of the installed Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers .
this can have many reasons . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the writing and readers of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) are installed . try both programs with a command line in a terminal . that could be a note that is wrong .
check if you do not want to read a copy protected audio CD ; check out the case of &amp; CD ; this will not work too !
there is a chapter with a step by step for example . even if you use other settings , this will give you how to proceed .
did you read the complete manual , everything understood , but are still uns@@ af@@ e what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you &apos;ll get enough information to set up those areas that you want to make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , all setup and our first &amp; CD . we &apos;ll use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; to create MP@@ 3s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 samples ( tags ) .
there are c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found for example with a search engine , as it is not completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to comp@@ ile the source files , which can of course always do .
please ensure that the directory / usr / share / cd insi@@ sts and that you own write permission ( eg ; by trying to copy the cross @-@ quer@@ or a bit ) .
the first section covers the basic set of &amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; something probably is done only once and
the second section describes this approach to read out a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for every issu@@ ing &amp; CD ; to be repeated .
here we determine the used co@@ dec for compression of music ( l@@ ame ) and the audio format ( --@@ pre@@ set extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) , it is determined where the files are saved and what structure is used . since we are la@@ zy , we divide the program to download the fre@@ ed@@ b and download the data from the internet .
although we can change this settings at any time , we will probably not be able to read any &amp; CD at any time , if the appropriate settings are found .
the device name is presented to the reader program to read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces can be read .
often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive . if this is not working or if more than a &amp; CD ; / DVD drive can also be specified , a look at the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the available entries of the device design@@ ations for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the map general settings . here you don &apos;t need to do much . here , a additional transformation can be defined here . in our example , everything will be shown as shown / entered as shown in screen photo .
only for incomplete information , so that you will be informed when using keywords ( tags ) are missing .
the card CD ; -@@ Settings . simply select both entries . we are convenient and leave the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : the computer must be connected during the reading of the &amp; CD ; it can be connected to the Internet so that it can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
the second selection field is simple , a &amp; CD ; it is displayed immediately , if you are un@@ happy with the database entry and the resulting directories names / fil@@ en@@ ame or tag entries , you can change it easily . the directory or record name will be changed using conv@@ ection - &gt; um@@ ren@@ ame and the ID3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; tag@@ ger .
apart from this example it is further to note : if you want to manually enter the select fields and fre@@ ed@@ b . however , this is about 620 MB large , superior to whether it is worth it . to fre@@ ed@@ b in open mode , the two selection fields must be selected , at least the first . mode is set up on the following map card .
CD@@ DB is for us fre@@ ed@@ b . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eval the &amp; CD ; information from the fre@@ ed@@ b server about the Internet . how to get the system that data will get the CD ? read the section on fre@@ ed@@ b . set everything as shown in screen photo .
mode : we don &apos;t download the database , we want to work only with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB server : please go to the site fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org and look after a mirror server in your vicinity . on this way the load is distributed between the machines . however , this setting is likely to work as the first attempt .
both works equal to the server , because many fire@@ walls will drive the protocol 88@@ 80 , there is perhaps more luck with the protocol 80 because the &amp; HTTP ; protocol usually open to surf the Internet .
in this example , we want to transmit no &amp; CD ; data to the fre@@ ed@@ b servers should be sufficient . the first check box should be sufficient .
simply take the settings of screen photo . ( make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
number of simultaneous pieces : exc@@ use , is there any reason why more than one at one time when using existing drive ? parallel reading and en@@ code ? the author doesn &apos;t know it itself .
CD ; after reading the last piece : cross this to the &amp; CD ; at the end of the trial .
user @-@ defined file for temporary files : if you cross this cruci@@ fix , then the path / folders can be checked , if only space on another drive is available . does not forget to make files in private folders . do not forget this folder when you want to make something with WAV files .
all of this way enter as it is on screen photo . the command is something long , under circumstances should be b@@ lown to the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3s . as previously mentioned , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is about 224 - 256 k@@ g. . it achieved compression factor 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the record &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the limitation of tags on version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos;@@ ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can be deleted as needed . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the names of the input file ( including the complete path ) and output file ( including the complete path ) .
use the rest as in screen photo . some comments for future use outside this sample :
number of simultaneously encoded WAV files : with a Du@@ al@@ core or Quad@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine can be tried to en@@ code more than a WAV file simultaneously .
this is , we have just finished the basic device of &amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; this configuration is used as standard for each reading of a &amp; CD ; if you chose the organis@@ ational structure of your music smart , you never need to change it again .
in this section it is described , as the process of the reading of the &amp; CD is described . we will create MP3 files . first , a connection to the internet is built . first , a connection to the internet is built , as we are convenient and the &amp; CD ; data from fre@@ ed@@ b is needed . the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each issu@@ ing &amp; CD .
since we use a &amp; CD which is not included in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen photos will see a bit differently than those for a &amp; CD ; you will learn how to manually enter the &amp; CD , instead of taking them from the Internet . comments are to be displayed on the differences .
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
if this is not yet done , the &amp; CD must now be defined in the drive which was defined in the main window .
after a short moment the pieces and its length should be listed in the window , as in screen photo . this only if the &amp; CD ; as audio CD ; could be identified and identified by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this is not done , then look for questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD ; successfully collected by the fre@@ ed@@ b , all tracks of the pieces have already been completed and additionally the name of the artist and the album are shown .
for the case it is more than an entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; Key to your &amp; CD ; provides a window , and you can select the database entry , which your opinion is best to your &amp; CD .
if you don &apos;t have chosen the check box for the automatic query of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; you can also manually trigger the option of the first button in tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have any local database , but you will need the connection to the Internet .
E 1.2 Step 02 : the CD Editor - input of CD data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen photo . the title of the piece in the first row of the &apos; Update title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist does not have to be entered into the input field &quot; Update title &quot; unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece .
the lower commentary box can be used for the individual comments of ini@@ di@@ pl@@ ell per piece , the commentary box of the album is used for comments that are valid for all the pieces of the CD .
attention : after successful retri@@ eve of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b the CD @-@ editor is not empty , but it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD @-@ editor ( e.g. if all the words are beginning or not ... ) but also to check if there are any un@@ wanted remarks .
note : in this example , we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this is limited to the length of the fields below 30 characters for the commentary , album and titles of a piece and at least 28 characters for the commentary volume . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have set up unlimited field length , at least regarding the tab setting settings ; take a look at the tab &apos; basic settings &apos; .
you can change the day information of the generated files anytime with tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
tags will not support from all codes or file formats . see the Help to the Co@@ unter to obtain more information .
simply select an entry that is obvious in the style of the expres@@ sive CD . in this example it is not important because we don &apos;t want the &amp; CD . for more information , see the website of fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org and read the information about the categories . pop or R@@ ap for example will be found under rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; go back to the main window . click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD @-@ Ed@@ itors appears again and you see that fields for the album are already filled with the entered data we have recorded for the first piece . enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . enter the title of the piece for any case and other information you wish .
click on the next line in the main window and process the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD .
attention : this window appears not if you have downloaded the data from fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories in the database .
it is the third button of the tool bar . note that the artist and the album can be displayed on the product list .
note that there is a check @-@ sign in front of each line of a piece . just a simple click on the line switches the choice of a piece or out . make sure all the items select at the bottom edge of the screen to choose all pieces at one time .
was launched by clicking on the button selection , this window appears to confirmation . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what is going on .
click on the riders orders for switching on the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool@@ bar .
this is the window for control of orders . the first piece is just read on the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the left part of the window in the status line .
this error message you see if you &apos;re trying to work with a co@@ dec you have not yet installed . pieces that have not been successfully coded with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the tmp file and the target folders are not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked if you have a write access to the folder for temporary files and the target folders ? ; - )
now it is clear how the error occurred right after the end of the balance of the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the coding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . that you can read and co@@ operate in parallel . note the status information at the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has no configuration settings to supp@@ ress this behaviour . the only thing configurable is that the number of parallel processes is un@@ clear . the machine used with a AM@@ D@@ 64 does not seem to have a problem during simultaneous operation and en@@ code ( of however two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read out , while another piece is coded and a third order is encoded on the waiting @-@ long of the body . after the last piece is coded , a small window will end with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; , you will need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x or 4.x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to generate compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG , you will need the coding of your choice .
&amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; if you know using CV@@ S as part of the k@@ dem@@ ul@@ ti@@ media package , you can download from there an anonymous copy , as &amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ package is already available . if you read this , you probably have done it already done ...
this section is aimed at people compiled by source files , and not intended for users who use a pre@@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for using the program for your needs , if it works once , then the following is correct for you :
a program that calls many different other programs , has many variants of settings . best read the step by step for example to know the options and settings . it shows screen photos of the different map cards and also includes comments for options that are not used in the example .
hello , always read on ? even if only the help menu click on the right @-@ time start of the program , without any reference point as it should go on from this somehow no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it ? who reads this , probably already the program started . it should look like this :
one bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author can &apos;t stop this manual . it is intended as the first version for a hand@@ book to &amp; audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; may it be done . at least , after contact with the author . and if you read this , he has to leave this section and agree with this proposal .
strange if you have managed to fet@@ ch the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MID@@ I@@ - and Kar@@ a@@ ok@@ es@@ Play@@ er of &amp; k@@ de ; in addition to others , he did not have some real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke @-@ real advantage of texts , the other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; &amp; k@@ de ; also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ asound project drivers , which is used for CIS cards . AL@@ SA is included when it supports a sequ@@ enz@@ er .
&amp; k@@ mid ; shows the lyrics on the screen with changing colour , so it is easy to follow the piece .
graphical display of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting buttons on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you can go in &amp; k@@ de ; any MIDI file from a &amp; @-@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows to K@@ Mid .
supports both existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( son@@ g@@ ings or tex@@ tures ) . K@@ Mid determines automatically the procedures used .
seat support . if you finish &amp; k@@ de ; during the play of a song , K@@ Mid starts again with the same song again .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for latter you need the LU@@ P drivers and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can open ... from the menu File . it appears the usual file dialog , which allows you to select the desired song .
you can also leave a file from a &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window to the &amp; k@@ mid ; windows . this also works with multiple songs simultaneously .
to play a piece of music , open it and fold the button Ab@@ play in the tool bar , select the entry Ab@@ play from the menu piece or used the fork paste .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts as soon as you draw it onto the &amp; k@@ mid ; windows . ( with several pieces it will be added to a collection and then played one another . )
once &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece play , you can jump on any spot by using the middle mouse button and drive off .
when you find that a song can be played quickly or slowly , you can click on the left and right of the speed display and then change the speed of the speed . in order to get the original temp@@ o , double click on the speed LCD .
the Le@@ ert@@ aste has two tasks : if a piece is played , a pressure on the button pause or select the menu entry in the menu appears , so the playback is played during no piece when playing , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback is played .
lyrics can be saved on two ways in a piece of music . some pieces use tex@@ sur@@ geon and others use lyrics and again others . some pieces have no text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can adjust what events are displayed automatically and even better : the event type will automatically be selected , so you will not adjust anything manually . if you have chosen nothing manually , the kar@@ aoke text will automatically be selected , but you still have the opportunity to change this if you want to see the other kind .
if you want to adjust the event of the event , select the items of tex@@ tures or son@@ g@@ ings from the menu . the same function also have the keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you can summarized . these are played by the series after playing . in this section , how to use collections efficiently .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find the collection in the menu collection under the point of Organ@@ ize .... Click there on New and give the name for the collection .
you can also copy a existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs like the original .
if you have more than a collection , you can set the data required in the collection manager .
in the temporary collection all songs you want to add to any other collection .
when leaving the application this collection is not stored . consider that if you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song by adding a song . again , it appears again the file dialog with which help you can select the desired song .
a second method to add a song depends on the setting of automatic adding to the collection .
when automatic adding to the collection is activated , a piece when opening ( using file opening or drag &amp; drop ) will be added automatically for the active collection .
when automatic add to the collection is not activated , the collection will be activated and emp@@ tied the temporary collection . this collection will then be added to the collection .
to remove a song from a collection , you must open the collection manager , select the collection and select the desired song and then click on .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you pick up the series from the sub @-@ menu sequence of the menu , the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection .
if you add songs or remove random order in the menu , the order will be reset .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager or use the selection list on the kar@@ aoke text .
to jump to a song , select the next song , the entry next song from the menu or press the arrow on the right .
to jump back a song , select the previous piece , the previous piece from the menu or press the arrow on the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select there the collection and click on the button .
temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , that doesn &apos;t matter , since it is not saved when leaving &amp; k@@ mid ; not stored .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thesizer , which are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case the MIDI @-@ Map General @-@ MIDI events in events that under@@ stands syn@@ thesizer .
for example , you can create a MIDI map , which converts all events of the change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and thus makes it a trumpet , if originally a piano should play .
if you have a sound@@ card , you don &apos;t need MIDI map because all sound cards are GM @-@ compatible ( including A@@ we and G@@ US cards , FM radio devices and so on ) .
there are unfortunately no programs to create MIDI maps , so you need to edit the appropriate file by hand ( with your favorite d@@ itor ) .
a MIDI map is a text file that stores all required conditions for playback of a piece .
each section can only appear once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MAP section , which may appear so often as desired . for this , however , every appearance has a different text ID ( see below ) .
define P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D define KE@@ Y@@ MAP &quot; name of Key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D define KE@@ Y@@ MAP &quot; An additional Key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D define CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D options ... EN@@ D
you see that it is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for options ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your Map file as e @-@ mail , that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can be used for devices that are not general @-@ MIDI compatible .
in this section , as the patches from General MIDI to your specific keyboard are shown . the general use looks as follows :
please note that the left side of the text sign will be igno@@ red . it is believed that the GM Pat@@ ches are in the right sequence ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order , and no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ key@@ s@@ To M is used to place all sounds which support this instrument using the number M ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which is similar to a def@@ amation suit . do not wear the following in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section :
so when now a MIDI file is to play a note with Patch 127 ( def@@ ences ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , regardless of which tone is available in the MIDI file .
please note that here with the concept drum @-@ patch of the patch is meant , with each tone a different per@@ kus@@ sion@@ instrument ( drum , tank , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) , and not the one that means the sound height of the same drum ( like him some keyboards ) .
the KE@@ Y@@ MAP section is used to specify how sounds are m@@ apped on a specific channel or instrument .
as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the order of lines is very important , as their presence . you must create 128 entries .
you can define several ke@@ aps for each channel and any instrument you need to use different names in the first row .
Ke@@ ym@@ aps are mainly used to build tones on the per@@ kus@@ sions channel . look at an example of the supplied Ke@@ ym@@ aps .
this section can be used to convert some channels to others . if you want to exchange the first and second channel , make it easy in the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are useful for keyboards which have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI to Channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices require 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern :
n is the channel , which is shown on the channel N , if you use the key@@ map option , of course to use the key@@ map option , of course you will ignore all events that try to change the patch on this channel . in this case you will always use Patch x .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful for example to use the per@@ kus@@ sions patch on the per@@ kus@@ sions channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der ratio will be multiplied , in which proportion of pitch @-@ Ben@@ der event is multiplied by the value n , this is used to be used with the formula n * ( r / 4096 ) and then only for@@ warded . the value 4096 is used so that in the map file does not appear dec@@ imal number .
this setting is used because GM is able to play a pitch @-@ label event with the value 4096 , to play a tone higher . unfortunately , try some key@@ boards to play at a octave up to play . in order to try the right value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid ; try out .
to use a MIDI map , simply open the dialog for MIDI settings . this can be found in the menu under settings , point MIDI settings
the channel view is a window with a whole series of keyboard ( one for every MIDI channel ) . on these cl@@ avi@@ es you see which sounds are just played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel you can select a selection list , if you have changed a instrument , does not lights green but red to indicate that the original instrument is used .
the channel view has ( until now ) two different views to display the played tones . view in the menu Settings under the point Channel View : settings
the speed LCD displays the speed , which is played with a song . the higher the number , the higher the speed .
you can change the pace of a song . if you can find a song be too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the pace , use the arrows to the left and right from the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a music piece must be played . it contains notes , the rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; so the same MIDI file can lead to very different results as well as two different musicians can play the same notes on very different ways .
good , I may not be able to force &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while a mp3 @-@ file takes you like a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you can change the individual instruments , the speed &amp; etc ; they have control over everything .
that can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) of &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support was compiled . to eliminate the problem , you have to download and install a source distribution ( e.g. from k@@ mid ; &apos;s home )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I have no pleasure to add all files separately .
agree to support &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; choose all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ windows .
in advance , enable the setting of automatic adding to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can use the arrow key left from Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down playback . in order to restore the default temp@@ o , you can double click on the LCD .
I have on a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Desktop a &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window with my MIDI file and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I want to play a kar@@ aoke file ) or act on this desktop ( if I want to play a file ) , merely go into the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows and move the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ; go .
if you want to listen to a file quickly , without them to add to a collection , turn off the setting of automatic adding to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection .
let &apos;s suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ C. Zu@@ id you want to play only the first file . thus , set the setting of automatic adding to the collection and then open a temporary collection , then just this one MIDI file .
then connect to the B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid player and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people have sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you very much ! if I see these songs or the postcard , animated me , continue on &amp; k@@ mid ; to program .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; in the moment I am written for my hob@@ bies , but I try to have a little time to take me . as Hob@@ bies , I try to do MIDI files , music and phr@@ ases .
if you want to know where they can download MIDI / kar@@ aoke files if you want a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you simply want to make me happy , write to me an e @-@ mail : lar@@ g @ k@@ de.@@ org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es
you really do it really a huge anticip@@ ation , if you send me a postcard from your home or a MID@@ I@@ - / kar@@ aoke file from a local group . if you want to send a postcard from &amp; k@@ mid ; if you want to contact a MIDI file , you should get in touch with me as I may have the file already .

a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer because the sound quality is much depending on your sound@@ card . it &apos;s not the same whether you use a FM device or a AW@@ E card .
if you have no sound card , you have to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DEM@@ O _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it works as if you had a sound@@ card unless you can &apos;t listen to music .

the application window is made from so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . there is an information window with the playlist . and finally there is a information window that will be displayed only if information is recovered .
it is possible to check the preferred connections under the menu book@@ marks , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category Dau@@ gh@@ ty playlist .
of course , you can add groups to groups in order to get an additional hier@@ archy , copied out his group and all its sub @-@ groups to the current category and playback begins with the attached entry .
the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , television and thum@@ b playlist can also be modified by direct editing the XML configuration files . of course , the various files in the directory ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / can also be replaced by the application . simply click on a name of a category . simply click on a sub @-@ group . it will only display the XML content of this part .
after changing XML files , the menu must be selected with playlist players and selected either the Edit Mode menu or selected any other category .
all changes are lost when processing mode or any other group is selected without paying the playlist .
due to the ease of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player , some functions can only be switched through changing the XML configuration files ..
the animation of starting and editing can be de@@ activated by the editing of ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c and change of &#91; General option &#93; No in@@ tro = 0 above option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can be inserted easily .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / note .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format needs to be a supported XML file .
the animation at starting doesn &apos;t need to be short , it will automatically termin@@ ate by opening another source . this would be dis@@ rup@@ ting the application , the user can termin@@ ate the application a second time .
a simple example of an start @-@ animation can be a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; mol@@ ds ; &amp; lt ; Ap@@ proved ; / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &apos; / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f ; / w ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; In the directory testing / some examples of S@@ MIL that are supported by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ;
there is a rider for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ Player ; . here , the path of the player and the space @-@ size of the data center will be set out of the network and other things .
another tool for trou@@ bl@@ esho@@ oting is the Button &apos; console &apos; in the tool bar of k@@ m@@ player . here is the output of m@@ player .
there is no rider for this ren@@ dition in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; . everything must be configured by manual editing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; with the module sw@@ f@@ dec mo@@ vers .
&apos; Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; it can even be inserted a special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
with that the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; can play in HTML pages , must be the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; module as a service provider for the M@@ ime type application / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the setting of file orders of K@@ DE .
the Con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is in a console application to start and search the error messages concerning the loading of the browser library . if there is no error , the back@@ end edition is within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console or console from the context menu ) .
this is always a pre@@ valent back@@ end for a specific M@@ ime type ( of course only if this has been determined ) , this should be done by manual changing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example , phon@@ on all og@@ g files are used :
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can play TV cards , either by using M@@ Player or X@@ video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be configured to utility device and TV channels . this can be edited manually from the configuration dialog , or the configuration file can be edited manually .
for configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( video data Rek@@ order ) settings in the k@@ m@@ player is the dialog to use in the settings below - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ video port . there , you should have to be found out of which one is selected . the correct name has to be found ( e.g. it is PAL for west Europe ) , the correct name has probably included a DVB in it .
since the V@@ DR support of k@@ m@@ player can only work X@@ Video ( probably this kind of play@@ off of video equipment under Linux can also work out . this is also only available on the first screen ( : 0.0 ) . this is why the video is functioning properly for the X server ( / etc / X11 / XF@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) this reason .
internally they are used by KM@@ players for the sources different names . at the time of the origin of this documentation this is d@@ v@@ d@@ n@@ av@@ source , t@@ v@@ d@@ source , t@@ v@@ source , t@@ v@@ source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ resource . if they are activated , they start playing the playlist .
are there any not@@ ices as I can make my CD@@ ROM drive when I play from it ( not by v@@ cd : / / ) ?
yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ e 8 / dev / c@@ drom is root as a user root after the inclusion of the device . it is absolutely secure to make that / dev / c@@ drom indicates the CD@@ ROM drive .
X@@ ine starts slowly , why do I have to checked my CPU on your performance every time ?

most of these components may be included in the used &amp; Linux ; -@@ Distribution included . for installation , documentation of the distribution or installation disc should be attracted ; / DVD .
the &amp; cop@@ ile ; project contains some already compiled packages of &amp; c@@ ile ; for different distri@@ butions . these enable a simple installation without further comp@@ iling and are contained on the c@@ ile ; -@@ web@@ page .
this manual is available for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ ile ; , &amp; &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users do not need to read this manual . however , all proposals for the documentation is taken into account . is the support for this project or its documentation , the contact should be made via the k@@ ile ; -@@ web site .

as well as other drawing languages includes &amp; lat@@ ex ; an introduction , with which the gener@@ alized properties such as paper format , side number@@ ing and text surface will be specified as well as to the text \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class , the command begins with the command \ \ config in { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ end { document } .
the quick @-@ level assistant of &amp; k@@ ile ; is an important function for the quick preparation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; the selection of the assistant ( Men@@ Ã ¼ ) offers some potential for the creation of the document . it can also be made some on the document related settings .
document classes : hereby announces the type of a document document : articles ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , report &#91; report &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book &#91; Be@@ amer &#93; , slides &#91; prosp@@ er &#93; or custom .
encoding : this is used to use the encoding of the system . modern systems use the UTF @-@ 8 encoding than standard . at best , UTF @-@ 8x should be used ( for correct processing of &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ documents ) .
this list includes the most often used supplem@@ entary packages for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the integration they are only with only in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) . you should always be used with the creation of German texts .
new users now don &apos;t worry about it . merely a short description of functions and further information will be given in the section .
&amp; c@@ ile ; offers - just like other source code editors - the high@@ lighting of the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the incorrect one ) . by &amp; ile , it is not possible to make any mathematical environment . however , it is possible through the modest appearance of the output file . however , it will be saved by the emphasis time and conditions .
with automatic understanding of the environments , for example \ \ Beg@@ in { command } ) of &amp; c@@ ile ; automatically creates a space line ( for example \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be activated in the menu settings ( e.g. \ \ ) ; this function can be de@@ activated in menu settings ; La@@ Te@@ X commands are disabled .
all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; Lat@@ ex ; the sub@@ division of the document must be saved in the following elements ( part is the most beautiful and sub@@ set the lowest element ) :
when the document has a document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed through a mouse click on the particular area .
when creating the own &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ files can be very helpful with the creation of your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; as soon as a DVI ; file &#91; smo@@ ked file &#93; created , jumps &amp; c@@ ile ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in DVI ; -@@ viewer on the appropriate line in &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as the font art of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; there are many tools for the view , conversion and to print DVI ; -@@ files for different systems and categories .
when using the serial interface , the elements of the DVI ; -@@ file is clicked on a element in the DVI ; -@@ file spra@@ yed . the previous opposite is the exact opposite . once on a section in &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is clicked on the corresponding site in DVI ; -@@ viewer calls .
Master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document the work is simplified using other inserts .@@ tex files . when using a project , a project can be set up a project project concerning Project Properties project .
quick construction : the &amp; Lat@@ ex ; the source code is compiled and the result will automatically be displayed ( if no error in the source code ) .
file recovery : in this mode , the DVI ; -@@ file is located in the di@@ der@@ line level . if needed , and it does not take a call from &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after quick construction .
for consideration of the editing tool bar the three rough @-@ divisions should be developed . the selection areas have been developed for fast integration of the document into parts , chapters , sections , ... Die ver@@ itable &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands for the sub@@ division are :
the selection field is further important for products such as tags , joints , notes , or references .
name : this command is generated by a section for a section , a picture or different element .
reference : is used for reference to a specified designation ( selection of a selection of selection ) .
when using quot@@ ation , a selection list is displayed with literary entries . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; this only works if the file has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ tex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; -@@ files can also be written in &amp; c@@ ile ; by hand .
the last selection field with the name Gra@@ Ã ¶ Ã ¶ e is used for the definition of the font . it can be specified for the main text , the Fu@@ Ã © notes etc . it is the following font divisions .
when calling &amp; k@@ ile ; two choices are available for completion : 1 . the assistant is for creating a new document by selecting the document art and determination of settings . 2 . the document can be written by reason to hand .
the brackets according to the command \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class contain the settings for the command . setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; specifies the font set . the font is not specified at the beginning , this can also be done in the text .
as soon as the above source code , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code needs to be compiled . the easiest way for this is the use of the building or of the button .
the source code must be stored before the compilation . &amp; c@@ ile ; for storing the storage automatically begins .
conclusion of the document command , should be searched in the protocol according to the errors . when using quick construction , &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; it is not the case however , the log message should also be considered .
an area ( English environment ) is a text that is treated differently than the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font size will be created and only a few trees are supposed to have a different font . the command \ \ Beg@@ in { the command of the font set within the surrounding area should be made in the surrounding area ( English ) .
the properties are only necessary within the environment ( from \ \ \ in { environment } to \ \ at { environment } ) . there is no labelling ( number ) available in the surrounding area within the environment .
there are many mosqu@@ it@@ oes to recover the read@@ ability and user @-@ friendliness of the document . for example , certain fonts , grease , cur@@ sive , sub@@ missions , etc . these commands are either using the command \ \ or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ Beg@@ in { em@@ ph } : this command is for the cur@@ sive pressure and is long as long until it is closed with \ \ \ { em@@ ph } or another surrounding area . a single word in one proposition can be represented with \ \ em@@ ph { word } .
\ \ Qu@@ ote : creates a quote in the document . the quot@@ ation starts with \ \ Beg@@ in { Qu@@ ote } and ends with \ \ at { Qu@@ ote } .
after the background , after writing the source text by &amp; Lat@@ ex ; a step @-@ by @-@ step guide will now follow , follows a step @-@ by @-@ step guide to create a document in &amp; c@@ ile ; .
as soon as the assistant was entered a bit of text , a few adjustments for the better read@@ ability of the document should be fulfilled . these should be min@@ d@@ ently a quote , a few places in the fat and spa pressure , and a po@@ em to the application to see the differences of these commands .
as soon as the document has been viewed , can be returned to the editor using Editor @-@ View or Str@@ g E ( in the internal viewer ) . in an external viewer , the window must be closed .
as soon as the DVI ; -@@ file has been created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . try to test and fun .
DVI ; is an independent file format ( English . D e V ice I n@@ ée ) . these files will be created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for le@@ gi@@ bility of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi output such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF - converting or computer screens .
for printing a &amp; DVI ; file the same steps as for the creation of the document ( see ) . in the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , then the document can be printed ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the tool bar is the conversion of DVI ; file into other formats . once the DVI ; file from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code has been created , the conversion can start into several different formats using the buttons in the tool bar .
the anticip@@ ation @-@ looking for the direct jump from the editor to add @-@ in position within the DVI ; -@@ File .
&amp; c@@ ile ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Bin@@ ding files . for this purpose , only modern settings are used under Settings ... tools can be built .
to prepare for the previous search , the mouse has to be positioned in a line of source tex@@ tured and close to previous search . the jump to the corresponding place in the DVI ; -@@ viewer is then done so .
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; is used with a click of the medium mouse button in DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ document of &amp; c@@ ile ; shown and related to the appropriate line . for this purpose , &amp; c@@ ile ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ( Settings ... Editor )
if using quick @-@ making of &amp; DVI ; viewer can &apos;t work an error , this should be an error in the log file or displayed in the message window .
the protocol file exceeds the error source in the source code . in the editor , the protocol of La@@ Te@@ X @-@ Error and N@@ Ã ¤ ster La@@ Te@@ X will always be the line where the error appears to be clicked on the error in the protocol , jumps to the incorrect line .
once upon the appropriate button in the tool bar , a window appears to choose from the relevant template for the document . the pre @-@ set costs are :
when selecting le@@ eres document , a document may either be written either from the ground or the assistant to fast creating a new document . further information is included in the section .
H@@ Ã ¤ u@@ tier users of &amp; Lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction to virtually all documents . templates are created , stored and loaded to make the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , it must be created either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file s@@ ows or create a new file . &amp; c@@ ile ; can create a new template using existing document and selection of file template .
when creating a new document , a new document must be replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set in settings and configure settings .
when creating your own template it is therefore necessary to know what character strings of which variables are replaced :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ M@@ ENT@@ CLASS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ : this string is replaced by the input in documentation class . typically , it will be following : \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ M@@ ENT@@ CLASS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ &#93; { article } .
the easiest way to create a template is the use of the Assistant and the associated entry into the editor . once the document has been created , m@@ Ã ¼ s@@ sen has finished the following steps :
when creating a new document , it can then be the own template instead of the standard .
a template may be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ files will be created . a simple way to create a template should be searched for one in the Internet and want to be crossed under described steps below .
&amp; Kate ; used &amp; Kate ; as an internal editor . &amp; Kate ; is a text editor for programm@@ ability of reading and high@@ ness of many different kinds of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for &amp; Kate ; can be carried out directly in the menu .
to learn more about &amp; Kate ; and to learn his recovery , the hand@@ book should be attracted to Kate . users of &amp; c@@ ile work should start directly with the reading of the chapter by &amp; Kate .
&amp; c@@ ile ; offers a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command reference , which can be called the Men@@ Ã ¼ Help La@@ Te@@ X Reference . it contains a detailed description of almost all commands that can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; use as well as their syntax .
double @-@ click &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button to choose the &amp; tex ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that by clicking on \ \ par by \ \ par \ \ big@@ ski@@ p for \ \ par \ \ big@@ ski@@ p for \ \ par \ \ big@@ ski@@ p \ \ \ par \ \ big@@ ski@@ p .
when drawing the text with the left @-@ left mouse button , the selected text will automatically be copied to the cli@@ p@@ board .
when using the arrow buttons with an additional switch box , parts of the source code in the Edit@@ orial window will be balanced .
&amp; c@@ ile ; has the ability to browse the most diverse types of source tex@@ tured and these . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands from normal text and also the mathematical formul@@ as are highlighted by another color .
many assist@@ ants may be possible . this is an own type of book@@ marks within the text . the men@@ tions are highlighted the jump to the next or last j@@ umping brand . this trampoline is highlighted automatically , so that it will automatically be del@@ etes to the first input of a character .
the editing is probably one of the key effects when using a program such as &amp; k@@ ile ; . although &amp; Kate . already excellent functions have been added to &amp; lat@@ ex ; important functions for their selection . &amp; Lat@@ ex ; se@@ duc@@ ts many environments and groups . special commands for their selection . under handling , the following commands are included in the text selection :
there is a complete sub@@ section ( group of lines , which included on both sides a blank line ) . this extended meaning is not a text including tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands and all other lines of the source of source . the only significant thing in &amp; c@@ ile ; is thus the fact that the fact is separated by two empty lines .
the word below the current cur@@ sor position . this selection has also an extended meaning as this command also &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands with a storage size ( \ \ ) and an average star ( * ) at the end .
to make a part of the document the document can be removed from the first . &amp; Kate ; offers the scanning box C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the entire line is removed . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers with your own commands . under handling , the following commands are contained to the text of the text :
remov@@ es a complete sub@@ section . the definition for a sub@@ section in &amp; c@@ ile ; is contained in the description of processing items .
it has already been clear that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore , &amp; c@@ ile ; for further orders under working environment for a m@@ Ã ¶ ous work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
with this command , spec@@ ulations will be spra@@ yed at the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the command .
with this command , jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to close the environment .
if the cur@@ sor is found before or within the command \ \ Beg@@ in { vicinity } , the end of the environment is spra@@ yed ( or vice vers@@ a ) .
when entering many w@@ ax@@ ed ambient commands can quickly lost the sea view . this command completes the most recent environment , so that the cast@@ ed environment structure is not tender .
&amp; c@@ ile ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups that are determined by brackets { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X @-@ Group are some important commands that correspond to the working environment .
this command will be spra@@ yed at the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the cl@@ ing cl@@ amps .
this command will be spra@@ yed at the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the cl@@ amps .
if the cur@@ sor is before or behind the left cl@@ amps of a &amp; tex ; group # is , the other end of the group convers@@ ations ( or vice vers@@ a ) .
in the input of many w@@ ax@@ ed groups @-@ cl@@ amps it can be quickly made possible . this command completes the most recent group , so that the cast@@ ed structure of the &amp; tex ; groups does not reach .
in &amp; Lat@@ ex ; two easy beginnings as G@@ Ã ¤ se@@ se@@ venti@@ onal sign is used in &amp; c@@ ile ; the sign &apos; for two easy beginnings is used . &amp; c@@ ile ; knows this case , and for two levels for opening signs for &amp; lat@@ ex ; one .
this automatic insert for the double start @-@ up sign can be setup under Settings ... La@@ Te@@ X and switch off .
there are also no specific settings ( e.g. n@@ ée or French ) and therefore German or French beginnings . there are also many other languages available .
during the drums of Shift ; Inclu@@ de for type of Shift . if the current position is located within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , if the current position is located within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , not only one line break but at the same time the command \ \ item .
inside a table @-@ setting , the current line with \ \ \ \ with a close @-@ end sl@@ ump .
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to highlight pre @-@ installed &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or custom environments . these can be added to Settings ... La@@ Te@@ X will be attached .
some users are possible to arrange the columns of tables in tables , and all the E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) with each other tab . although this tab@@ ulator is not the one in the above line . although this tab@@ ulator is not the da@@ zz@@ ling table . although this tab@@ ulator is not the da@@ zz@@ ling table , for some inter@@ space for the columns of the current tab@@ ul@@ ators .
although &amp; Kate ; already it has a good source code , it has been installed in &amp; c@@ ile ; for special commands ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) , these modes are installed for automatic processing . all these modes can be adjusted for different working modes of settings ... custom@@ iz@@ able .
at the beginning a new environment using the command \ \ Beg@@ in { surrounding } is &amp; c@@ ile ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
when pressing the R@@ Ã ¼ ck@@ button the last letter of the input will be removed and fully automatically the promise . on the other hand , the list may also be reduced by entering a further letters .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions will be frozen for selecting a command . alternatively , this jump jump to these positions by using j@@ umping j@@ umping nets of the current j@@ umping brand is possible and the resulting parameters will be m@@ illed then .
under Settings ... En@@ ter the settings of these lists can be made . there are several different lists for lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ command as well as knowledge of the general language used to be used .
the command mode is not suited for the distribution of environments . it is always a few letters with \ \ Beg@@ in entered and the call of the fully operational mode will be used . on the other hand , environments are used so often that &amp; c@@ ile ; a special mode for fully util@@ isation of environments .
when calling the message mode , the command will automatically be attached to the surrounding area or the button Alt + Shift button , the command will be automatically maintained and it appears \ \ Beg@@ in . after this , the ambient temperature can be continued and by pressing the input button to be finished .
once this has been completed , the environment will be closed automatically again . once &amp; k@@ ile ; recogni@@ zes that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command can be included .
under Settings ... En@@ ile Settings ... Do not adjust the settings to these lists . this mode uses the knowledge list of default mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Comm@@ ands .
&amp; c@@ ile ; supported user @-@ defined lists of wast@@ es which can be replaced with l@@ act@@ less strings . the lists can be used exc@@ essi@@ vely using settings .. as an example of the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which example the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , the letter L is entered and the word fully @-@ compliant mode will be re@@ directed to the letter or the key r@@ zel Str@@ g + Alt Le@@ ert@@ aste , the letter L will be replaced by the character \ \ La@@ Te@@ X character string .
rough branches are not helpful for automatic refurb@@ ishment . however , it has been found that many W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter can be written in a document more than once . there@@ with , &amp; c@@ ile ; the fully operational character is already written .
this mode can be used in the menu Settings ... K@@ ile Ver@@ tical settings can be turned off . here you can also adjust the threshold value for the display of the tolerance .
the fully @-@ sharing files can be installed in the sub @-@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / / / mode / the Persian home folder . mode is available for de@@ cel@@ eration ( reduction ) , Dictionary ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ .-@@ ) or tex .
the dialog graphics can also be designed for graphics as easy as possible . in order to view the basics of the graphics formats , sections and opinions should be considered .
PS @-@ files are not as known as PDF files , but offer an excellent basis for changes and new orders from pages . will the PDF output is added to the pages with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; -@@ tools newly ordered and then converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file .
in order to understand the result of the work , you need to comp@@ ile the source code . all construction tools are group@@ ed into the Men@@ Ã ¼ s create comp@@ iling , creating converting and Create view .
for the comp@@ iling of the source code for viewer like &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the other transformation can be used by Alt ; 3 , using Alt ; 4 , using Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file to a PS file and be viewed using Alt ; 5 the PS file .
when using the command box , usually a viewer is called after the compilation . if no embedded viewer is used , any new window will be opened .
a new project will be asked for the project New Project .... We will be asked for the following information for the project :
when selecting the file name window , the relative path is specified by the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file .
the script function of &amp; k@@ ile ; allows the scanning of EC@@ MAS@@ M @-@ Ko@@ de . scripts can be managed by scripts in the vertical axis .
the API scripts are not yet fully developed and can be seen in further versions of &amp; c@@ ile ; yet .
as the first we have to be said that the development environment of scripts in &amp; c@@ ile ; a systematic object ( = k@@ ile ) has the following methods :
&amp; Lat@@ ex ; is a fairly detailed system in which the basic functions can be expanded by a multitude of other packages . &amp; c@@ ile ; offers a lot of different help to ensure the user .

a fully @-@ fully re@@ mot@@ ely re@@ mot@@ ely for &amp; tex ; and his e@@ â s . that is not only for a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but rather it is ideal for search of a certain form@@ att@@ ing . since it is a very large @-@ called document , it is divided into &amp; c@@ ile ; divided into three important book@@ marks .
due to the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / Tex@@ live ; is the fin@@ den of the right document is not always easy . as m@@ Ã ¶ mer@@ sible help offers &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , which contains a database with all documents .

the version 3.2 of &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; includes many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration into &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; all of these tools are used as surface and lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ 2 . the combination makes fast , efficient , full and productive tools .
everyone who worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ documentation has been working properly , knows what it is still a piece , we give it a graphical surface ! not to be printed on a terminal , simply lock the symbol for the XML processor and finished !
this application is an inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is located in the used folder , then you can remove the current folder folder . if not , then remove the selection of current folder and enter it in the field of other folders .
output files will be stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files are deleted every time when the pro@@ c is started .
as already said that everyone at the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation has already worked , white , how helpful this application is . and with &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us , there is now a great graphical surface for it .
if the installed file inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is , then they just leave the current folder folder . if not , then select the current folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is to be found .
if it comes to a edition on the screen , your file is broken . please check the reported errors and try it again .
if the file is already marked in &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; then you can simply break the current file simply . if not , delete it to current file the hem@@ at@@ ches and select the file to transfer file using other file - file selection .
if they only want to know if the file is well @-@ structured , then click the Well @-@ module review selection .
to use a &amp; D@@ TD ; used in the &amp; XML ; ( internal ) , otherwise &amp; D@@ TD ; ( External ) , otherwise &amp; D@@ TD ; ( External ) , otherwise &amp; D@@ TD ; schem@@ atic for both &amp; W@@ 3C ; &amp; XML ; schem@@ atic as well as for the Rel@@ ax@@ NG review is the indication of the definition UR@@ I ; in the file selection is required .
Ja@@ well , &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this is using the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library .
should the inv@@ iting file in &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; already marked , then you can simply select the current file . if not , remove the current file and select the file directly using the other file file selection .
specify the name of the file as the result is named , and the file is usually stored in its native file .
the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; even may have little to do . this makes the plug@@ in system very powerful . you can &apos;t wait from the additional functionality and must not wait until someone can use the desired in &amp; quantitative ; the plug @-@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; the elements can also be used below .
to install a plug@@ in or a K@@ Part we begin to work with the menu plug @-@ ins and the following dialog will be opened :
this dialog allows to manage all plug@@ ins and add new plug@@ ins . we describe each &amp; GUI ; -@@ element in it :
here you can enter the search ad . using plug @-@ ins without a storage location &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; this path for searching for the search of the plug @-@ ins .
often on a project several people work in a kind of hier@@ arch@@ ical relationship . &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; supports the indication of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project characteristics .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . Nick@@ name is the top name of the user and serves to clear identification .
one member can have several roles in the project , such as both team leader and sub@@ project leaders .
the user can choose from the list of te@@ amm@@ ates , who is it . this happens by taking the team member from the list and push the button S@@ etze . the currently selected member ( their identification ) will be f@@ ett after you are : text .
sur@@ name and attitude of own identity are important concerning messages and comments . see for further information about ann@@ ot@@ ations .
besides the overview of their team , there is another advantage through the acquisition of the teams : it may be created an event on the team leader if something is happening within . see for further information .
event actions are actions which can be executed if something is happening within the project . an example would be how much someone is backed up , or the sending of a message if a file is secured , or a script that plays a file into CV@@ S as soon as they will be added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the page event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project project settings dialog boxes may be created , processed and deleted .
an email will be sent to the address data selected in the receiver list . address can be a team @-@ or sub@@ project leader . see , we@@ i such ladder set up .
notes are special comments in documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
note : it can be simply inserted either a note from the editor @-@ text menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation key@@ word in a comment area followed by an@@ tigen text .
note that a particular member of the team will be sent . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , the top name of the team leader , sub @-@ project leader after enrich@@ ing and sub@@ project guides should be given as defined in the examples below .
nick@@ names and cast@@ ors names are independent of large or small cut@@ outs , but spaces around the cl@@ amps and the : make the note inv@@ alid .
&amp; Ex@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a development environment for scripts and form@@ att@@ ing languages supported by D@@ TD @-@ ag@@ nost@@ ic and script languages .
the settings can be reached via the settings . here only via &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for those can be found in .
the settings can be viewed by settings Quant@@ a ... may be called by a few pages that will be treated succ@@ essi@@ vely .
the behaviour of &amp; quantitative details ; regarding tags , including car completion , the entries can be changed .
large / small sc@@ roll@@ ment of tags : large / small sc@@ roll@@ ment of automatic tags : normal sized / small j@@ ections means , the tags will be inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
large / small sc@@ roll@@ ment of At@@ tri@@ bu@@ cks : large / small cut@@ outs from automatically introduced attri@@ bute . normal Groß / small j@@ ections means the attributes are added as described in the tag@@ XML files .
optional Tags automatically include : if necessary , it is optional for tags , for which the closing day is optional , this is immediately inserted after the &amp; gt ; inserted .
not optional tags automatically : as above for all other tags with the exception of the simple tags .
start and closing date automatically update : if enabled , the corresponding closing day will be changed and vice vers@@ a .
automatic replacement of acc@@ ent sign : controls the automatic transformation of ac@@ claimed characters in the corresponding coding during in@@ ti@@ pp@@ ies .
M@@ ime types : m@@ im@@ et@@ yp@@ es for detection of different types of files . using button standard , the standard pre @-@ set files can be restored .
standard Dra@@ coding : the encoding of newly created or in other way as with file opening open files ( where the encoding of the file can be negoti@@ ated ) , but this setting is being displayed by the same in the project characteristics , if a project is loaded .
standard D@@ TD : the selected D@@ TD is used for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ TD is not recognized . but this setting is being displayed by the same in the project characteristics , if a project is loaded .
create a backup copy : &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; created regularly backup copies so that when a current failure or crash can be recovered from this backup file , this is not the same as saving the file . this is not the same as saving the file . however , it is not used for backup regularly , according to the set time .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editorial field or one own view ( or the documentation in a cart@@ ei@@ re@@ iter ) which makes it possible to preview the documentation , preview and source code simultaneously .
set the window settings on the standard back to the next start is useful if the user interface has come through changing the MDI modes and and@@ o@@ cken / depend on views each other . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameters .
the warning messages range is the tax of the possibility to dis@@ able the indication of war@@ nings by An@@ h@@ ack of no more questions .
the place to change the behaviour of &amp; V@@ PL ; can change the display of symbols instead of scripts , as well as the synchron@@ isation of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source code in divided mode . regarding the different modes see .
here is the par@@ ser and the structural tree that shows the picture of the par@@ ser @-@ no@@ des into the document , in details .
in the area of mouse click on the structural tree , the following action is possible to change the structure of the structure with the mouse &apos;s mouse .
in the field of structural change settings , the visibility of no@@ des in tree , can be set automatically as deep with a change of the structural tree . empty no@@ des are the empty areas in the text , whereas empty groups are that there are no element found in the current document .
the area for stays of ab@@ brevi@@ ations ( a type of templates ) that can be un@@ folded when working on large text . ab@@ brevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can enter a valid group of PHP , in which the i@@ f@@ cl@@ ause ab@@ brevi@@ ation is slightly different than in a group valid for Javascript .
the plug @-@ ins can be managed here . plug @-@ ins are K@@ Part @-@ Applications from the third side , which can be re @-@ used by any K@@ Part @-@ capable application , at the most famous &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; . with insertion of a plug @-@ ins must be given the following :
address : the path to the plug@@ in if it is not at a standard like $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / lib .
input : this information is handed over to the plug@@ in to the start , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folders ( path of current file ) or the project folder .
component in &quot; Only @-@ L@@ ese &quot; mode : check if the plug@@ in does not accept the store . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ parts usually refuse to load when this option is not chosen .
check the plug@@ in : this is activated , then test@@ is &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; if the selected information is correct . then , if the plug@@ in is not available at the moment , if the plug@@ in is not available at the moment , but it will be installed later .
for &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; starting from version 3.3 , the trou@@ bl@@ esho@@ oting has been completely developed . dial support for the D@@ BG Deb@@ ug@@ ger . instead , the support for the D@@ BG Deb@@ ug@@ ger . instead of which a deb@@ ug@@ ger plug@@ in concept was implemented , which allows various implem@@ entations via plug @-@ ins .
currently only a plug@@ in is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; in@@ quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; inserted .
use of the deb@@ ug@@ gers for a project starts with the selection of a suitable Deb@@ ug@@ ger plug @-@ ins in the project settings . using the Options options , next to the de@@ bug plug@@ in selection field , the specific settings can be changed .
if a deb@@ ug@@ ger enabled a deb@@ ug@@ ger , some additional elements appear at the &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; user interface :
a view that is displayed in the contents of monitored variables . normally you will be in the left Dock .
a view , where all hold points , with line numbers and conditions are listed below . usually in the bottom dock .
a view in which the edition ( as shown in HTML ) of the deb@@ ug@@ gers will be displayed in the bottom dock .
depending on the supported features of the monitor , everything is available or part of the following functionality .
using this action , the connection to Deb@@ ug@@ ger , if necessary , or they share the plug@@ in to listen to de@@ bug . this promotion is opened by default if a project is opened , which must not be counted in normal case .
the equivalent session on the deb@@ ug@@ ging session starts the session . closes the connection to Deb@@ ug@@ ger or end the listen to requirements .
transm@@ its a HTTP requirement to the server using a de@@ bug request . this is equivalent to the use of a browser to view the current document . the issue of this requirement is displayed in the Deb@@ ug@@ ger issue .
indicates the deb@@ ug@@ ger to start and send information about the super@@ vised variables and the currently completed line . if this happens while the script is done , the execution is done before a deb@@ ug@@ an@@ ion started , the script will start with the requirement .
indicates the de@@ bug to begin with the execution of the script , without information on super@@ vised variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script has been given , the execution begins as soon as a request has been placed .
the deb@@ ug@@ ger performs the next statement in the script without entering into the functions or include .
deb@@ ug@@ ger performs the next statement in the script , whereby if possible in functions and include requirements .
shows the deb@@ ug@@ ger to transfer the instruction and go to the next such as if there are not the current .
opens a dialog where a variable or expression can be entered , which should be monitored . the super@@ vised value appears in the variable view .
with this dialogue a variable is entered or a new value of a variable can be set .

this chapter describes how to adjust &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; to adapt to your needs , and how to help and be able to become better .
documentation of editing packages ( D@@ T@@ EP ; s ) are used in &amp; quantitative ( D@@ T@@ EP ; ) to give support for mark@@ up@@ - and script languages as well as CSS . your simplicity and flexibility are made from &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for Web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; there are two types , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages or &amp; CSS ; and day file contain two file types , the text file and tool@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and day XML files are handy , symbo@@ lically @-@ oriented suffering from image buttons ( above the editing window ) , the text and instructions can add faster into a document as a user may ever .
&amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; s can be delivered correctly ( see below ) , download or automatically created using an existing D@@ TD . see for details about conversion .
this document describes how to create Tag@@ XML files , then the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . short , one &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and the contents of the u@@ res@@ sources , the &amp; quantitative pl@@ et@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; tool bars allow a fast insert of tags in a document without risk of a writing .
tag file are nothing as folder . you contain only the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the day XML files . day folder carry the name of the language and version , so there . ( for example , html @-@ 4.0@@ 1 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML , and declare if they are necessary , or not . although not all necessary , it is advis@@ able to use as many as possible , so many users have a better viewing and more information on the work with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail : everything about the possibilities and the limits are explained in simple way .
this is the root element of an Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it may contain the definition of many tags if there is only one element type over itself .
the tags is a script function . when used is &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the conference room class . the name of the basic class for this class . ( family 2 )
only valid for the type Method . specifies the name of the class where this method is one . ( family 2 )
if yes , the day has an common At@@ tri@@ but@@ t group and the attributes within this tags can be added to any other day . ( family 1 )
set a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; -@@ day . that &apos;s an only element type item .
described a attri@@ bute of a tags . this element can only be found for each attri@@ bute . additionally , it sets the name and type of attri@@ bute . additionally , there is another tags that will describe how this attri@@ bute is to be displayed &amp; etc ; This is an only element type item .
to fill the source code for the attributes in day Edit@@ orial dialog and the At@@ tri@@ butes tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; is used to reach the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; is used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , an interface and a method@@ ology name . the arguments that can be committed to the method . can be empty or aver@@ aged 29 % , meaning the name of the current tags .
a container day formed the elements of a list . it can only occur once a attri@@ bute description . it is an only element type element .
put the position of attri@@ bute tex@@ tured in a dialog box . this day can only occur for any attri@@ bute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; -@@ day ) . the element is empty .
returns the position and size of a field in dialogue . this day should be present for every field in dialogue once ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this element is empty .
there is a list of elements that may occur within the defined tags . this element is an only element type .
there is a list of elements that have one day . this element is an only element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must begin with one &amp; XML ; Declaration begin : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be mo@@ cked and closed .
spaces do not influence anything , but pay attention on &amp; and &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; wh@@ o@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; will be replaced , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the tag@@ XML files the tools dialog box is in the &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Window to start and check out Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ A . another dialog will appear to follow its simple instructions .
this function is currently not available yet . currently , the verification takes place only when charging the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us .
in the following example , for a family of 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; sch@@ ema &gt; -@@ element from the &amp; W@@ 3C ; &amp; XML ; sch@@ ema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ atic day .
in the following an example of a functional family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP file is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this tag file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UTF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; day name = &quot; over@@ load type = &quot; function &quot; re@@ load type = &quot; function &quot; &gt; &amp; lt ; att@@ est name = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; tags &gt;
the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is also fairly simple , and there is an editor that can be processed via D@@ TD edit via D@@ TD ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; should be created for a newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; should a simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries will be created :
&#91; General &#93; version = using 1 for &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = D@@ TD . ( - / / W@@ 3C ; / / D@@ TD HTML 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional ) . if not specified , the name is used as a Nick@@ name .
a action can be set up with settings ... Click on New action to the same dialog :
this promotion is assigned to the scanning box . with clicking the user interface , a button bar can be assigned . with K@@ one is the current key@@ bo@@ ar removal .
the sim@@ pl@@ est actions . the text can be entered in detail in detail and inserted in the document at the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . using this promotion you can use external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that use the document or used as input ( or parts of the document ) , are the quick start -@@ dialog or the different Lo in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ EP@@ s .
the first must be the name of the script and interpre@@ ter . example : SH / home / my@@ home / my@@ scri@@ pt@@ .@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % skri@@ pt@@ est variable in command line : global script file : $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps / quantity / quantity / quantity / quantity / quantity / quantity / quantity in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in the command line :
% f : we will be replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file : / from the document name .
% pi@@ d : is replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; process replacement . if by &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; only one instance is running , the text will be checked to the P@@ ID number . this is useful if D@@ COP is used on the control of &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; the external script will be used .
the parameter for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or the path to the project file .
in addition to the above included methods , a script can be selected by &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; in the input field input can be determined , which can be sent to default . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected section of the document is sent to the script . the % input is usually only meaning@@ ful with this setting .
according to the input , the output of the issued application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types of output : normal edition , written on the standard error edition , which should be specified on the default output issue , by using the value the selection dialog box :
if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups . it is necessary to create a tool bar for each group . in the given case it is not too many , therefore one can create a tool bar with the name of the brand @-@ ups .
once a tool bar is added , you need to add actions and configure your settings . choose the settings .
the parts of this window are pretty self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the new action button@@ hole at the bottom end of the window starts to work @-@ mode mode .
fill out all the necessary fields and add them the day to the matching tool bar .
complete all and if the day attributes and you plan to plan , activate the dialog &quot; Tag , &quot; when available , therefore a input is possible when using the action .
Ig@@ itt ! is that a bad symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? if we replace it before we have trouble .
to create a symbol that the action is better represented , we &apos;ll use &amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; choose from the &amp; menu ; , graphics other programs ( or where else it is located in its distribution ) .
&amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size .
please note that this symbol does not only helps you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; .
with regard that the day start , I decided to create a starting button as a symbol . by using green ( green becomes usually interpreted , or should at least , a message to the user ) , or should click on this symbol no &amp; lt ; start@@ up ; -@@ day in current document .
after creating the symbol no need to be connected with the action . this is done by the menu with settings ... ( in &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; ) and selection of the required action . next to the text box is a button , press it .
select the folder where the stored icon is , choose it and confirm with OK .
press the user button and continue with other tags , so it still gives , or confirm to complete with OK .
assum@@ ing you want some usual &amp; parall@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; functions to the tool bar supplement , or it should be shared to a better overview by some Tren@@ to in several groups . open the tool bar settings dialog for Settings tool bars . make sure the tool@@ bar will be selected .
I would like to choose the tr@@ amp ( on the left above ) for my tool bar . after selecting the element to be added to the tool bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the tool bar .
for example , I want to preview a quick way to access the Con@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add the tool bar .
please note as the separ@@ ator does not support the group@@ ing . someone who does not know my tool bar could believe that the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Button is the opposite of the Start Button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by test all symbols to ensure that everything works .
secure in the right folder . after re@@ e@@ XML does not exist , but your tool bar ( s ) should be stored in the right folder . please adjust your &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; so that your tool bar will be loaded ( s ) if a file is opened from the appropriate type .
perhaps the most important extension of &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the script language or shap@@ ing language that you like a &amp; PHP ; document tree for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation , you could check the &amp; quantitative repository , if anyone has already done for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you have to search for a existing documentation for the form@@ att@@ ing / script / etc ; -@@ language . then you need to create the doc@@ r@@ c file . the first part we have to handle the second .
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = path , relative to this file , e.g. php@@ 42 / # elements in the main index Top Element = your description for these docum@@ ent@@ aries e.g. &amp; PHP , # Sec@@ 2.3 Sec@@ 1 = Sec@@ 1 html 1.0@@ 2 = No 2.@@ html tag@@ 1 = tag@@ 2@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2@@ html 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html
the section tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , see the &amp; PHP documentation here :
# K@@ DE config File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = php@@ 42 / # top level Elements Top Element = PHP 4.2 , Calcul@@ ated = Table of Cont@@ ents = inde@@ x@@ .@@ html Get@@ ting Start@@ ed = introduction , ... introduction = Manufac@@ tion@@ .@@ html ... Language Reference = Sp@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ taxes .@@ html ...
note the # before Get@@ ting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this shows that it is a sub @-@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the chess cor@@ rid@@ ors ( except the Re@@ ason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it out .
note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly onto a file ( and consistent at the upper end of the building view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder will be displayed ! ) .
spaces do not influence anything , but make sure to &amp; &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; Res@@ our@@ c@@ end@@ at@@ ts will be replaced .
the depth section is the range of doc@@ r@@ c file which is to be displayed to the coating of a tex@@ tured _ Fet@@ ch _ array function . by marking the function called and pressing C@@ tr@@ l ; H for context aid would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the Con@@ text List ( Con@@ text@@ List ) and the File Conne@@ ctions .
a simple list of different context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file doc@@ r@@ c / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / quantity / quantity / quantity / quantity / quantity / quantity / quantity / quantity / quantity for local and global use . then create a folder ( such as you specified this in your file doc@@ r@@ c ) in the same folder as doc@@ r@@ c , and copy your HTML documentation .
if you &apos;re sure these good and it &apos;s worth , please send your doc@@ r@@ c files with a description of important information , such as documentation is used to the &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ community . you will not be rich , but we will be proud to have worked with the best web development platform .
with &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the separ@@ ator of resources ( D@@ T@@ EP pack@@ ets , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) , and there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or else to whom . at different places there is an Email menu entry , such as D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ T@@ EP ) with email , tool tool@@ bar buttons with email , in the context menu of files and folders .
resources can be up@@ loaded into our main archive , from where all other &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; users can be reviewed and only available when our Team need it as a correct and useful to release the resources that it guarantees a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . this means that the resources are guaranteed for our Team as well as for later users .
when up@@ loading , you will be asked for their private G@@ PG key ( the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not stored ) , or in the case that you have several keys , you may have a look at . in the dialog New resource needs to remain un@@ loaded ( URL preview can remain empty ) and with click OK to load the up@@ loading .
upload the menus can be up@@ loaded by the menus D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ T@@ EP ) menu tool@@ bar , and in the context menu of files and folders in the template and scripts .
after downloading a resource , even before the installation , examined &amp; quantitative information ; the integrity of the resource is war@@ ned and it may be canc@@ eled . please read the warning messages carefully . if the integrity and the resource is properly signed , a message appears with the indication of the resource of the resource .
it is possible to work on XML languages which is currently not supported by &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us , but it can be time consuming , because hundreds of day files could be necessary in tag@@ XML format . it gives the sim@@ pler way to allow an D@@ TD automatically into a D@@ T@@ EP package .
the conversion can be used from the menu D@@ TD Lo@@ ading and Convert D@@ TD . select the .@@ d@@ t@@ d file with the D@@ TD @-@ description that should be used . afterwards , the following dialog appears :
target name : the newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / quantity / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! DO@@ C@@ TY@@ PE Defin@@ itions : the string , that in ! DO@@ C@@ TY@@ PE tag , such as HTML PU@@ BL@@ IC - / / W@@ 3C / / D@@ TD HTML 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional / / EN ht@@ t@@ p / / / ht@@ m@@ l@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ d@@ t@@ d will appear
fine adjustment of D@@ T@@ EP after conversion : when activated , bring &amp; quantitative details ; after conversion the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; -@@ Editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us , there are some key concepts . to understand these and full benefits from &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us . this chapter should be addressed to them with these fundamental concepts , without their understanding &amp; quantitative details .
this distinction is divided into three areas : global , locally and projection areas . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; parall@@ ap@@ l@@ us ;
global elements are available for each , the &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; it uses everything that is marked as globally , in common order structure of &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; this enables the group of administ@@ rators to secure various tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in global tree that are available to each in a multi@@ user environment on the system .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development for a single user . these are custom patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory , so that they can use only this user personally .
project @-@ based elements are available only within a specific project . this can be everything by &amp; CSS ; designs up to tool@@ bars with special actions especially for the files of a particular project . simply said that this is most limited size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which means the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project .
the &amp; quantitative information ; MDI ; consists of some main areas : the editorial window , the building views , the ant@@ it@@ ators with information and tool@@ bars . please strike in , and for further information about these areas .
you can click the ant@@ it@@ re@@ iter to the right mouse button to obtain a context menu with the current document called entries , such as close to the current , other or all kart@@ ei@@ re@@ ites , new , delete or up@@ loading of the document , jump to a book@@ marks or execution of CV@@ S command to the current document .
right click in the Edit@@ orial section regarding the revised document content , such as basic processing steps ( cut / copy / paste ) , adaptation of the mouse under mouse poin@@ ter , or open the file , if the strings under the mouse poin@@ ter a file .
at the top end of the editors are the tool@@ bars of the Ed@@ itors . currently , &amp; quantitative ; 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional are shown as standard for which a set of tool@@ bars will be shown . in the course of the further expansion of &amp; quantitative , the tool bars will be adapted to the new features and thus connected user needs .
the use of tool bars is really easy . if they want to add into their document , then click the icon that the day represents , then you can add the data for this just added day . you should add a day that has multiple attributes ( like anchor ) , you can fill in a dialog of different fields .
the building views ( Q@@ IT ; ) enable it to navigate to the information &amp; quantitative information ; to navigate to open and cross @-@ strips . in the diagram with ant@@ lers are available for files , project , pattern templates , docum@@ entations , attributes and documentation building views .
project management is a powerful tool which provides &amp; quantitative information ; this view shows all the files in the project and allows the management of the files in the project with right mouse click . actions like adding , removing , upload or del@@ etion of files from storage medium can be carried out using the context menu .
another option of &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc ; It is available to you all possibilities .
templates can be divided into three categories , depending on which connection they are used . the category depends on &amp; quantitative information . global templates are always available , local templates only for the respective users and templates in projects are only available in the project . more to templates can be found in .
here you can find information about the available script languages . the concept of the integration in Global , Local and project also works here . by clicking with the left mouse button you can call the available information to a script . via the right mouse button , further functions are available , such as the script to start , edit or send an email .
with this view , one shows the internal structure of the active document . by left @-@ click of an element , the cur@@ sor is placed on the position of the element . by the right click of an element , a list of commands will open in terms of navigation and the loading of the tree .
this tree appears under the other architectural views . with it , man@@ fast attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces can change . that &apos;s the contents of all available attributes with a few clicks .
here is the complete documentation for Web technology for your development . it can be downloaded documentation for &amp; quantitative details ; from the quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; it can create their own documentation , and can be viewed and viewed by adding a folder doc to a project .
as standard , &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; two ant@@ lers at the bottom end of the window can be reached via the useful information window and the problem window .
this cart@@ ei@@ re@@ iter shows information about each in Quant@@ a running script . for example , the D@@ TD uses the current document and all changes to the D@@ TD .
this cart@@ ei@@ re@@ iter shows all the errors in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; quantitative pl@@ et@@ us ; scripts that are executed , give all error messages ( as it gives ) in this window .
the &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; tool bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command . the chocolate set aside is the possibility to define your prec@@ epts as symbols in &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us .
another function of &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; is the ability to send a tool bar with an email . &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; sends the tool bar as a compressed T@@ ar archive via &amp; e @-@ mail ; if they get a tool bar in an email , they can secure this in &amp; quantitative , like any other backup and load !
it is reasonable if you want to adjust the place of &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; it has auto@@ conf number of options to get to the configure script . to configure a complete list of all options , specify . / configure --@@ help . the options are simple to understand and not executed .
if you have problems with starting &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; you should check if your path contains &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folders . also you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in the P@@ AT@@ H . same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; is a web development tool for K@@ DE surface . &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; was optimized for a rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful features .
during labor , best &amp; HTML ; editor , the developers of &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us , began to deal with an obvious idea : what would be , if &amp; quantitative ; an independent , exten@@ dable mark@@ up languages would be ? well , this would make it the absolutely great web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer limited to clean &amp; HTML ; it is no longer limited to a general and comprehensive web development tool . it is now easy to define it in &amp; XML ; then it should be &amp; pos@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; it should be the appropriate &amp; IDE ; for that .
well , to the above claim must be fixed , making &amp; quantitative information ; as a product on the outstanding efforts of the whole &amp; k@@ de ; development community is based on ? thanks to &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ rum@@ ours is not only this possible , but it allows users and developers , &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; so you need to enlarge it for their needs .
&amp; Ex@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; allows to enhance productivity with intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( MDI ; ) . this may increase the productivity almost any task . by the program comp@@ ilers , it can be able to see &amp; quantitative information . ( more about it can be found in . )
&amp; Quant@@ a ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it has been designed for fast web development and has been developed quickly to a mature editor with many powerful features .
&amp; Quant@@ a ; Plus is not associated with commercial versions of &amp; Quant@@ a ; the original developer left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more in the detailed documentation is with help : / Quant@@ a ( either this URL in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / Quant@@ a execute ) .
&amp; Quant@@ a ; currently developed and supported by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de.@@ org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de.@@ org .
a fast @-@ speed list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time when you can open a file , which is not located on it , the oldest entry is taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . check in the section via templates . you should try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project deposit box , only one error is reported .
converted from the cli@@ p@@ board there , special characters contained in the cli@@ p@@ board there are special signs to &amp; HTML ; so they are correct and not to be understood from browser as form@@ att@@ ing instructions .
convert the text from the cli@@ p@@ board in &amp; URL ; -@@ In@@ scriptions , which the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s is primarily used to add &amp; URL ; s in the Anker day .
automatically switches the blocking selection or out . that allows you to select text blocks with the help of the &amp; Shift .
goes directly to a line number . that &apos;s very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; -@@ script error messages are available !
sear@@ ches for a string or regular expression in selected directory . a type gre@@ p or SE@@ D with GUI and pre@@ defined expres@@ sions to help you .
displays the message window at or not on . this is the window where you can see the display of scripts and deb@@ ug@@ ger .
outlet and Swit@@ ching on the problem repor@@ ters at the bottom edge of the &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; the problem repor@@ ter is activated as soon as you changes to the structural tree .
shows the symbol spl@@ itting right from the main window . this column allows you to place the book@@ marks with a mouse click .
when it is book@@ marks in the current file , they will be appearing in the menu with the entries predicted or next , depending on the position of the cur@@ sor in the document .
wire Bookmark the documents appear in the menu group@@ ed after the fil@@ en@@ ames of the other documents .
a non @-@ exist@@ ent project from the hard drive . &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; projects are stored with the extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
sear@@ ches the project directory according to new files that could be there . that allows for example graphics files to your project folder or a sub @-@ file and then add them to the project .
load the files in your project to the server . the list of available transportation methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and whether you have further inputs / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
att@@ itudes , such as &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; the project is managed . in the chapters &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Projects find the details explained .
invites a project tool bar . these are kept in project management / tool@@ bars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to store your tool@@ bars . allows you to select the type of tool bar : locally or project .
open a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . that will only create the name . actions are stored by settings . tool@@ bars are stored via tool tool@@ bars or you will be asked if you want to save the tool bars .
remov@@ es a tool bar from the field of view . that del@@ etes it not from the hard drive . if you have not saved the tool bar , you will be asked if you want to do this .
with this you can send your own tool bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; that the tool bar is present in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool bar as attachment .
enables the up@@ loading of tool bars to the main server , where any other can access it .
load an &amp; D@@ TD ; you have done or anything else made it and convert into the &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; own sound format .
load / ref@@ res@@ ric the functional@@ ities from the &amp; D@@ TD ; is meaning@@ ful if the functional@@ ities from the &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; to renew , without the whole &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; if this globally is and a write permission in the global K@@ DE folder is not f@@ ails to load the shop .
this menu contains a list of tags that are available in the currently loaded tool@@ bars . if the default ( HTML ; ) tool bar is loaded , there is a menu of menu that contains the list of tags / actions in this tool bar .
allows access to the current day setup dialog if there is one . this entry is always available in the menu tags , followed by &amp; D@@ TD ; -@@ specific under@@ men@@ tions .
activated or de@@ activated the intelligent insertion of tags . currently , this is only working with ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ Ds . intelligent insertion means that &amp; quantitative details ; the insertion is denied by means of tool bar if this day contra@@ di@@ cted the rules .
in the plug @-@ ins menu , the available plug @-@ ins listed below are listed below . clicking on the activated plug @-@ ins de@@ activated .
select the syn@@ taxes for current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schem@@ ata depends on der@@ k@@ ate ; -@@ version .
sel@@ ects the type of line identification . very useful if you know people who use other OS platforms to develop . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
check the syntax of the current document on selected &amp; D@@ TD ; using the external application T@@ id@@ y .
Instant switch between the different types of user interface . by some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , the switch @-@ off times may need or un@@ nice graphics . recommended is the card set mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub @-@ window mode , which corresponds to the display in &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; 3.2 and earlier .
additionally contains this menu for any open sub@@ window an entry . with selection of a entry , the corresponding sub@@ window will be activated .
the status of the status bar at the bottom edge of the &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us , switches off or off .
the changes in this dialogue decreases every application that use the K@@ HTML @-@ part including the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ web browsers .
jud@@ ging the behaviour of the editor &apos;s behavior . in the documentation of &amp; Kate . it is necessary for details .
a dialog appears where you can delete entries from the tool@@ bars or which can change the sequences .
this should generate a relief according to the mouse poin@@ ter , but is not implemented yet .
&amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with each Open Source Projekt , developers can always use help . if they want to support &amp; quantitative details ; development in financial form , you will find the way here .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be completed best from top to bottom , as for example , after filling the project called the whole directory structure for the rest of the project , all these paths and author information fields can be completed later with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project characteristics .
here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , file will be automatically filled .
this is the name of &amp; quantitative information ; -@@ Project File . by default , it has the name of the project in lower@@ case and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here is the server address of the machine to which you will be able to access local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ examples .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 ) are possible .
if you are leaving this field empty , the default settings of the chosen protocol are used . depending on the setup of the remote computer an adaptation may be necessary .
this is the folder where templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a common collection of files used for different projects should be used instead of the standard .
this is the folder where the tool bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . when a common collection of files used for different projects should be set instead of the standard .
allows you to insert files from the local file system into the project . multiple files or whole folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . at ser@@ ver@@ side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
early , if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project , are to be mounted . if a project is started on new , not an@@ h@@ aken .
with this option , all files and folders are displayed within the main folder and you can make a precise selection according to expertise .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by clicking hooks or , by removing the Hä@@ k@@ ah , out of the project .
the latest screen of the new project assistant contains three settings that can simpli@@ fy your work . these settings can be up@@ loading in the menu with project Properties in the menu window in the sub @-@ window profiles or with the Shift Shift Shift ; F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the project assistant and are described in . additional entries are explained below .
a list of file names ( plac@@ eholder is possible ) , which are re@@ vo@@ iced with projects such as project folders .
additional option to the above , also files that are listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ Sign@@ s are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded when opening the project . can be read more about project views .
with this you can select the desired deb@@ ug@@ ger . currently , G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plug@@ in can be set in . the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plug@@ in can be set using the options button . in the error search is described .
in the sub@@ window profiles , high @-@ la@@ de@@ profiles ( see in ) can be set , as well as the display of a building block for the contents of the server for every profile by hand a separate building view for every profile .
in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , processed or deleted a ma@@ iling list . see details .
in the sub @-@ window configuration , one can change event actions and modify these actions , if an earlier event occurs , such as that a file may occur , such as the Backup of a file . see the details .
standard opens &amp; pos@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the last project that was opened . this behaviour is currently not influenced .
to open a different project , select Open Project ... from the menu Project or the Symbol Open Project can be opened from the tool@@ bar . the dialog box will be displayed and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
when &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us is closed , the project file will be saved automatically . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , if &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us . the same happens if you load a new project .
the project developers have free access to the files in the project . there , the files can be managed in the current project .
just like , however , the entries are opening and opening with ... in the right mouse button open context menu :
various profiles can be selected here . profile contains information about the place of up@@ loaded files . see .
allows removing of the current profile . if only one profile is present , the button is b@@ lown to prevent removing .
the password will be kept in the core memory and is necessary for programming . this option is useful , if necessary up@@ loading of files is necessary and the rather un@@ secure password on the plate does not come into question .
this will stop the transfer or leave the dialog when you change your opinion before up@@ loading .
in &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; you can upload many high @-@ speed profiles to different servers . when working or creating a profile , this dialogue will be displayed :
that is the server name to be copied to the files . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed K@@ IO slaves . at least , you should select from &amp; FTP ; , file ( locally ) and NFS .
the port for transfer . usually , it must not be changed , except the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port .
depending on your attack@@ ers , this is either a tim@@ es@@ aving function or a danger . use it to your discre@@ tion . the password is stored on the plate , so it can &apos;t be easily read , but everyone with programming skills can be easily seen in plain text .
a project view is just a set of files and tool@@ bars . it may be able to use many views in a project , i.e. through simple exchange of view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently open files and tool@@ bars .
views may be stored in the menu Project or the Project tool@@ bar , which can be stored or deleted via Settings tool tool@@ bar .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; with which one has to do most . this helps not only increase productivity but also allows adaptation of &amp; quantitative information ; at its own work .
as mentioned above are tool@@ bars in &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; best about the menu tool@@ bars can be made easy . use and add to the tool . adding tool@@ bars will be treated down in the section adding tool@@ bars .
the tool bars and symbols can be set to either by context menu ( right click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which you can remove any actions such as tool bar , tool@@ bar buttons or tool@@ bars , which can be set in the dialog where can be displayed on this or other tool@@ bars .
by calling the context menu to a action ( icon ) on a tool bar , the entries can be removed and action displayed that are self explan@@ atory .
the tool bars and the actions on them can be set up in the menu with settings tool@@ bars ... and setting up actions ..
templates are essentially docum@@ ent@@ el@@ ette , code cut@@ ters and files for lin@@ king . &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; used Templates basically like a usual file system with extended organization and interfaces . we can copy , post@@ p@@ one or any of the system available in the pre @-@ deposit box . templates have in &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; in about the restrictions you will present for the file system .
some with &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; included templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions set before any template prior to use .
binary is all that is not pur@@ er . it can be inserted every file except text , images , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc . binary templates are usually inserted in documents using links ( e.g. images with IM@@ G sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples see templates under global templates . further information on templates tree is available .
documents can be created from any text document . based on this templates , new documents can be created . normally , a simple report for the purpose and organis@@ es the work in a corresponding way to be efficient . some examples may be found under global templates . see also for more information on templates tree .
this kind of templates is useful if not a new document is based on a template but the same text area always to be inserted into documents . you can find anything from a comment on a final note up to a complete menu of Javascript or Perl . see for more information on templates tree .
as the name says , this templates serve for all websites as templates . you are a collection of different documents organized in a file structure , summarized in a compressed t@@ ar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; quantitative information .
create a document structure to expos@@ ing ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and choose File As template to save local template ....
as soon as this is , note that ( even if there is a project templates ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look at the presentation of the project .
select text in your document and click File As template to store choice as local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be easily drawn with drag and shut@@ down to the building site templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : copy the file only into a pre@@ ference folder . it can be used for all file management functions such as pulling and storing or add the file @-@ tree of Con@@ quer@@ or .
one can click on a file tree or in the project files tree @-@ view to a folder and secure site template to enter a name for the template and secure it . as standard , it can be saved in the project folder , but of course it can also be saved as local or global template .
project templates allow a very goal oriented forward way . you can attach head@@ lines and foot@@ lines or dynam@@ ically with &amp; PHP ; create , add files or inter@@ link with them . additionally , one can keep some things when using templates in projects very deep in the eye .
the template structure in the sub@@ window template is based on the files stored in $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps / quantity / templates and / quantity / templates / quantity / quantity / templates . each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers , as stated above .
to define the behaviour of a folder is in the template overview with right mouse button click on the folder and select in the context menu tab . the following dialog appears :
a selection field with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection will be hidden as soon as the attri@@ bute attributes is checked .
this is by default , it is activated for everything except for the stem end . if a trunk folder would be set in principle , it would be explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder , the bl@@ ah would appear with something like text component . if nothing appears , it is likely to be found in a pedi@@ at@@ folder .
allows one added or presented text for templates in this file . this could be general head@@ lines or foot@@ lines for all templates for a particular project and allows you to equi@@ p all templates with special head@@ lines / foot@@ lines a whole presentation with the matching head@@ lines / foot lines .
in addition , using the context menu ( indicate the right mouse button ) on a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and add templates from one place to another .
&amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; provides two modes : V@@ PL ; &amp; Editor and V@@ PL ; the first mode replaces the text editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the Second spl@@ its for the editor window in two parts : the source editor and the V@@ PL editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it invites you to edit a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; then you can edit and modify the source code editor in which the changes carried out in the V@@ PL ; editor in the source code is visible .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor at a document that contains &amp; PHP . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL editor . to edit this text , it is necessary to edit this text editor . to edit &amp; PHP , there is no plans to change this behavi@@ our@@ al code .
the second mode works exactly like the first , except that simultaneously , the changes in both source editor and the V@@ PL editor will be activated and the cur@@ sor in the source editor and in the V@@ PL editor will already be activated , the key pressure is activated by the active cur@@ sor of a window to the others , whereby the position is retained in the document .
the sync distance between the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and the source editor can be set via settings Quant@@ a .... To option of V@@ PL ; - View may automatically choose between synchron@@ ization after one click or automatically . in the selection automatically the recommendation can be set too . in principle , the recommendation can be set for fast computer and a large span for slow motion .
suppose you want to change the title of the website , it is possible to select the title of un@@ visible tags when working with the V@@ PL ; editor is also called , as soon as a new document with the V@@ PL ; editor is also called . this is used to change the suspension of the hanging factor . this enables you to change the following :
met@@ a tags allow storage of information about the document , e.g. bu@@ zz@@ words for Internet search engines . met@@ a @-@ elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . one click on the list makes the change of content , such as key words in the column name and key@@ word Key@@ word 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way of designing pages in browser . you can add CSS rules with the buttons below the list or delete a change on the list is just like the met@@ a @-@ elements . the editing of CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to insert a external CSS style template by clicking on the file and select the corresponding file .
the cur@@ sor is used as in a text processing , not possible by reason with arrows , possible . under rare circumstances , the cur@@ sor is used as usual . lyrics can be inserted by in@@ ti@@ pping and be extingu@@ ished by pressing or distance .
to add tags will be made in the same way about tool bars , as in the source editor . it is too notice that the insertion of tags will not be removed e.g. if a Anker day , enc@@ ir@@ cl@@ ed with text needs , each other ambient anchor is removed .
some tool bars like the tables assistant or the lists are disabled . they will later work in &amp; V@@ PL ; will work later on &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists can be used .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for exam@@ ining styles . in contrast to other programs for styles , the search for specific elements are possible and the execution of styles can be tra@@ cked .

so there are many graphic tools for the same . why so &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain short , why I have written .
the merger was very complicated , because one of the contributions had made many changes , and at the same time a lot of jobs had changed . another programm@@ ers had changed much text in the same file . the result were numerous conflicts in the assembly .
the program used by me showed me only the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly had changed in these lines . and there was no indications of the places where perhaps only the ref@@ res@@ ation had changed . the gathering of these changes was a small album .
that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could be the difference within one line and changes to white characters . later there were added any amount of other useful features .
for example , if you want to compare quick text , copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board and add it in one of the comparison window .
a function which made a lot of work was the same and inter@@ act of folders . this function was related and diff@@ 3 ; almost in a full file browser .
also 3 @-@ way cl@@ ut@@ ors are fully supported . this is useful if two persons can work and make changes in one piece of co@@ de . the original file ( the base ) helps to make detailed changes . in this editor , you can even edit the result . in this editor , you can even edit the result . the screenshot shows three Qu@@ ell files at the merge :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; helps you also complete the same and merge complete folder . this screen photo shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; when I will perform :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences between today &apos;s colour monitors . if you often have to check code , you will like this function .
differences in white character and tab@@ ul@@ ators are displayed visible . if lines only differ in a certain number of white character , one can see it at a glance at the column on the left side . ( no off@@ ense more , if no man changes the influence . )
if a file is equal , and the other one distingu@@ ishes itself in one line , then the color indicates that the file is different . red color means that both are different files .
if all files have the same name , but in different folders , you can use the Ti@@ p@@ desk work by using only the file names of the first file . example :
diff@@ 3 folder , folder 1 folder 2 folder target folder k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 3 -@@ o target folders
the opening @-@ dialog allows manual integration of file names , selection above the file browser ( file ... ) or select a last open file from the list box . the opening dialog displays your selection and shows it to the next time . you don &apos;t need to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C , the analysis of the differences with two files will be performed .
about the button folder ... you can also select a folder , if you select a folder , then select the same or merge of folders . if for A a file is selected , then used &amp; diff@@ 3 ; the file names from A in the two other folders .
if M@@ erging is crossed , the input field is active for the target and can process it . however , it is not necessarily necessary to define a output file . you can do this step later when saving .
the setup button opens a dialog with settings . here you can define options before starting with the same / merge .
sometimes you do not want to compare all the file but only parts of a text box . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to select text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board into the active window . the comparison begins immediately . in opening @-@ dialog you need to select files , you can simply lock the dialog easily with the off button .
you can also drag and use : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from a editor and let him fall on a comparison window .
what thought is behind it ? sometimes , a file like several similar functions . if you would like to figure out what these functions would like to load them in &amp; diff@@ 3 ; download and compare these relevant sections . now you can simply copy and compare these relevant sections .
note : currently you can extract nothing out &amp; diff@@ 3 ; only let &apos;s turn out the text in a comparison window .
warning : some editors interpre@@ t the pulling and copy of text into another program as cut and insert ( instead of copying and insert ) . in such cases , your original data could be lost .
in the upper part of each text box is the info line . the info line of the spring window contains the characters A , B or C , the file names and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window will rest for a while on line . then a small relief window will display the full name . )
the three sources of sources are the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( this default settings can be changed over the settings . )
if a difference is recognized , one sees the colour that the file distingu@@ ishes itself . if both files differ , the default color is especially useful if you compare three files . this is very useful in the next section ( merge ) .
left in addition to the text is the coll@@ ateral column . if differences were found , the column shows the corresponding color . with some programming languages where white sign is not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + e.g. , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , relevant for the price processing and in few , rare cases . )
the vertical line , which separates the abstra@@ cts column from the text , is interrupted by the digits where the respective source file has no lines . if the line switch is activated , the line is indicated on broken lines .
the result window ( below the reference point ) also has a info line with the inscription issue : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; Ge@@ change &#93; if you have handled the result . usually it contains text , but often also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are dis@@ band@@ ed , the Save is de@@ activated ! ! ! ( use the buttons to the most dissolved / un@@ rest conflict to find any remaining conflicts . )
if only two comparative numbers are used , any difference in the same time must be solved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the window will be displayed in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed in the windows . this group will then be highlighted by the current group . this group will be highlighted by the color background and it will appear on the left a black beams .
sometimes , through the automatic merge or through manual editing , no further line is left in the group ; then it is displayed in these lines of text &amp; lt ; no line in the source code ; this text is neither in the final stored file , still in a marking which might be able to copy and add what else .
the text &amp; lt ; Coll@@ aboration with con@@ sign@@ ment ; appears however in the cli@@ p@@ board when you copy such text from the result window . do not be careful with this function .
note : if when selecting the sources are igno@@ red the options , ignore or Ig@@ nor@@ iere C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are treated as white character .
this will navigate mainly to the pictures and mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you are in one of the window , you can use the arrow buttons at the beginning , at the beginning , end @-@ end , Str@@ g @-@ beginning and Str@@ g @-@ end , Si@@ w can also be used by other programs . in addition to the vertical image line , you can also click navig@@ ating to Navig@@ ate .
in the eye window , you can also use the other keys for editing . using the Ins@@ ert button you can switch between single @-@ feet or ski@@ pping mode . ( default is the feeding mode . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the clust@@ ering columns syn@@ thes@@ izes the view of all windows to the start of the respective group ( as already in the Section merge and the ed@@ itable expul@@ sion windows ) .
the tool bar contains seven buttons to navigation with which you can jump to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ down / C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture on downhill ) or to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ down / C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture downhill ) or to the next / previous conflict . therefore , all conflicts must still be considered conflict . therefore , the conflict must be classified between dissolved and un@@ affected districts .
to copy the selection into the cli@@ p@@ board , you need to copy the copying button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or Str@@ g @-@ Ins@@ ert ) . if it is enabled , you should automatically copy the cli@@ p@@ board automatically and copy the manual copying . be careful , because you might over@@ write the content of the cli@@ p@@ board .
Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ends are stored according to the registered operating system \ \ r \ . K@@ diff@@ 3 does not use the line @-@ off range \ \ r \ . K@@ diff@@ 3 reserves the line end of the source files , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also do not use bin@@ aries .
the options and list of the most recently used files will be stored automatically and re@@ produced at the next start . ( pop @-@ up menu &gt; Cat . 3 ... )
choose a let@@ tering with fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog displays scriptures with variable width , you should not use them . )
if you dis@@ able this option , differences in short text will be displayed . if the chosen font is not supported , nothing happens .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be rounded . on these systems the button settings automatically introduces an un@@ just color .
when this option is enabled , the appropriate number of space is inserted when pressing the tab@@ ulator key . otherwise , a tab@@ ulator @-@ character is inserted .
when you press the input or return , the re@@ iter@@ ation of the prior line will be automatically used for the next line .
when this option is activated , any selection will automatically be copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . manually copy the manual in the cli@@ p@@ board .
you can choose which type of line type you prefer to store . the default value is the generally usual selection of the operating system used .
at the same of files try &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , all complete identical lines will be igno@@ red in the source files . only during this first step , white characters can be igno@@ red . in this step , white sign will not be igno@@ red . in this step , white sign will not be igno@@ red .
some editors ( on some systems ) store a car back@@ drop &apos; \ &apos; at the end of one line , but then they could only be igno@@ red with different sizes on the side @-@ side comparison , but then you might be changed using different sizes on the side @-@ side comparison , however , when this option is treated differently , however , this option has to be de@@ activated . in default , this option is de@@ activated .
the default option is de@@ activated . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are igno@@ red . the results are nevertheless displayed , but they are treated like white characters .
the default option is de@@ activated . changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters .
intense after even smaller sub@@ missions . the option is activated in default . it is effective with complicated and large files , but slowly with very large files .
in the Autom@@ atically @-@ ski@@ p mode , this setting is determined as long the result of the selection is displayed before going to the next un@@ ing conflict .
solves automatically all conflicts in white characters being used as a source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful if white character can be used in many files . note that the automatic selection will also refer to numbers or comments when the options are igno@@ red or Ig@@ ou@@ ting C / C + + -@@ comments .
these options are treated in chapter for scanning of folders and copy of a merge . check for details below documentation for the folder comparison and merge .
if a file is stored and already a older version exists , then the original version is the suff@@ ix .@@ original file . if already there is a backup file with the suff@@ ix .@@ original there will be removed without further backup .
it does not fit the language of user interface . changing this option does not affect the current program . you have to finish &amp; finish . ( this option is not available in K@@ DE version of &amp; diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is discontinued globally . )
the following coefficient settings can be set separately for each entry . if you use this option to all entries the upper setting is used .
over the selection fields for encoding is a short notice that the local coding is not changed . ( this can not be changed here and has an inform@@ al character . )
custom@@ ize the file coding for source files . this is influenced how special characters are treated and interpreted . since the coding for each file can be adjusted individually , even files with different encoding can be compared and merged .
if you have handled a file , you can specify what encoding should be used to store .
if you define pre @-@ processing error , they could not operate with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files can function 16 @-@ bit Unicode , but the pre @-@ processing command can only handle with 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can define the coding of the output of pre @-@ processing .
switch off to supp@@ ress highlighted changes in white characters in text or reviews . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments when the options are igno@@ red or Ig@@ ou@@ ting C / C + + - comments . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode all differences in one colour co@@ ded over@@ ded column are displayed . after selection of A &amp; B ; B , A &amp; B ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; B ; C is displayed next to the normal nor one second super@@ vised column with the necessary information .
sometimes you would like to use the available space on the screen for long lines . aperture simply the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu . )
include the comparison window next to each other or in each other . this can also be useful for advertis@@ ements of long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you consider the differences and decide to convert the files . a simple click will automatically compare the merge and uses the file names of the last source file as default file for output file . ( if this function is used to run the merge , then the name of last used output file will be retained . )
for reading a file it will be delivered first to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ processor , which may apply exactly your needs . you can remove this function e.g. for cutting inter@@ fer@@ ing parts or to correct the pressing .
for reading a file it is given first to this external command . if also a normal pre @-@ processing command was given ( see above ) , then the output of this command is used only . you can write your own pre@@ processor , which meets exactly your needs . each input line must have an appropriate output line .
the thought behind is to enable the user more flexibility when setting the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is needed , and most users would like to program the self itself . however , the good news is that in most cases SE@@ D or per@@ l completely sufficient .
use this pre @-@ processing command to convert the input in upper@@ case letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ &apos; characters in the first cl@@ utch string . \ \ 1 converts the found text in upper@@ case letters .
CV@@ S and other version control systems use some key words to automatically add character strings ( info : / c@@ vs / key@@ word \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you experiment with SE@@ D , you might be able to understand it and perhaps like you like this regular expres@@ sions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
the igno@@ res of numbers is actually a built @-@ in function in K@@ diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for a further advance processing command for line top@@ .@@ SE@@ D &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Every character between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a suitable matches , and each hits will be replaced by nothing , so virtually deleted .
sometimes you might want to perform several items at one time . then you can use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the requirements of each other . example :
instead of SE@@ D you can also use something different like e.g. per@@ l -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ G@@ EX@@ P / replacement / switches &apos; . however , if SE@@ D \ \ ( and \ \ ) are needed for per@@ l just yet ( and ) without the lead &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre@@ processor are set for display and inter@@ act . further operations change only the data that the line @-@ down @-@ down @-@ al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus .
note : in rare cases if you use a normal price processing , the Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ab@@ d pre@@ processor sees the output of the normal driver processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful but as with any function , the text changed or differences , you can not notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case .
often you have to edit programmer in a file many files . for this reason , you can compare and merge complete folders with &amp; diff@@ 3 ; complete folders .
... for each object a proposal to merge ; you can custom@@ ize the proposal before the start ,
... you can simul@@ ate and simul@@ ate the simul@@ ated changes , without which they really perform ,
... causes selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with the selected objects ( F6 @-@ key ) ,
this is very similar to the same and merge of individual files . you just have to open files at the command line or in the dialog .
if three folders are run , folder 1 is used as basis . if no target folders was used , use &amp; diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folders .
note that only the comparison of folders will not start automatically , do not start the assembly . to run the merge , you must select the appropriate menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( see further details )
while reading the folder informs you a small news window over the current progress . if you break the scanning of the folder , only the files are listed until then compared .
when the scanning of the folder is completed , displays &amp; diff@@ 3 ; a list window with results on the left side ...
any file and folder where each folder was found during the scan , will be displayed here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple click .
the file structure is normally displayed together . you can use a folder by clicking on the + / - click on the object or simply using the arrow buttons for left / right . the directory menu contains two functions of all sub@@ directories , and all sub@@ directories can be folded up with which you can open or fold .
when you double click on a file , the file comparison is started and it appears a comparative window .
the symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) again . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other file , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details window to the selected object . if the merge is started automatically , you will be informed about problems of this type .
as shown in the above picture , in the columns A / B / C the colours red , green , yellow and black are used .
identical entries , the colour is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different .
folders are considered to be identical when you &apos;re all of the same content . then also folder the same color . with folders , the age is unusual for its color .
the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colours reflect the colors of a sheet , which is only green , then yellow and later , when it is old , is red .
... A and C identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical but not C : copy from C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C identical , but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C not have the same file type ( e.g. if A A folder and B is one file ) : error : contra@@ dic@@ tory file types . as long as such fl@@ acci@@ dental objects exist , the merge cannot be started .
... A and B didn &apos;t have the same type of file ( e.g. if A is a folder and B one file ) : error : contra@@ dic@@ tory file types . as long as such in@@ er@@ ous objects exist , the merge cannot be started .
the mode for synchron@@ izing is active if only two folders and no more explic@@ it target folders were specified , and if the option is synchron@@ ize synchron@@ ize , then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action is identical , so that both folders are identical . if for one entry ...
... A and B exist but not identical : bring together and save the result in both folders . ( the user can only see as the visible fil@@ en@@ ame for output file only B ; copied directly after the merge . copied &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
if two folders are run and select the option of new file instead of mer@@ ging ( un@@ certain ) , then select &amp; diff@@ 3 ; the date of files and changes the newer file to copy . if the files are different , but the date is identical .. Sol@@ ange such an error cannot be removed . such a mistake cannot be started .
while playing a file after the other hand , a status column shows a distance when the merge has been successful , and according to other messages when it is unexpected , you should make a last review and see if the status is everywhere in order .
if set in setup dialog the file comparative method is chosen , K@@ diff@@ 3 will display further columns . these contain the number of uns@@ ast@@ eries , dissolved , not white and white conflicts . ( the column for dissolved conflicts will be displayed only if three folders are compared or merged . )
you can either run the just selected entry ( file or od@@ ner ) , or all entries at one time . if you have selected all inter@@ mitt@@ ent actions ( even in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start the merge .
please note : if you have no target folder , then the three @-@ file @-@ merge mode C is used as target , in the two @-@ file coll@@ ision is chosen as target and used when synchron@@ ize A and / or B as target .
if you have chosen a target folder , please check if all entries should be displayed in the target folders . there are some options to ski@@ p through certain entries due to certain entries . check these options to avoid un@@ pleasant surprises :
to merge all entries : select directory entry / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the key short@@ cut ) . in order to insert only the current entry , select action of the current element or press F6 .
if by contra@@ dic@@ tory file types there are still inv@@ alid merge actions , a message appears on incorrect elements . you can choose a valid promotion for them .
if you merge all entries , the dialog window appears with the options to execute and break Sim@@ ulate and break out .
select Sim@@ ulate if you would like to see what would happen without the really changes . you will then get a detailed list of all the actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then causes specific actions with all entries through . if a manual load is necessary ( run a single file ) then a merge window will open ( note the screen photo ) .
if you are finished using a file , select the directory entry / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you are not saved , an appropriate dialog appears . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; his work will continue with the next entry .
if &amp; diff@@ 3 ; on an error , a message appears and detailed status information . at the conclusion of the list you should try to try out the cause of the problem . if you want to continue to select the problem of the problem , or do the problem to solve another action for the entry or proceed the problem to others before using the merge .
if some entries have been merged individually , see &amp; diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in current session ) and leads them not even again . even if the merge has been run or not stored , these entries will be considered to be done . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again .
the Settings menu from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 setup ... ) now has a section called directory coll@@ ation with these options :
only files displayed on the stated pattern are displayed in the element tree . separate plac@@ ings with a Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on ; . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . file does not need to match this pattern .
files and folders are displayed in this pattern are not displayed in the element @-@ tree . it may be more than one pattern , use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on ; as a divi@@ ding sign . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ O .
files and folders are displayed in this pattern are not displayed in the element @-@ tree . it may be more than one pattern , use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on ; as a divi@@ ding sign . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ O .
igno@@ red files that are also igno@@ red by CV@@ S . the big advantage is that this folder is specific to a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see below : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems , files have a 4 -@@ attri@@ bute . in other file systems , a leading point is marked as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files are displayed in the element tree or not . this option is switched on by default .
for links to files : if the option is switched off , symbolic link will be compared . if the option is switched on , the files are compared to the links . this is de@@ activated in default .
with links to files : if the option is switched on , the links are treated like normal folders and recur@@ sive . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not on possible records , a link would result into a final loop and remove &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ) This option is shut down in default .
a complete analysis of every file through and shows the statistics of statistics . ( the number of dissolved , un@@ for@@ ter , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binding analysis , and much slower if they contain any text . ( specify a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare great folders through a slow network , this is possibly faster to compare the amendment to and the file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain degree of safety . please do not use caution . this option is shut down in default .
similar to the confi@@ dential date . there is no real comparison instead . the files are considered as identical when when copying the change date lost . please use caution . this option is de@@ activated in default .
activ@@ ating the synchron@@ izing mode if two folders are compared and no target folders . in this mode , the suggestions will be identical to the merge that both folders are identical . also the results of the merge files are stored in both folders . this option is shut down in the default .
if there are differences in combination , the copying of the newer file is suggested as action . ( this will be considered uns@@ af@@ e , because the other file is not changed too . ) This option is shut down in any case .
if a file or folders will be replaced or deleted , then the original version is renamed and will receive the extension .@@ original when a old backup file with .@@ original extension has already existed , so this will also be deleted without further backup . this option is also enabled . this option is switched on in the default .
normally the folders track currency would be able to pull single files ; you can move the window divider with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want to switch the window divider in the window menu and switch to switch between directory and text boxes between the two views .
probably you prefer to compare a file easily using double @-@ click . however , there is also a corresponding menu entry . you can also run a single file directly , without the folder menu . as soon as you save the result , the status will be done , and the file will not run once again when you run the folder .
this status is however lost if you want to read the directory again : directory menu : new .
K@@ DE supports network transparent with help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders to open to local or remote computers .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has another syntax as local files and folders . some things you should note :
a path can be relatively und@@ ou@@ ched or .. . that &apos;s not possible with UR@@ Ls , these are always absolutely .
special characters must be m@@ asked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , idle &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named with the name / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes by the protocol . it follows a short list of limitations :
or it cannot be distinguished whether a link is pointing to a file or folder . then it is always assumed to mark a file as link target . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no possibility to process per@@ missions or change date . hence , the per@@ missions or change of change from the original . ( note that option is confi@@ dential in size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the main purpose of use is currently as the differences viewer in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op first launch the built @-@ in differences viewer . to start K@@ diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the differences viewer and then select In K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu .
normally you need &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . if it is used as K@@ Part , it takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the names of the original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then starts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the patch program to restore the missing file .
in the Con@@ quer@@ or , please click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview - K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this doesn &apos;t work if none of the original files does not work if the original files have changed since the generation of Patch @-@ file .
if &amp; diff@@ 3 ; as part is implemented , it only supports the same of two files , a very small tool bar and menu . the merge or the same of folders is not supported in K@@ Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ diff@@ 2 ( now he@@ w ) are already . furthermore , the name K@@ diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can lead to lead as the program diff@@ 3 from the sealing tool collection .
I use GPL programs already very long and have much learned about the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all the programm@@ ers who have gone this way or go to it .
you have compiled the program from sources and configure the configure script , probably not the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in the default setting , configure K@@ DE the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file you will find more information about this topic .
if only the number of white character is different , these lines are treated as identical ; if only one @-@ white sign is different , the line will not be identical . if the Lines is next to Each Other , this fol@@ is co@@ ver@@ sely this line is the case .
the editor is noted for any difference in the files where it starts and where he ends . this important information is simply lost when the result is simply saved as text file and it is too much effort to design extra a private file format that could store this information .
the effort was so far too large . you can always restore a certain version always through selecting a source A / B / C . to edit more large quantities of text , another editor should be used .
after removing the text is suddenly ; No sr@@ c lin@@ s ; published and the text cannot be extingu@@ ished . what does that mean and how can this be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; used already many colors for drawing sub@@ divide . more high@@ lighting would be conf@@ using and missing the purpose . do not use another editor .
many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all functions of &amp; diff@@ 3 ; use &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or newer .
as you can use K@@ diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE , you can find on the homepage .
a list of last changes can be found under ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3 sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ angel@@ og or in the Ch@@ angel@@ og in the source package .
to comp@@ ile &amp; diff@@ 3 ; comp@@ ile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; use the following command in the basic folder of &amp; diff@@ 3 ; -@@ Distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir gives the folder in your system , installed in the K@@ DE . if you are uns@@ af@@ e , you will find further details in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file .
da &amp; diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ akers should not be used when comp@@ iling . should , however , do trouble appear , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ ma@@ iling lists of it .
cut out ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or Shift ) copies into the cli@@ p@@ board and remove the selected text . add ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or Shift ) add the text from the cli@@ p@@ board to the current cur@@ sor position and replaces the current mark .
only differences : files that are identical in all the folders are not appear in folder , and therefore not in the target folder .
( in the current program version you need to update the folder to update this file with the update . )
there are only entries displayed , the differences are displayed . if the target folders cannot be copied to the target folders . if the target file is not already modified , they are missing after the merge . ( the behaviour is likely to be changed in a later program version . ) This option is shut down in default .
note the buttons to choose the source with the label A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines are attached to the end of the selected group ( if they already exist already ) . if the lines are already present , they are removed in clicking the button accordingly .
the default option is de@@ activated . the differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) will be treated like differences in white characters .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini@@ preview of all virtual work areas . it is quite convenient to change their running programs on the working area to stop them or shift it . this works both within a desktop and with several .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual work areas as well as those of running applications . applications can be selected and even be moved on the desktop and to others .
with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both within a desktop and other work@@ areas .
the context menu varies from where the right mouse button is clicked on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; however , the context menu will only be clicked on a application within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; however , the symbol and the name of the application as well as the entries are minim@@ ize , maxim@@ ize , on desktop and editing .
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . appears only when it was clicked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when it was clicked on an application .
if this check box is marked , windows can be moved within the &amp; p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other work@@ areas .
when this field is crossed , will appear in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the names of virtual work areas are indicated .
enabling this field lets you cross the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager . show the numbers of virtual work areas . it has been inter@@ sec@@ ted with the name , the names are to be ordained , &amp; eg ; 1 . work .
if this field is crossed , the background of each desk is displayed as a background in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager .
when this field is crossed , the running programs are displayed as small windows in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise , only the empty work@@ areas are displayed to allow their selection .
here the view of the program window is selected . simply displays simple rectangle with the propor@@ tions of the program window . icon shows the window with its standard symbol and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program . re@@ mark : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager can be determined : classic leaves &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ n grid , as well known as P@@ ager applications in some other windows . horizont@@ ally features all virtual work surfaces in a horizontal line and per@@ pendi@@ cular to a vertical row , which is very good for the presentation at the side of the desktop .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager Mini@@ program in the Control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , which can display window as symbols or with their contents . furthermore , he runs out of the control strip .
click the right mouse button within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; and subsequent removal of switch @-@ switches ... lets the dialog box appear .
currently that cannot be changed in the dialog for Settings , but you can do it manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ p@@ ag@@ err@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you have no write permission for the file , you have to register as a user root or to your system administrator . in this file you need to enter the keys win@@ dow@@ transparent mode and refer to the value . possible values are :

&amp; k@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that will constantly be expanded to develop new features . it is optimized for use on performance devices .
if you like &amp; k@@ mag , a window appears as pictured above . the main window of &amp; k@@ mag is displayed as a magni@@ fying window . in the following window will be shown as a magni@@ fication window .. The picture that is displayed in the magni@@ fying window is an enlarged area of the screen and is described in the following as a selection window .
in the default setting , setting up &amp; k@@ mag ; the area around the mouse poin@@ ter like a mobile micro@@ scope . alternatively , you can add a selected screen range in the magni@@ fying window ( selection point mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse poin@@ ter to the screen ( eg ; on the left ) .
if you want to avoid the mouse over the enlarged window , select the mouse poin@@ ter . please note that , &amp; k@@ mag is not able to recognize the form of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the default image ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ mouse poin@@ ter .
in the selection panel mode , you can custom@@ ize the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrows and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse over the magni@@ fying window and hold down the left mouse button , so you can move the contents of the magni@@ fying window and move . this also goes with the arrow buttons .
if you need to press the &amp; Shift , button or use the &amp; M@@ MB ; you can move the selection window .
using this combination you can change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the drop window will stand and only keep the lower right corner to move .
&amp; likes ; possesses a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , copy in a file to insert into the cli@@ p@@ board ( to insert it later in other applications ) , turn the image and much more .
starts or stops the update of the display . stopping the update make sure the required CPU time is 0 .
choose the ref@@ res@@ h rate ( Very low , straight , medium , high ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode , a selection window will appear . the selected area will be displayed in a window .
&amp; k@@ mag ; used automatically your set @-@ commands to save files , opening a new window , printing , new@@ bie ( with the button document again invite again in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; ) , Enlarge and cr@@ ushing &amp; etc ; .
k@@ v also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; is a magni@@ fying magni@@ fier ; you can use a magni@@ fier to use a micro@@ scope to use the print printer in a newspaper or a photo . this application is designed for various people from research : from research or artists to the Web@@ designer or looking handic@@ apped .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulate a mouse click on the same spot as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter a while on the same place . it is intended to help people who suffer the RS@@ I syndrome ( repet@@ itive strain relief ( jury syndrome ) and those of any mouse click pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulate a mouse click on the same spot as soon as the mouse avo@@ ids a while on the same place . it is intended to help people who em@@ ulate the p@@ iti@@ ves of the mouse . however , it can em@@ ulate the pulling with the mouse . however , this requires a little practice .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain , which is created when clicking on the mouse and helps to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you suffer from pain , who are using your computer to use a doctor if this is not yet done .
to show it even more : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is able to avoid dis@@ rup@@ tions when clicking with the mouse , it is against pain that is caused by the mouse because of the mouse , us@@ eless . and as with all ergonomic support , the result may exp@@ ire each differently .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and performs a mouse click soon as soon as you break the motion short .
if the intelligent move is activated , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a break after it is pressing the mouse button . now move the mouse , wait until the lot of the mouse button . on this way , you can do the drag with pressed mouse button . the intelligent approaches requires a little exercise , but you can get it quickly .
after the end of the mouse movement , this time has to be sufficient before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click is out .
if you are switched on , the tor@@ ch @-@ shift time ( 1 / 10 s ) is active . here the time is set , the mouse button is waiting until the mouse button is waiting to get rid of the mouse , if there is no effect due to the mouse .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now it is activated by clicking on the right and back , followed by a break , a click with the right mouse button . a slow Move to the left and back carries a double @-@ click . these movements will be saved in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time has started , but they can be changed later .
if the sound is delayed , you can move your reaction time . open the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; , go to sound &amp; multimedia , select there sound system and here the rider . there is a sli@@ der sound buffer you can adjust to a lower value to reduce the response time .
this setting is marked by &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at any start of &amp; k@@ de ; started . this function is currently only under &amp; k@@ de ; available at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments please draw the relevant documentation to find out how to start a program automatically .
sets all settings on the values which have been discontinued when opening the dialog . if you have already pressed the button , the settings are reset to users after the last pressing of users .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; initially with the pres@@ ets . in particular , the intelligent shi@@ fting should be turned off . if you are turned to the automatic mouse , you can then go on the intelligent move .
if you are using the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de if necessary .
first , you should make sure to make a mouse click without any effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or in order in the browser window which does not constitute a link . you can use the mouse to use such places where you want to use them again .
when your mouse is printed , you should clean your mouse . that &apos;s usually rather simple . the trick is that you can not only clean the mou@@ ths , but also the rolls that are in contact with the mouse ball .
first of all , you have to take out the mouse ball . as this happens , mouse to mouse . however , it should be clear if you look at the under@@ side of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the reels . these are attached to the sides of the hole in which the ball was used . the dirt and the pollution can be cr@@ ammed with a flat blade or your fing@@ ern@@ a@@ gel .
in very rare situations , the operating system breaks off the operating system of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; when you use the intelligent move , this means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool does not mean that the operation can no longer be able to termin@@ ate the mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use in another window manager and move one window .
the solution for this problem exists that you own a mouse click . this is the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; re@@ set and you can continue to work as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse click and put the cur@@ sor to another place .
solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor there . however , use the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop when you want to retri@@ eve your mouse over a neutral area . secure zones for mouse poin@@ ter . secure zones for mouse poin@@ ter &amp; eg ; the grey areas around the tool@@ bars and menus and the cover lines of windows .
I tried to work with the intelligent move , but I do not create it to edit text .
the intelligent move is a advanced feature of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it needs its time before you can move it to copy and to insert it into the cli@@ p@@ board , where you want to move the mouse with a pressing mouse button . however , there will probably only be some problems . here are some advice :
use the intelligent move not , if you just begin to start &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool . instead , use the text instead of a mouse and hold down the Shift key , while you move the mouse button to the other end of the text and move there again the mouse button .
therefore , use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this makes each time when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button p@@ ush@@ es a sound like a mouse click . so you can use the intelligent move , even without the audi@@ ble mouse click . however , you need for some exercise .
in order to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; you must be installed the X@@ test extension for &amp; X Window ; that should be the case most of the system .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse is only available when the system has a sound card and speakers and this is correct .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; when the mouse is short , once the mouse poin@@ ter briefly , this program was developed for people who suffer the RS@@ I syndrome and those working of the sy@@ ro@@ asts pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured that a certain time is waiting to start a pulling @-@ up before the mouse is left . in this way the drag and shooting with the mouse can be done .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program that can speak to the m@@ ute user their computer .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; users can speak the computer to themselves . the user can choose from a list with the talk of phr@@ ases which are to be found again .
on the first side of the assistant ( left @-@ foto ) , enter the command that will be used later for the language edition of text . further details can be found in the description of the catalogue .
on the second side , select the standard textbook for use . you can choose to choose the appropriate text password , without having to type them . the passages can be processed of course .
on the third side ( right screen photo ) determine the dictionary of your language . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of the individual words . in addition , you can read the word lists with an Open@@ Off@@ ic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , that only true sp@@ elling words are recorded in the words .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clearly listed and includes essentially a input field for the keyboard entries of your propositions ( the lower white field in screen photo ) and a rec@@ olle@@ ction memory of the already spoken sets ( the upper white field in screen photo ) .
if you have k@@ mouth ; right , you can type the propositions which you want to hear . each spoken set will be attached to the memory disc . you can choose from the propositions which are to be spoken again .
with the menu entry Settings k@@ mouth ; set up the setup dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two ant@@ lers , voice output and settings , the page word and page K@@ TT@@ SD language service .
in the input field of the card issue , enter the command to call the voice of the language . in the selection field below the input field , specify the character encoding , which will be transferred to the language generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . choose the check box when the text is unchanged as standard input to the language generator .
if the check box is not selected , the text is given as parameters . you can use the following plac@@ eholder :
of course the instruction on language version depends on your language generator . this command can be found in the documentation to your language generator . examples here are listed in the app@@ endix .
to be used as a language service as a language service , &amp; k@@ mouth ; as first try to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if that is successful , the other settings are available on this site and is currently being developed in SV@@ N . the option of this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
using the first selection field action in accordance with the selection of a text passage , which will be triggered by the scanning short@@ cut or by choosing a text passage through the menu box or in the strip of text box .
the selected text passage will be addressed directly and additionally inserted into the input field . the selected text passage will be transmitted directly into the input field at the beginning of the input field .
in the second selection field closing of the handling instructions for Text@@ pass@@ agen@@ buch , you can define whether the password @-@ password will be automatically saved .
with the selection of text password book , the book will be stored . if you refuse to select the password @-@ password , the password needs not stored . select before saving , it will be stored &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the password needs should be stored .
the page Wor@@ ff &apos;s page contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the words . in the main window depic@@ ts &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection field if this list contains more than a dictionary . with this selection field you can choose the currently used Dictionary for Wor@@ lds .
with the buttons on the right you can delete dic@@ tion@@ aries or add words , change the order of books or to them in a file . below the list you can set the name and select the language for the dictionary .
in this source , select the language of your language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the &amp; k@@ mouth ; the frequency of the individual words are simply determined by checking the occurr@@ ence . in addition , you can compare the Word list with an Open@@ Off@@ ic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , in order to submit only correctly written words into the new dictionary .
with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask what dic@@ tion@@ aries work together , and how these weights are to be done .
with this option , set a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly entered the dictionary automatically in the Dictionary you generate a dictionary with your voc@@ abul@@ ary .
the main window of the window for the processing of text pass@@ ag@@ les is divided into two parts . in the upper part , the towels are displayed as a tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit an selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the passage passage or the associated key@@ word . if you have chosen a text @-@ password , you can change only its name .
you can add actions like new passages and books , or select selected text passages and books either via the selection in the menu bar , in the tool bar or via a pop @-@ up menu .
you can change the order of text messages and passages by pulling with the mouse to the new position or the arrow buttons and the &amp; Alt ; -@@ button .
the chosen text is cut out and copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field a text section is selected , this is used , otherwise the selected areas of the drive storage .
the chosen text is copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field a text section is selected , this is used , otherwise the selected areas of the drive storage .
the currently active sentence is spoken . if text is in the input field , this is used , otherwise the selected propositions of the distortion is used .
this menu entry is crossed , a sliding tool bar with buttons for frequently used commands . the tool bar is arranged directly under the menu bar directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and pulling the tool bar can be moved to another place .
if this menu entry is crossed , a narrow l@@ ath in the lower part of the main window with point of view over the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed if not crossed , this status bar is hidden .
this menu entry is inter@@ changeable to display entries . the strip is displayed on the box window directly under the tool@@ bar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and pulling the tool bar can be moved to another spot .
probably you have the command for voice output not right or not fully entered . open settings k@@ mouth ; open settings ... , open the page General Settings and enter the command for voice output on the card issue language issue . ( see Settings for Voice syn@@ thesizer for further details . )
the Edinburgh University is a language version of the University of Edinburgh . currently , English , Spanish and W@@ alis@@ isch is supported . licence allows to use Festival free of charge and spread any restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting up language output , it is believed that festival is installed in the folder / usr / local / festival . the command to language version is then :
Free@@ T@@ TS is an in &amp; Java ; written voice generator . currently , it supports the English language language . the license allows you to use Free@@ T@@ TS free of charge and spread without restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for the installation of the language edition , Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the folder / usr / local / fre@@ utch . language version is then possible with one of the three following command examples :
for the third example , the option has to be switched on as default . ( this is the recommended example of Free@@ T@@ TS application . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ esh@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , therefore you need an additional program to put the text in phon@@ eme . the license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text in phon@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA , under the assum@@ ption that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA can be installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / m@@ bro@@ la .
unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax loves to be the last sign of the text , so that an additional character needs to be added . the full command is therefore better than in the other examples :
( CAT - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BAR _ / usr / local / m@@ bro@@ la / m@@ bro@@ w / usr / local / m@@ bro@@ la / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 - / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav
all parts of the command must be written in a line . option data will be switched on as default .
the voice edition of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further voice service , which provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various language output systems .
since the setup of the sleeve only takes place in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you will need to use only kt@@ ts@@ d as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth .
to setting the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service , which is installed in the setup dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; if K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; you need a language generator ( and naturally &amp; k@@ de ; 3.x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for the voice generator ) , but it depends on your computer and configuration .

&amp; kt@@ ts ; - the language output system of &amp; k@@ de ; - is one of modules existing service that allows any application to read text about the &amp; D@@ bus ; -@@ interface .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; is a partial control system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common use interface for &amp; k@@ de ; programmer ready to be equipped with T@@ TS skills . users also offers interesting options .
reading texts ( or parts thereof ) in text editor &amp; Kate ; also when &amp; Kate ; is embedded in other &amp; cold ; applications .
the language edition is carried out via the program in @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher , the various background program such as the peak , festival , &amp; etc ;
enables the creation of language editions to the command line ( or with Shell scripts ) about the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; support program .
Z@@ U@@ K@@ UN@@ FT : support for Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up languages like Vo@@ ice@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Meta @-@ language ( SM@@ ML ) .

in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de.@@ org / ) you can subscribe to the list of ht@@ t@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de.@@ org / mail@@ man / list@@ info / k@@ de @-@ Acc@@ essi@@ bility . the developers can also be found in the I@@ RC ( ir@@ c.@@ k@@ de.@@ org , Channel # k@@ de @-@ Acc@@ essi@@ bility ) .
before you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; you must install program @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher and set right . see also
during the first start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as there are no speakers , the cartridge card will be displayed . see also if you have at least one speaker , the map is displayed General . see .
most T@@ TS syn@@ thesizer offer various languages and voices , so also different versions of language , syn@@ thesizer , voice , gender , volume and speed is considered as speaker . you should use at least one speaker , before you use &amp; kt@@ ts , since the program speed disp@@ at@@ cher is used otherwise the standard driver .
several speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable to several pressure expectations for the same printer .
if you click on the card reader speakers in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the board of the card is indicated . it will also automatically start when you start the ts@@ m@@ gr , and it is still not a speaker .
all of the speakers are appearing in this list . the preferred speakers will appear on the list . the top speaker is used for voice output if an application does not exist .
in a mouse click a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
in a mouse click a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
in a mouse click a speaker from the list , and click on this button in order to push the speaker in the list one line further . the order of the speaker in the list is also its priority .
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ts ; -@@ system .
choose a tuning type of tun@@ es , there are three male and three female voices as well as a jun@@ ks and maid service to choose from .
when you click here , the new spokes@@ person appears on the ant@@ it@@ ch Card speaker . to change the settings of this speaker , click on Edit menu .
now you can use &amp; rec@@ ts . go back to the map and check if voice output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is crossed , so the T@@ TS service of &amp; k@@ de . see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts . please click on the map card to create text orders and manage . see .
if you have at least one speaker , you can start the output system by &amp; k@@ de ; click on the map series General to open this card card . here you can set some general options .
check out this check box to activate the &amp; kt@@ ts ; this start successfully , the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is successful , and you can create text orders and read it . see . remove the marking , will keep K@@ TT@@ SD and the T@@ TS System by &amp; k@@ de ; disabled .
if kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is terminated , continues &amp; rec@@ ts , if the field of language output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
if this check box is marked and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will automatically appear when reading the control system , dis@@ appears once the pre @-@ read is complete .
with the buttons in this series you can start text orders , break , stop and take up again .
with the buttons in this series you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; open cli@@ p@@ board or open a text file to open . you can also change the speaker for a job .
click on the user or OK , then all changed settings on all sides are taken over .
the card orders will only be displayed if K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the F@@ TT@@ SD card reader and cross the language course there ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed website . then check the text that should be read , and select in the main menu Tools text . after a short time the language version should start .
it is almost always useful to select the desired text of a web page . you can also ski@@ p this step , but then you will also read many &amp; HTML ; presentations and other invisible brands also read .
in &amp; Kate ; the expanded text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; you can read the text displayed . first , check if &amp; kt@@ ts ; runs at first , and select the text , which should be read , and select in the main menu Tools text . then the language version should start .
this also works if &amp; Kate ; embedded in other applications like &amp; eg ; in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Quant@@ a ;
K@@ Noti@@ fy is the news system of &amp; k@@ de ; which you can notify you of the notified events . you can read the text of this news even by &amp; kt@@ ts .
in &amp; conversation ; , the I@@ RC programme of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can send various kinds of messages when you get informed when you get informed by a I@@ RC channel , in which your nick@@ name arrives . with &amp; kt@@ ts , you can then read the I@@ RC message text .
supports a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program K@@ Noti@@ fy , is a menu entry noti@@ fications in the Settings menu . download the settings here for K@@ Noti@@ fy , depending on the application .
filter for character strings offer a good opportunity to correct or mis@@ er@@ ated messages . the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which has been sent to the delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts , is a good example . you remove the tags b@@ r and b out of the news , the email address , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , since it can be accepted as required in most cases .
filter are one of the advanced skills of &amp; kt@@ ts ; . for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not necessary .
in filters , text is processed until it is sent to program in @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . you are useful for improving the language to replace wrong spoken words or ab@@ brevi@@ ations , to select a matching language and speaker to avoid certain short@@ com@@ ings of language synthesis and their voices .
to understand the work of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; work with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts : distingu@@ ishes four types of texts .
the edition of Screen editing has the highest priority . it will be presented to all other orders and will keep these orders . if the edition of the Screen Reader is read , the orders will be resum@@ ed again .
warning is the next priority . this level is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor is going to be hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will be resum@@ ed after the issu@@ ing of the warning .
News have the next big priority . a message sub@@ breaks off normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example for an application that is news . while you can welcome you with &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone welcome you to enter the room . &amp; k@@ de ; messages are also news . read it .
the rest are simple text orders . each order to use the card orders is a text order . KS@@ ay@@ it is an example of applications that uses the text orders . text orders are intended for the issue extended texts that have no particular attention .
all four orders are processed in qu@@ eu@@ e long , with the exception of the edition of Screen editing . if an application is sending a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just a such reading will keep this issue and finished .
first you need to know that filters will never be applied to the output of screen realis@@ ing . they are used on normal war@@ nings , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ messages .
filter process the text and forward it to the next filter . at present there are three types of filters .
filter is implemented as modules . in the future there is still further types of filters .
replacement parts replace parts of a text by other text . the parts can be delivered either as words or as regular expres@@ sions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; is provided with pre@@ defined character strings such as : - ) by text or for the conversion of messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understanding form .
&amp; XML ; trans@@ duc@@ er use a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format into a different format . included in delivery of &amp; X@@ HTML ; are some X@@ SL@@ T files to translation &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML .
you can send orders depending on the text of the text or on the program , sent to a speaker . if you have sent a female voice , you can read the text by K@@ DE News about it for example . Si@@ eh@@ e can read about it .
each of these different filter has adjustable rules , according to which he is used for voice output . if the filter appears that its rules is not applicable , he gives the text unchanged at the next filter .
when a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; notification shall be sent , it will be processed by all activated filters , which have been established on the side down below . the processing of filters are made in the order from top to bottom .
this shows the list of normal scale filters . if a filter does not cross it , it is not activated and is not used . filters are set up from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . choose the type of filter , and it will be shown below the following layout di@@ alog@@ s .
for the setup of string orchestra filters you need to enter a list of words or regular expres@@ sions as a comparison sample . these patterns will be replaced in the text , then the text will not be replaced against the associated replacement text .
enter your name for your filter . this name can choose to choose any number , it must be different from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expres@@ sions . the filter compar@@ es the text with character strings in the column match and replace it in accordance with the string drawing from the column . the list is processed in the displayed order from above .
click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list .
with these buttons , you can download a list of words or regular expres@@ sions from a file that store up or delete the current list . download a list from a file that sets the entries from the file to the existing list .
here a language is registered here , if the speaker is only used for the text order one of the listed languages . click on the button to show a list of languages . you can also hold multiple languages if you press the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ button pressed .
if a value is registered here , the filter is used only if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can set several programs separately through coma . example : conversation , k@@ mail
use the q@@ d@@ bus program using the q@@ d@@ bus program ; the &amp; D@@ bus ; numbers must be we@@ aving . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the user ID copy @-@ 34@@ 32 allows you to enter only .
the string bag filters will only be applied to the text when all conditions with one entry in the box of a box filter . if all input fields is empty , the filter will be applied to all the texts .
when comparing words , the regulatory filters of regular expres@@ sions in the form \ \ s word \ \ .. The words must therefore be limited on both sides by divi@@ den@@ signs ( spaces ) .
in this manual , you will find no instructions on the writing of regular expres@@ sions . if you have installed the &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expres@@ sions installed , you can use it in the di@@ alog@@ s . &amp; # 160 ; edition &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expres@@ sions can be found in the package .
&amp; XML ; trans@@ duc@@ ers translate &amp; XML ; using X@@ SL@@ T files from one format into another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3C Standard for such converting XML . however , it can only be installed on your system .
specify the path to the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c can be reached via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H , also x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is enough .
with the intercom switching filter you can send texts to a specific speaker , which is set up on the card one speaker , or to a speaker with certain properties . you can define that texts by mail of a female voice are to be read . see .
before you can add a text to the filter , it is looking for a speaker for the text . the speaker is based on the speaker system that sends the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; send the characteristics of the speaker &apos;s speaker . with the speaker switching filter you can over@@ write the chosen speakers .
here is a value available here , if the text contains the entered regular expression . is installed on your system of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expres@@ sions can be applied to the button to get the help with the input .
to achieve faster processing , you should try to anchor off the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
place here the features of your desired microphone station . if the text meets the above @-@ shown filter conditions , the speaker is selected to display the desired requirements at the easiest way . click on the button to indicate the dialog box selection .
use these buttons to save or download or delete all settings .
the intercom switching filter will only be applied to the text when all conditions with one entry in the box of This filter is apply if applicable . you must notify at least one condition .
the speech @-@ API , by &amp; k@@ de ; to give thanks to the programmer its applications T@@ TS skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; D@@ Bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , which can be added to K@@ TT@@ SD with syn@@ thesizer ; so it can use syn@@ thesizer .
the following section includes a short description of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ bus ; interface of language output API from &amp; k@@ de ; . the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is will be found on the k@@ de ; Acc@@ essi@@ bility web@@ page ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / Cam@@ bil@@ it@@ y.@@ k@@ de.@@ org ) .

none of the mentioned speech syn@@ thesizer supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ slip filter list , but when using the module for festival pages are not read in .
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta you need to install ( male British ) Voice Rab _ di@@ phone , so that you don &apos;t want to do this voice if you &apos;re not able to read this voice . make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found on the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H .
certain characters or interest characters seem to cause error when syn@@ thes@@ izers , so that all propositions are printed or only cow@@ ardi@@ ans . what can I do against it ?
first , make sure the encoding of the encoding is set to the appropriate value for the appropriate language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , this may be fixed by a string cassette filter . see .

KT@@ TS works with any language syn@@ thesizer which can be launched at the command line in a &amp; console .
the list of the af@@ ore@@ mentioned languages can be incomplete or ob@@ sol@@ ete . therefore , take the description of syn@@ thesizer to the supported languages . see also on the website of kt@@ ts , according to information that are not included in this manual .
the program &quot; &quot; @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; uses an adap@@ tive module architecture for voice syn@@ thes@@ izers . if you would like to expand &amp; kt@@ ts ; for use of another Syn@@ thes@@ izers , use the developer team in connection .
the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; -@@ conversion filter is not necessarily necessary . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c using the ap@@ t @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
to comp@@ ile &amp; compiled ; you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or higher ) including the par@@ c@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the program &quot; non @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot;
if you select the source codes by &amp; kt@@ ts ; select from the source repository for k@@ de@@ crimin@@ alizes or install any night currently created Tar@@ ball , and install the program with the following commands :
before you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; first , check first if a @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher works correctly with your language syn@@ thesizer . you can use the Sh@@ ell@@ skri@@ pt SPD @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ops ; the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr should be developed so that the device of @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher is set directly and the script SPD @-@ conf is no longer required .
a long text is dismant@@ led in single sets . the user may withdraw or retri@@ eve a few sentences in single sets , repeat the output or break down .
if an application text on &amp; kt@@ ts , you can specify a female speaker for the issue . if you have a speaker set up , whose language is English and its sex is female , otherwise it will automatically choose the best matching speaker . if you want to learn more about it , like &amp; kt@@ ts ; a speaker is chosen to see you in .
when you click on the map speaker , add a speaker to the list or click on Edit , the cartridge card is shown . as an example , the device of the Module is shown for Festival Interactive . details of the modules can be found among the modules .
enter the path for detailed festival program . when the Path to Festival is included in P@@ AT@@ H , you &apos;ll have to enter the festival .
choose the character encoding for text which is handed over to festival . for voices , the &amp; kt@@ ts ; this setting is automatically done so that Western languages ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 is used to use Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ ders , set volume , speaking speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you can &apos;t select a few regulator , and do not display this gray voice , the chosen voice will not be able to vote these settings .
some votes such as Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices will require several seconds due to their size . if you select this check box , these voices will already be loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so that ( with greater memory consumption ) the first set is syn@@ thes@@ ized .
if this check box cannot be selected , you don &apos;t have any spokes@@ person ( or forgot to click on the user ) .
if this check box is marked with the start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr the program window will be visible . otherwise , the icon window will be visible , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window .
if this check box is marked and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is not running out , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD will read a text . this allows you to read or control the possibility to read or anywhere else .
here all orders placed in the waiting period , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of propositions and the straight set . the speaker @-@ ID corresponds to the column ID on the card nar@@ rator .
with the buttons in this series you can choose a full @-@ trip in the order which is selected in the list below . ( but not each order consists of several sets ) .
with one click on OK all changes of settings ( even on the other cards ) are taken over and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will be reduced to the icon in the system section . then click on this icon to view the program window .
if the sound system &amp; &apos;s ; not installed , but instead of AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the map card audio . see also .
here only text orders are listed and managed . issues of Screen editing , war@@ nings and messages are not displayed . more information about the news types of &amp; kt@@ ts are available .
choose the type of audio output . if a component is not selected , it has been compiled &amp; used ; either without support for the appropriate audio module , or kt@@ ops ; cannot load the necessary libraries .
if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de should be used for the audio output , select here the audio output . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you have to install at least one module . if you have chosen AL@@ SA , select the PCM device here . see also
set the speaker speed here . 50@@ n@@ bsp ; % corresponds to about half and 200@@ n@@ bsp ; % about double normal speaking speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program does not have to install SO@@ X .
click on the user to take the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ts ; -@@ system .
the list of AL@@ SA tools includes all PCM devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you &apos;ll need to figure out what device can work with you . in doubt , choose Standard .
on this map card you can set special actions which will always be executed if the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ops ; processed four types of language orders :
the edition of Screen editing has the highest priority . it will be drawn to all other orders and stops these orders . after the edition of the Screen Reader was read , the orders will be resum@@ ed again .
warning is the next priority . this level is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor is going to be hot . a warning will keep the output of messages and normal text . these orders will be resum@@ ed after the warning of the warning .
News have the next priority . a message sub@@ breaks off normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks news . if you can read &amp; eg ; just leave a long text on a web page , you can welcome you with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone welcome you who is just entering the room .
when a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen reader , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output in the maintenance long .
this audio file will always be played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both gli@@ ding sound is checked , the introductory sound is played before the introductory message .
the settings on this map boards apply only for normal text orders . for news , war@@ nings and the issues of Screen editing , there are no special actions when they are interrupted by a message with higher priority .
to start with &amp; kt@@ ts ; K@@ note messages are pre @-@ read , launch kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and click noti@@ fications . the noti@@ fications should appear .
mark this check box to switch to read &amp; k@@ de ; dis@@ appoint@@ ments . if this setting is not marked , the remaining settings are de@@ activated and rec@@ ti@@ bles ; reads no al@@ erts .
if this setting is marked , al@@ erts , where a sound is played , by &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read .
use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . if you click on the button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message before , the &amp; conversation ; ma@@ iled when someone mentioned your nick@@ name in a I@@ RC message .
all events that are otherwise stated in the list is igno@@ red by &amp; kt@@ ts .
use this selection field to define what &amp; kt@@ ts ; do if an event is coming . you have the following selection possibilities :
if you select user defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholder :
you can enter here the features of the desired microphone station . standard cho@@ oses the speaker that will be shown as the top record in list on the list of boxes .
note that there are three levels for events . is specified for a certain event of a specific application , this is executed . otherwise , the action will run for all other events of the specific application . as the last way , the action is set up , which was specified below standard ( all other events ) .
the event All al@@ erts for the Application Standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . you can define the al@@ erts as follows :
use the button Save to store the settings for the al@@ erts in a file . if you want to start the stored settings from a file . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except all dis@@ agreements are deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3C @-@ Standard to mark text for a language output . this standard includes brands for controlling the voice of voices , volume , volume , gender , and pitch . SS@@ ML is part of the Vo@@ ice@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3C standard .
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML are only partially available and only in the basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you have to install the Rab _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) since it is the standard voice that uses the festival in the SS@@ ML edition .
if the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog does not be adjusted to 100@@ n@@ bsp ; SS@@ ML is usually spoken very mon@@ ot@@ on .
&lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; &lt; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UTF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; Who has slept in my bed ? asked my bear . who has slept in my bed ? asked my bear . who has slept in my bed ? asked the Bär@@ bel . &#93; &#93; &gt;
there are two types of filters - normal filters and pun@@ c@@ lim@@ iting filters ( SD@@ B filter ) . this allows you to start &amp; ski@@ p faster with the presentation , as only the first set must be syn@@ thes@@ ised , not the whole text order . so you can also ski@@ p or ski@@ p forward and break even if the language syn@@ thesizer is not directly supported .
here you can see the pro@@ positi@@ onal detection filter . when the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts , it is automatically set up as a set of pro@@ positi@@ onal detection filter . you can change its settings or modify other Sat@@ is@@ it@@ iner@@ tia filters , but not recommended .
in the easiest way to try out the device selection by selecting : switch on the card selection , which drives &amp; kt@@ ts ; switch on the card selection again , change some features and check how the selection of the microphone has changed . to , of course you have to have more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is inv@@ alid .
&amp; kt@@ ts , then faster with the fore@@ head can begin , as the first set must be processed , and not the whole text block , which can be very long .
you can then stop text orders on the map ticket orders , even if the language syn@@ thesizer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal proposition characteristic filter is automatically set up when you run kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be removed only . do not change anything at this filter , unless you know what you do .
to compare text with a regular expression for sat@@ z@@ end and add a tab@@ ul@@ ators ( Dec@@ imal code 8 ) to Sat@@ ten@@ sions ( Tab@@ ul@@ ural code 8 ) . note that the standard Sat@@ is@@ it@@ iner@@ ary filters will keep the character set .
S@@ BD Filter can never be applied to &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News ( k@@ is@@ ers ) , war@@ nings , messages or output of screen reproduction .
if you are removed from expl@@ oring the normal sat@@ er@@ aser filters , you can re@@ insert this again by using the file standard _ sb@@ dr@@ c .
on the card interface selection , you can over@@ write the speaker settings for the application . the card ticket is displayed if
use of the standard speaker ( the top on the board ) . with other words , there are no microphone properties specified .
using the appropriate speaker , which shows all the features of a set speaker . if you do not delete or edit the settings of the microphone . otherwise select &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker , which was originally selected to the originally set properties .
select the method for entering the desired microphone features by clicking on one of the select buttons .
select here the features of the desired microphone station . if this property doesn &apos;t matter , don &apos;t give it any matter .
check out this check box when the property should have priority before other features . you can also use multiple markings here .
since the language is a critical factor when there is a critical factor . you will always use this feature . the only case you might want to specify the attri@@ bute language , if you may know that a specific application will be sent in another language than that in the working environment .

I have an additional voice for the festival from the internet . I installed it and can &apos;t use them in festival , but kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr does not show this voice .
in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / festi@@ val@@ int / Vo@@ ices added the new voice . as a guide you can serve the other entries . if that is successful , please send a patch together with the &amp; URL ; in which you have found the voice to the developers .
on the card audio there is a setting speed . that this works , the program has to be installed and in@@ active about the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . some syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ i module such as Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed . depending on the chosen voice , it is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the talk speed will be igno@@ red when &amp; kt@@ ops ; &amp; HTML ; ( this is that the HTML in SS@@ ML will be controlled . ) De@@ activate either the filter for the transformation of &amp; HTML ; according to &amp; XML ; ( see ) or if you are quite bra@@ ve , change the .x@@ sl file of &amp; HTML ; -@@ to @-@ SS@@ ML @-@ transfer@@ ring filter , and set the talk speed up .

the following modules for voice syn@@ thesizer will be created by default . some of them have a runtime depen@@ dency of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free according to the Guidel@@ ines of Deb@@ ian @-@ Distribution ) . the column settings option to switch the setting button shows the pass parameters which causes the over@@ flow of the setting .
as default , it is installed and installed in / op@@ t / k@@ de@@ 3 . if this folder is not specified in the ambient variable $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS , you need to specify the --@@ pre@@ fix = destination .

before you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; first , check first if your language syn@@ thesizer works correctly . follow the instructions that you have received with syn@@ thesizer .
Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thesizer whose source code is open . the quality of the votes is generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported . with many voices you can adjust volume , speaking speed and pitch .
you need to install at least one language . help you find in the instructions which are supplied with festival . would you like to read websites ( male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone .
for these voices , you need to comp@@ ile an additional module , therefore you need the source code of the festival . the German voices will be subject to limits when passing .
this voice sets Festival 1.@@ 95 beta or later . the voice is still in one early stage development . un@@ pack the software in festival / lib / Vo@@ ices / Russian / . if you enter the Russian votes , you must choose a k@@ yr@@ illi@@ c ( 8 @-@ bit ) encoding as for example CO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux ; distri@@ butions . look for Festival as first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech language , the encoding must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding must be set to an 8 @-@ bit c@@ yr@@ illi@@ c such as CO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
the festival can be used together with the &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; syn@@ thesizer . then the festival takes over the le@@ x@@ ic@@ ality analysis and &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; it generates the audio output . the &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; program and &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; a complete voice output system is . &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; generated language from Di@@ ph@@ on files . you need additional software to create this di@@ phone .

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center , which allows management of network interfaces , routine and DNS settings .
the &amp; contro@@ l@@ center ; allows users to manage a number of system and desktop settings on a single , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting from K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; net@@ work@@ conf ; package has been developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; create the areas of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple surface for the user :
after installation , a new module network settings are displayed in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be launched by a selection of k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; network networking settings in &amp; menu .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware is not installed . physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured , thus &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device is at all and allows setting the network properties .
in most cases device drivers for the network hardware and other devices are installed and installed . devices later added , the drivers must be added later , according to the kernel version , the drivers must be loaded according to the kernel version :
the module network settings is loaded when selecting network settings in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index is selected . when starting the module network settings this system is attemp@@ ting to detect the system platform automatically .
if the platform cannot be recognized , the hanging choice is offered . it is the platform from the list , which the distribution and the release of the best way . by marking the setting of non @-@ re @-@ questions the setup can be performed permanently . when next Start of network settings , this selection will then be pre@@ set automatically .
changing the network settings are possible only in system management mode . in advance , all options are displayed grey , which means the settings can only be viewed . in the system management mode , it is necessary to enter the system management mode at the right bottom end of the module . it is necessary to enter the password .
in the system management mode , the total functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three riders :
the rider network interfaces serves to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . from the rider network interfaces you can perform the following tasks :
the Settings menu can be provided through selecting the required device in the list and click of the button to set up in the dialog box .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . clicking the button extended settings shows the dialog with further options .
the selection provides the TCP / IP settings from a DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP servers . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP information is transmitted at any system start , therefore no further setting is required . in the selection list may either be selected either DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , according to the system .
the selection of Manu@@ ally can be set to the TCP / IP address without DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the input field IP address , the required TCP / IP address is required .
if this setting is marked , the system initi@@ alized the network interface for boats . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated .
the values in this dialog are displayed as the characteristics of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address will not be used in the network . enter an already existing IP address would result in one TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; console ; you can determine whether the address is already used in use . in doubt the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched off depending on your needs . turn @-@ off of a switched network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ....
network devices can be activated or switched off depending on your needs . activ@@ ating a activated network device is provided by selecting from the list and clicking on interface ....
the IP address of the host is fixed in the local sub@@ net , which convey@@ s the physical connection to remote network networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ nets .
if the computer is more than a network interface , the interface must be selected in which the gateway is selected in which the gateway is selected .
a computer with DNS support replaces a full domain name through the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computer can only understand IP addresses . if the computer uses ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ in@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS uses this name to an IP address such as 12@@ 3.4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the calcul@@ ator for the name @-@ resolution part of the rider name resolution allows easy managing this list . entries can be added , removed or changed . DNS entries can be ordered through selection of a paper and up or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list with the buttons or down in the priority .
Adding the button to add ... from the group calcul@@ ator to the name resolution you can add a DNS server . the dialog box will add the New Nam@@ es@@ erv@@ er dialog .
first you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the button Add . the entry will then be inserted in the list .
from the group calcul@@ ator to the name resolution you choose one entry and then click on the button .... It will show the dialog box .
the list of well @-@ known computers describes calcul@@ ator @-@ to @-@ IP address for TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily for bo@@ oting when no DNS server are available . in small , closed network drives it can replace DNS server .
normally , the list nam@@ e@@ well contains some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IPv6 addresses support . this is still in the test of IP should replace in future version 4 .
enter the IP address of the well @-@ known computer and click Add .... The New Testament dialog will also be shown .
enter the name of the well @-@ known computer and add the button to add . if the well @-@ known machine has multiple known names , de Button add several times and enter the other alias names .
choose one entry of a well @-@ known computer from the list and select Edit .... The acquain@@ t@@ ance of calcul@@ ator will be displayed .
it may be executed one of the following tasks , then the list of static hosts will be updated .
the settings used in the module network settings are not effective immediately in the system . in order to activate changes , the following command must be removed .
the homepage from &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for the installation of the binary distri@@ butions ( mostly rpm packages ) , it is enough , if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the ready @-@ compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is simply to download the rpm package and in one &amp; console ; with rpm such as follows :
alternatively a tool can be used with graphical user such as a package or the installation tool of its distribution .
for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; not , but additionally , development packages with libraries and others are needed .
this is recommended only experienced users . however , it is not difficult to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should make this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technologies are given , in the second all by &amp; net@@ work@@ conf ; changeable configuration files will be discussed .
this area can &apos;t replace more information about IP networks . in this section , only basic information about the integration of the PC is convey@@ ed into a small ( home ) network .
at present , IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IPv4 ) . IPv4 is expected that it is expected to continue in the near future . this description focuses on the widespread IPv4 .
one of the most important information is the knowledge to as@@ sign the IP address of a network interface , at the &amp; eg ; workplace is the network administ@@ rators , which can be used for a valid IP address , or if available , the IP address can &apos;t be chosen as desired .
when setting up a own small ( home ) network the IP address should be selected for this purpose reserved to avoid IP address cont@@ acting with the global ( Internet ) network . addresses from the table below are not for@@ warded in the Internet , therefore its arbitr@@ ary use is possible .
of course , access to the Internet can be used for such machines through setting up a gate .
for smaller networks mostly addresses in the range from 192.168.@@ 1.1 to 192.168.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set on 255.@@ 255.@@ 25@@ 5.0 so that all computers are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .0.0 and 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own calcul@@ ator ) . the standard route is required for the IP address .
the address 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 is reserved for the IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 is assigned to an own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle .
in this part , the configuration files created by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf are affected and where they are stored in different distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes modified in DSL connections , so it doesn &apos;t be surprised if in the event of active DSL connections a different content as defined there is .
for &amp; SuSE ; is known that this file is sorted by scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config file . another Status as expected can be found .

&amp; k@@ dat ; is a back@@ ing program for tape drives on the basis of t@@ ar . it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape . the second purpose was the answer to a question that my wife was asked : how much longer it takes it when it sec@@ ures ?
before a band can be used , it must be used by &amp; k@@ dat ; this may be done in three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; does the band returns and read the for@@ ging information of the tape . recogni@@ zes &amp; k@@ dat ; the gu@@ ing of the band does not know if the band is being format@@ ted .
recognize &amp; k@@ dat ; the pro@@ claim , looking for the appropriate index on your record . can this not be found , you will be asked if the band@@ index is to be created .
if everything goes smooth , the icon changes for the tape drive to indicate that the band has been mounted . in the status bar there is a good news . the volume of the tape can now be searched for the band .
prior to throw the tape , first the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to do this :
and , in fact , there is a modification of the symbol for the band that the integration of the band has been solved and shows an appropriate message in the status bar . the band can now be dis@@ car@@ ded without risk .
before a volume of &amp; b@@ dat can be used , it must be format@@ ted by &amp; dat .
a tape cards must be format@@ ted before you can be used for saving data . this process does not need to be format@@ ted before using the form of &amp; k@@ dat ; this process should not be format@@ ted before using the tape of &amp; k@@ dat . flo@@ ppy disk drives usually have to be format@@ ted . flo@@ ppy disk drives are usually not necessary , but D@@ AT drives are not necessary .
after entering the band@@ name and the capacity goes &amp; k@@ dat ; with the form@@ ating of the tape . all data on the tape go lost ! after completion of the process , the band is automatically bound and is ready to use .
before you encounter the backup process , you must select the backup files , that can be done in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . it will be backed up to file or folders .
mark a security profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile .
select files in a local file tree with a bun@@ ch . only the selected files and / or sub @-@ folders will be secured .
click with the right mouse button on the local file tree and select in the menu ...
as soon as the f@@ use was initiated , the dialog box dialog for backup . in this dialogue , you can also check the selected files and change the settings for backup .
if you have confirmed the settings , the dialog appears secure . the dialog displays the progress of the backup process including data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archives on the drive . it will only be checked with the selected file or folders .
select the files in one of the archives on the entry for the band with a bun@@ ch . only the selected files and / or sub @-@ folders are checked .
click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry .
as soon as the test procedure was started , the dialog appears for checking . in this dialogue , you can check your selection once and change the folder for review .
if you confirm the settings for the review , the dialog appears . this dialog displays the progress of the progress process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
before you can re@@ build the re@@ build , the files must be restored , marked in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives that are among the entry for the tape drive . it will only be the selected file or sub@@ folder .
select the desired files from one of the archives with a bun@@ ny . only the selected files and / or sub @-@ folders are recovered .
click with the right mouse button on a file or folder in one of the archives and select in the menu Rest@@ ore ....
as soon as the recovery procedure was started , the dialog appears for restoration . in this dialogue , you can check once your selection and change the working folders for rest@@ oring .
if you have confirmed the settings for restoration , the dialog appears to restore . this dialog displays the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
sometimes it shows itself as necessary to create the Band@@ width file based on the belt content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can create the index on two ways :
this creates a safe profile with just selected files and default settings . you can set the following settings for a security profile :
the current folder , in which the backup is to be done . the list of converting files will be automatically updated according to the selected file folder .
for all files that are listed under backup files , only the files are secured that are located on the same file system , like the folder . folder that can be on other file systems , can be viewed separately from the backup files . each entry is considered t@@ ar independent of the other file system .
perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup file , a snap@@ shot file is secured . only the files you have changed since then .
the name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup is used .
del@@ etes the snap@@ shot file before the call of t@@ ar . this causes that all files will be secured and a new snap@@ shot file for the next backup will be created .
the functionality of buttons files &amp; gt ; and ; and lt ; files were not completely implemented at the time of compilation of this documentation .
the settings can be setup via the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . the following settings can be set :
the complete path to the device file for tape drives ( normally / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ com@@ ic variant of the tape device .
this setting is active , sent &amp; k@@ dat ; before the band is tied to the drive . with some drives it is necessary to run before read or write operations .
the option is switched on , tries &amp; k@@ dat ; to lock the outlet with tape drive . perhaps this setting does not work on all tape drives .
if the option is switched on , the del@@ etes of the integration of &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically dis@@ closure the band . do not use this option on Flo@@ ppy Stre@@ am@@ ers .
if the option is switched on , tries &amp; k@@ dat ; not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you must &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the block size for your tape drives .
if &amp; dat ; a tape is format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the band . this file should display only one memory block on the tape . the contents of the file is composed as follows :
( n byte ) The volume @-@ ID . the format of this string is us@@ ername : seconds , where hosts is the full name of the system , which has been format@@ ted on the tape . seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the era has been format@@ ted in which the band has been format@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file named in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat file .
the remaining files on the tape are pure t@@ ar archives that can be administ@@ er directly with &amp; GNU ; - t@@ ar . even other t@@ ar versions should work as long as it is not an incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a safety tape . this symbol is only active if a band is mounted .
&amp; ks@@ and@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer for system protocols . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users , where you can obtain information on your system or where the system allows you to obtain information about your system or install system log ; experienced users with fast access to the example of information about problems that occur on their server .
&amp; ks@@ and@@ log ; helps users to understand what your computer makes in the background . the task of &amp; ks@@ ecos@@ log ; is a simplified presentation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users , which can &apos;t know where you can obtain information on your system or where the system is deposited to different protocol files .
furthermore , ks@@ and@@ log ; experienced users allow quick access to the example of information about problems which occur on their server . &amp; ks@@ and@@ log ; attempts to provide some expanded functionality , using the protocol files to be filtered and evaluated .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 , &amp; ks@@ and@@ log , has a number of useful features . among others include :
support for many different types of log files , for format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other features are also included and will be explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you see in the following screenshot , select &amp; ks@@ using log ; functions available , with their help the individual protocol lines of a protocol file easily filters and sort them . the individual options for sor@@ ting and filters will be shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the start try &amp; ks@@ using log ; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocol has started . it will not be displayed under Linux normally in the folder / var / log , for the normal user does not have any permission to read .
you can also use the filter bar to filters according to a limited range of crit@@ erion or according to the selected filters . in the default setting , the list box contains only displayed next to the filter . in the default setting , a protocol line is displayed only if in one of the columns the character string of the filter search term is included .
you can also choose one another record at this point . select the column process for example in the protocol file protocol , and then apply to the name of a process , so it shows you &amp; ks@@ using log ; all protocol lines , which have been sent or created from this process .
this option is activated in the default setting and helps you to recogn@@ ise the important protocol lines . protocol lines of level error are displayed with a remarkable color as a protocol lines of level indication . the colored representation of protocol lines can be shut down .
if you want to display only certain process ( e.g. in the protocol protocol or at cr@@ on protocol ) , you can then be useful to examine the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process . this may then be useful if you want to check the output of a particular command as for example , using the Sam@@ ba server . in this case you will use filter bar .
in addition , you can jump the option to new lines in the context menu of the main window to show all new lines of date .
&amp; ks@@ and@@ log ; allows you to use multiple protocol files in separate sub @-@ windows . in order to open this function , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage . as soon as you selected a sub@@ window , select a protocol to display .
&amp; ks@@ and@@ log ; has a dedicated website to ht@@ t@@ p : / / ks@@ system log@@ .@@ forum @-@ sof@@ tw@@ are@@ .@@ or@@ g. D@@ ort you will find more recent information about the source of &amp; ks@@ ecos@@ log ; .
&amp; ks@@ using log ; can also be found in the following folder des &amp; k@@ de ; Subversion Archive : ks@@ and@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ archive
welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it editor , rather popular ( and the following is named ) as &amp; ks@@ ys@@ v ; this section leads a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; ks@@ ys@@ v .
the system V In@@ it is developed rapidly to control the program starts when running the system in the &amp; Linux ; world . therefore , because it is easier to use , more powerful and even more flexible than the traditional BSD @-@ In@@ it .
I will not go on historical aspects here ( amongst others , because I even don &apos;t know about it : - ) .
the in@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because someone might try to do a machine on system V in@@ it without creating a new installation and re@@ format@@ ted . the &amp; Linux ; kernel first will need to make sure that the old in@@ it was removed from there , if there was an option there .
the SY@@ SV In@@ it also diff@@ ers from the BSD In@@ it that there are configuration files in a sub @-@ folder of / etc . this folder name is called r@@ c.@@ d. there is r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and following further folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a lot of scripts . basically you need a script for any system service that would like to start at the High @-@ level system or change to another run@@ level ; , ht@@ t@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which will only be launched at once . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should lie between / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if it &apos;s not much use for this . you can also use a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run something like when you want to do with the serial port .
the kernel is searching for various positions after the program in@@ it and starts the first to find it .
the standard run@@ level is in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . you should see in the initial range as the following :
at this point you can take a look into the second column and probably notice the default level 3 is . if you want to change this , then you can upgrade / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab by hand and change the 3 . if you have something through it , then you will repair it by rest@@ oring the system and run the following :
but how do you start it all the right scripts ? if you enter in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , you probably see something like the following :
you will notice that in this folder you will find no right files . instead , each entry here is a link to any scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d .
how starts and stop in@@ it actually system services ? very simple : each of scripts is so written that there is an argument as start and stop . you can actually start the scripts in the following ways :
this would keep the ht@@ t@@ p@@ d server . it reads the name , and if it contains a K , the script will be called upon the argument . if it contains a S , the script will be called to the argument .
some people desire a simple way to create machines for many purposes . I might have &amp; eg ; a server running level , that can only run ht@@ t@@ p@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc ; it also could have a user lap level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc ; starts .
here you can learn the use of &amp; ks@@ ys@@ v ; you should not be very difficult because the program was such as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; ks@@ ys@@ v ; with a mouse or another poin@@ ter is easy to say tri@@ vial : simply drag one entry from the availability of availability to one of the six rounds to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can also change scripts between Run@@ lev@@ eling or change the position within a level by changing it . thereby , the entry of its original run@@ level ( or its position ) is removed . this happens if they go out an entry out of the available system services .
note : you will be post@@ pon@@ ed if you prefer to copy it into a new range . in order to select only on a new run@@ level , you need to insert copying from the menu menu or insert in the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the promotion .
the sor@@ ting number of an entry is sometimes not calculated . in such case you need to edit the sor@@ ting numbers of surrounding entries , before you can try to insert system service .
note : there is no possibility to recover entries in the paper basket . so be careful not .
you can use the tab button to activate the various working areas ( available system services , run@@ level 1 stop , run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) and cur@@ sor keys to make a selection above or below the previous .
to move one entry into another round level , move it into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it into the desired rounds level with insertion ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
in order to change the sor@@ ting number or the name of a single entry , press the tab button to change between different fields . do the tab button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to dis@@ card the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the menu file must be confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / ks@@ ys@@ v@@ r@@ c . pres@@ ets are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / config / ks@@ ys@@ v@@ r@@ c ) . otherwise it will be recovered from &amp; ks@@ ys@@ v ; recovered changes to the default settings are stored in a local ks@@ ys@@ v@@ r@@ c .
I have experim@@ ented with the Standard Run@@ es and now it starts to rest@@ art the machine . what can I do ?
enter the L@@ ILO -@@ Pro@@ m@@ pt lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in single @-@ use mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the standard run@@ off level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
I have some system services with &amp; ks@@ ys@@ v ; for execution filed under run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you are using &amp; SuSE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) , then you need to edit additional files in / etc , which are available only in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution .
the type of how system services are started in this distri@@ butions simpli@@ fies the configuration for propri@@ etary integration programs in this distri@@ butions , but is unfortunately no standard . the authors of &amp; ks@@ ys@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using another distribution , please check if all configuration files are required ( and whether they are in the right directory ) . some services ( like &amp; eg ; Apache or ht@@ t@@ p@@ d ) is easy without message when your configuration files are not available or false .
the importance of &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you are using a different distribution , please send information about the run@@ level so that this manual can be added to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the user and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; user .
after you have made changes , you have to save this . either use the appropriate symbol of the tool bar or the entry Save in the menu file .
&amp; user ; is an easy application . the main window consists of two card cards , the user and the user guide . for editing , select the desired users or the desired group with a double click on the entry . it appears the user or group characteristics .
some cards are only displayed if you have extended system settings . only if you are using advanced system settings . only if you can print custom settings . other cards appear when shadow @-@ pass@@ words , or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d like in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes are installed .
the card password appears if shadow -@@ pass@@ words , or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d installed like in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes .
this card card only appears if needed for at least one integrated fil@@ esystem ( quota ) and initi@@ alized ( recogni@@ z@@ able at the quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here you can change parameters for each user parameters :
these parameters can be set individually for each file system . the current file system is selected using the field of file system with position limitation
the map groups informs about the group height of the chosen user . the default group , to which the user belongs , will find in the field of Pri@@ m@@ onal Group . furthermore , the user can highlight in other groups by changing these in the large field .
the dialog features of the group contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or a group , select adding the user or group or click the appropriate button of tool@@ bar . editing or delete the selected user or the selected group works analog .
with this module you can install the L@@ ILO boot managers , remove the boot password , remove and change the time to boot from the standard operation system , remove the default system system , remove , modify , change and change more .
