<seg id="14">The specificity of & fsview; consists in, waxed file archies with the help of a so-called Tree Map graphically. each object is proportional to its size. this size must own the property that sum of the size of the orderly objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">At & fsview, the size of a file or folder, whereby the size of a folder is specified at the size of the file. in this way, large files can be easily detected, even though they can be easily detected at the folder hierarchy, so I can look at a graphical and interactive version of & UNIX and command.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & fsview; is an entry in the Treemap representation a rectangle, which represents a file or folder in your file system. to simpler navigation possess the rectangles of practical colour and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle, which is switched on display colour mode, may either be a depth for easy detection of the disappearance or representation of a different file, such as name, proprietors, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the different characteristics of the corresponding file or folder. for each feature you can define whether enough space is to be displayed, or whether the surface of subordinated rectangles is to be used, whereby the relative position can be determined by limitations during the sign of Treemap). in addition, you can define the relative position of the label in rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">During the installation algorithms for Treemaps should normally be kept that the surface is proportional to the size of the entry. at the Treemap in & fsview, this target will not always be available. note that less space for the frame is lost, if the rectangle is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">As the allocation of an entry was made for the subordinate entries, the implementation will be delivered. here, it is necessary for label and to avoid lack of space due to boxes that are possible to be square. the best methods in this respect are lines, columns or recursive second partition.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can set the minimum submitted area for an entry over the menu entry view. instead, a robber pattern on the area of the above ground is drawn, in order to indicate that this area should actually be achieved by an orderly entry.</seg>

<seg id="151">Perhaps you will be happy with this structure. holiday pictures can be found quickly across your storage location. if you are getting enough photos, then you will use subfolder as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc; then you can use a folder for pictures you can print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements like versioning of photos, archiving, work processes, constant supply of pictures to different themes and a large number of all. within 10 years 95% of archives and 5% working files will be created and you will not want to organize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes the stack-processing simple. separate new from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The split of original and workfiles simplifies a backup strategy and migration. they always know if you are looking for an original or a derived image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the metadata option to store metadata in & digial; this ensures that exif- and IPTC data will be written into the file. if you forget, then you can store the metadata from the database to files by clicking the corresponding item in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change what change? it creates & digious, a metadata editor available for a number of selected attribute. these are of course the most important.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now, the real work, as you need to select every photo words, labelling and an assessment. of course, you can select all the pictures, which will need the same attribute and then put the value. this makes sense, as you can concentrate on the best photos in the further work.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let us now call us with Keywords, keywords, how to proceed with other programs frequently, or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import the catalogs pictures from another source with built-in keywords, then the tree to insert and insert the images to the right spot. the sorrows of the hierarchy is no problem and can easily be done by pulling a subtree to another. the changed words will be updated by & fixings; updated throughout the trees.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graph shows how different metadata. this is a very large representation, since each block of metadata consists of many sections. date names and calendar data features of all pictures.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the words - the next section refers to labelling or comments, the third important tool to detect your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">They don't want to see most of your photos simply, you want to share them with your friends, your family, other photographers and agencies. they are sure to get how your photos arrive.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. from the distance is not even a nice beach panorama. if you consider it closer, then start to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I tell you this of the landing area of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy. Wow! one starts to dream, associations, the historical period is again present, you might even hear the silence. the label therefore has changed your perception of this panorama.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others who consider your photos look more important than the picture itself to create an interest. if you show images you should tell a story. remember, the key is it the meaning of the viewer to help Him that you move it and understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine if a picture is not perfect when it has the strength only with a label for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digious, you can save as much text in an internationalised Alphabet (UTF-8), when you export your images in Web-galleries, then these labels will be exported according to your wishes and / or the title of the Web-Galery system. you need to tell the story so for the opening act no second time.</seg>
<seg id="168">Do you remember the times before GPS? when you had to find out another city without navigation system? was it not a boring Planet before GoogleEarth? well, because with pictures departs the train of the spatial presentation now already with light speed.</seg>
<seg id="169">You can use the possibilities for the geolocalization. I'm sure that one day, in the near future, you can easily repeat your journeys by images using images. & digious, you can also export the pictures at the Recording. you can also export the pictures also to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; with Google Map view.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word game with copyright and describes the practice of use copyright to remove restrictions regarding the distribution and changing of copies. the same freedoms also apply in all versions, also for works of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you what information in set-up page of & fixings should be determined as information:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for writer and author): this field should add your name, or the name of the photographers, for example to protect the name of the photographer, then the name of a company or organization is not changed. after this value, it should not be changed once again. this field does not support Commas and Semikolons as a separator.</seg>
<seg id="173">Autortitel (Synonym for Writers): linked to the author. examples of this field contains the title number of photographers. examples of this field can be title like: employee photographer, professional photographer or independent commercial photographer. since this is a merk to the car field, this also must be completed.</seg>
<seg id="174">Editor (synonym for providers): use the possibility of creating the photo. if the photographer works for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press, this organisations cannot be listed here if the picture shows a storage photo, then the group / agency will be presented here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, although they have no protection against abuse. everyone who has no protection against abuse. this problem is able to delete or change the solution for this problem. for individuals, this is very important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and half-professionals this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is uniquely unique. & digious, in the near future, it will provide such a module for the pile-processing.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: turnkey, turnouts, power clamps, ECC, transmission errors, ageing of storage media, recovery, redundancy, desperation, life time, temperature, data size, widespread superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course, we don't talk about CDs on the road or a fire. this species of losses are the same which can also pass to you with traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section it is about problems with the so-called new media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll Ontrack, the largest data recovery company in the world, has some interesting statistics that has a data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">In order to combat the problem of CDs / DVDs that need to be trusted and you may not get more than a few years. of course you can buy them CDs and DVDs to archive and more expensive. there are offers of gold coated DVDs, & dollar; 2 the piece which is a lifetime of 100 years for itself. whether you believe it is in your discretion room.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD discs can be unreadable, but you can use this risk in which you use good discs and good capture, but they are not much more expensive than the cheapest way, but you are writing much reliable. it's worth the right to select.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very vulnerable for errors, even if you are just written only. therefore we use a control mechanism to protect themselves. 75% of the data are needed for formatting and control sums. despite this massive protection, they are using chemical ageing, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs, there is a reasonable program called IsoBuster. it runs under Windows and & Linux; however, it runs under Windows and & Linux; but there are also similar applications that corrupt data from damaged disks, disks, Flash media, USB drives etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray discs seem to capture the format war against the HD DVD. a dual-layer Blu-ray disc can save 50 GB, and thus nearly six times the capacity of a dual-player DVD with 8.5 GB. everything was said to have CDs and DVDs.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn up slowly with a good capture device to high quality media in a not proprietary format. read the media with a description, date & author character and thereafter to make sure the data on the next generation of media before using the last piece of hardware or software that can read this media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Disk manufacturers reserve your statistics for themselves. their manufacturers guarantee include a new disk, but not the data. Google provides on this topic a large field study on the fault mechanism of hard drives available: floppy disks</seg>
<seg id="187">In brief: disks hold the longest if you are run in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. some of SMART clincher can't notice this error. some of SMART specified errors will terminate the immediately impending attack. these are especially lesefehler and publishing counter. the expected lifetime period is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete losses due to overvoltage. of course, you can also backed up data loss due to any power if you have backed the files, but these losses can normally be recovered without major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electrical devices are not much, this may cause serious damage. on your machine, these anomalies can cause severe damage. on your computer, these anomalies may cause hardwarfare, destroyed motherboards and other defects. protect themselves before the inevitable loss for a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most widespread protection against current peaks is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that part of the energy reserves is absorbed and the rest. it is usually available in the form of a plug-bar. remember that any socket strip also contains an overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, then you should make sure that it satisfies the UL 1449 standard. this ensures a particular minimum of protection. you should also make sure that it protects your protection against lightning and thereby protects the properly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since an overvoltage can use each cable to your computer, you should also proof that all the peripherals which can be connected to your system. some manufacturers provide overvoltage applications that also include a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connectivity options for the coaxial cable of cable modems and the TV map.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, then you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are specifically designed for notebooks, therefore very small and you are also included to protect your modem. so you're ideal for travelling.</seg>
<seg id="194">While an overvoltage protection your system protects your system from smaller swings in the power lines it will not really help you. even a few seconds can lead to the loss of indispensable data. it can therefore be meaningful to invest in a uninterruptible power.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protection against overvoltages, these devices can automatically be able to store and drive the system. if you purchase a USV, you should make sure that they meet the same quality requirements as an overvoltage protection. furthermore, the life time of battery and the supplied software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and and compare the safety of current problems with the costs to avoid this. a high quality overload protection can be used for less than & euro; 40. this is only a small price difference if you think about your computer. finally, you should always remember all the cables before you go to the holiday.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple memory service. with the right configuration you can use it as a drive under & Linux; for Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use this as the backup destination for your software. Google Shared Storage is another popular offer that you can store any quantity of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">However, they are very expensive compared to the hard drives at home very expensive - 40 GB cost & dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & dollar; 500. furthermore, you must send the data about the comparatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important pictures. it is not a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution. it is too slow.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo-community 23hq.com will provide online storage services that are available on photos. the professional option will not provide you more in full resolution, in case of flickr more. for $25 a year you get unlimited storage that should be checked first in reality.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of data backup, the Web solutions are very secure. transmission errors are automatically adjusted by the TCP protocol and with the large companies it is included in the supply of backup and a simplified memory.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrate the elements of the transmission chain in the machine. all transfers are required for transmission errors. the filesystem and btrfs make at least the data integrity between the operating system and hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that nobody says when a transfer error occurred, not if this happened in your hardware. it is fairly disquieter that it should not happen in your computer. no one seems to have thought about it. no one seems to have thought about it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safe data route than that of your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are a further source of transmission losses, as they generate interferences in data streams. in normal file systems this error is unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are currently not especially affected by transfers problems you should look to the future. in 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS from Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates and can be upscale from two candidates. it is open source, with many patents and is available under one for the GPL incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it is also available for & Linux; and Windows is available. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has launched an own initiative with its btrfs system. this is still in alpha status. it uses the same protective mechanisms of the tender and is also available for & Linux; but it is not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Not underestimate that these two factors are responsible for 86% of data loss in notebook and 46% among workstations. at notebooks, the share of theft is 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less widespread than most. it leads to lower damage, such as theft or new installations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; there has been no more sighted.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less susceptible for data loss as proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to call the common file systems. a very good English articles can be found here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: false, only the speed of the investigation-process during an operation is higher and an undefined status is avoided. if a file is not completely saved before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the greatest threat to digital data: false, theft and human error are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are removed from fundamental physical limits 1-2 aperture settings of fundamental physical limits. this is a natural limit for these progress. sensitivity and sound characteristic for all types of light sensors are not far removed from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go towards the 10 megapixels sensors. even though this resolution have already been deteriorated for compact cameras and a high-quality optics are the optimum for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have a 10-12 megapixel resolution. for higher resolutions, you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">A 750GB hard disk drive you today for 100 & euro; so you do not have any other data loss for data loss. 6% of all PCs are often affected by any data loss. do not secure your data after a plan and test this backup before you make something like the reinstallation of your operating system, the exchange of plates or the size change of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Assuming your backups daily on an external SATA drive. if, then one day's flash, you're lucky if the drive wasn't connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A Desaster proposes locally and destroys a lot. forget airplane accidents: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous enough. they normally affect a whole room or the entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore disintegration always means a non-local storage. bring your backups up to the neighboring house, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of the physical separation: as above already said is a more common reason for data loss despite securing the panic. if you have a backup, which is not immediately available, then you can save one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Full backup: a complete backup of all files will be secured. this is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential securing: backup of the files have been changed since the last complete recovery. generate a complete moment of snapshot at two time points: the full backup and the last differential pressure.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of files that have been changed since the last backup. generate several snapshots. you can restore the original status to any time. this backup comes up to a versioning system next with the exception that it is only abgeted and not continuous.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily install on your machines. in contrast to script controlled FTP meetings or other types of file transmissions scripts, only the difference of files that have been changed. this is compressed and if you want to increase safety over ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Secure important images directly after you have saved on your computer to a DVD or another optical medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">This approach will provide you enough time to recover losses and again. at the same time you will have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly battle for at least one month and a moment of torque should be done manually after which you have made a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, stored in the image file stored IPTC information, original XMP files, original retain, storage, scalability, media, recovered of images and metadata, copy the images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization,..., use of the internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">With this valuable pictures can survive the next 40 years, that is about the period in which you are really interested in you because they are aware of your childhood or youth, there are two strategies to be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">Since the future is unpredictable, you have to consider and rate all this today. unfortunately, there is no other way to be exercised contrary to time. unfortunately, there is no other way to enact as a certain wax. if less variants you have used in the past, it is easier to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered using explanations in this document. use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is now available for everyone. if you have an old system that is important for reading your pictures, then store it and install it in a virtual machine for a later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the Council is quite simple: every time you can change your computer architecture, your storage and backing technology, or your file format should check your library and if necessary to a newer default. stay at open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the specialist pressure for the possibility to change a system in its size. this means always increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's go out of which you have the scalability with the scalability and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated record or partition. at * nix systems like & Linux; you can copy this section on a new record:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check the dmesg command whether your new record was recognized by the system, but do not hang it up.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dev / SDB [#] of = / dev / SDB, the new plate is / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; Size of the plate at MBgt; # works with ext2,3, FAT16, 32 and ReiserFS & dollar; resize2fs / dev / rc1 # change the size of rice FS if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if one day is no software that can read it, then you can create it itself. this task is easier by year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that disappears slowly from the market. you should therefore not use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG has been developed as an open source standard designed to replace GIF. it can save much more. it is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metals, 16 bits per color channel and full transparency. PNG is required relative to many administration information, but not as many as TIFF needs and a slow compression. this format, we recommend you to store your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as image format. TIFF can store images in high quality, but requires very large files. with some cameras you can save your images in this format. however, a problem is that this format has been adapted to many people. however, there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital Negative file format is a licensed and open raw format that has been developed by Adobe Systems. it is based on the TIFF / EP format and is obligated to use metadata. a handful camera manufacturers are now available and we hope to use the competitors from Canon and Nikon.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is possibly one of the reasons why to replace Adobe its XML-based XMP technology. XMP stands for & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. the file information are stored using the extension & quot; .xmpg; stored for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers pull it before a original of your intake, most often store in the tube format. however, it can come to problems with linking between the metadatendatei and the image file, and how above it will notice the raw format. therefore, you should use whether you use DNG as a container and put everything there together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization that support for fully compatible online metal communities, discussions and collaborative work in the DCMI communities and the DCMI work groups, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and clarified efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of metadatenstandards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Importing images from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as images are on the camera, you can use this as temporary fuse.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert tube files to DNG and save those in your shell archive. this function is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a fine-layer processing, you can use external programs. if you edit the pictures back with & fixings; then you should add the metadata again. these were cut under circumstances from the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the machined pictures for copyright with a digital watermark. export it only then in Webgaleries, encode in MPEG, use contact page, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digious, you can add a description as you can already have on your hard drive. however, the camera interface makes you many advanced settings for importing images to your album database.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digious camera; connect these with the calculator, turn the camera on display mode and switch to the screen. another description can be found in the handbook of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, this is attempting to connect to your camera. if the connection is made, a fertig -indicator at the bottom end and the preview can be displayed on the camera. if this is the case, the file names and a symbol for file access to any file, photos, movies, music etc. on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you may need to see the camera information about any entry. with the connected features and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the properties of one single or his metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog displays file properties and photo information to be saved internally by the camera. a symbol shows that the image has not yet been downloaded from your computer. note that some digital cameras does not have any information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The rider Metadata shows the internal metadata such as EXIF, manufacturer remarks, GPS etc. this information are the same as at the metadata side bar from the main window of & fixings; or the image processing. note that this metadata does not have some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on their computer is the click on the button and then download the selection of all. this invites all photos from their camera to a single album and we recommend you to check whether the pictures have been downloaded in an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you don't want to download all photos, you can select the required video options from & kde. once you have selected the photos, use the button to download and then selected below. the button is selected as long as you have chosen some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option is now available. these pictures were not yet selected yet. in this case, the new pictures are marked with a star in the front window. if you choose this option, only the new pictures are downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you are using the buttons, download or selected the buttons, a dialog appears where you can select the album. the list of existing albums is sorted, displayed as normal folder. details on folder you can select in section My albums. then select the album out of the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After you have selected the target album, press OK, and & digious; invites the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">As soon as you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete all of them from the camera. if you want to delete all of delete all. if you want to delete all, then you must select this first and delete them out.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there are no possibility to restore photos from the camera. you should not be deleted automatically if the photos are successful in a & digious; -album were downloaded, before you want to delete them from the camera. if you want to extinguish the camera control, you should make this much faster than that.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras use as filename for the photos frequently. the file names are usually expelled, after taking photos from the camera to the same album. this may be meaningful, the date and time when the image has been taken into the filename.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for turning and mirrors of the image and for data-based flush. if you use this latter option, will automatically be created a folder per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options During the transfer opens three more options to be carried out before the photos are stored on the record. if you select this, the corresponding entries are copied from the EXIF information into the IPTC fields. with the last option you can correct date & time for all downloaded pictures.</seg>
<seg id="264">For example, if you wish to use another file format as the default format, you can use the prefix photo -% Y-%% d:% S:% S. turn off the option to read the date & time. for more customization you should read the help of the command.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the camera file names, you have the possibility to change the file names in lowercase. or in uppercase, if you prefer it.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new filename, the & digious; for a photo is displayed below the name, the camera is displayed in preview. your settings for rename are saved and automatically used when you open the camera window.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digious, you can use all the information on the orientation of the camera to perform a automatic rotation during the shutdown. not all the cameras are ready. in the section side bar Metadata you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is normally switched on, and if your camera does not supplies this information, the photo is in original orientation. if you want to switch off the automatic rotation, use the button extension and select the Automatic rotation in the lower part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera has been recorded information on which the photo was taken, you can use & digial. these differences are based on the same album. not all the cameras are available in the same album. not all cameras make this information available. in the section side bar Meta Data, you can read which information about your camera may be embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is normally off off, and in this case it saves & digious; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this option, use the button extension and select there the option file-based strains at the bottom end of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to download photos from their calculator on your camera is a button to download. choose the file selection dialog & kde; you can select files that can be uploaded up. you can also choose more than a file with the Standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image is done, asks & digial; you, where the pictures will be uploaded up. select the desired folder and press OK to start the upload. the pictures will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general concept in this document and is indicated on a map that can be displayed on a map. the determination of the data can be performed from the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European Galileo or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photo biographers, it is interesting to link an image with a precise geographical site. not everyone uses an aircraft to envising an area through automatic recording of GPS data. environmental planer, military, police, architecture offices and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you forgot to have later, where exactly the photo was done, you can send a postcard to another & digious; users want to be localize the place of the photos, or simply show this aspect, it is good the position data of a photos.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is how to get the GPS data into the image? first you should know that exiv2 supports many GPS data fields, such as direction, artiitrailer and card conferences? there are at least three ways to reach this. directly with the right hardware, via a reworking of the GPS data and image files using the KIPI module for the geographical mapping (manual) and last about the manual input of known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera that has a GPS unit. but there are a few that works with GPS receivers. either as map module or through transmission of the data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from one device can be done using gpsman or gsbabel. you must save these data in the GPX format, since it is the only format supported by the module for geographic assignment.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are various programs for & Windows; and Mac OS, which can extract data from pictures and of the GPS and correlated. on the following page you can make the same under & Linux; do: psCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and latitudinal or other data, then you can use this script using the ExifTool by Phil Harvey. it uses the number of coordinates to be created, e.g. by maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com shows no european street cards. here are some European pages, at least in French, German and Spanish, which show all navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& digious, try to give you much control over its work processes how to give. there are many settings that you have to change the behaviour of & fixings. to set up to these settings. the setup dialog box is divided into eight sides. you can change between these steps by clicking on the symbols of the left.</seg>
<seg id="284">Action can display on embedded preview or image processing. set the default behavior of & fixings; fixed, if you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standard didact and copyright data. these data are written automatically in the appropriate IPTC data fields, if the option is written for downloading from the camera plate. also, these data are written into the IPTC fields.</seg>
<seg id="286">Autortitel is a synonym for authors name: this field should be the job name of the photographers. this field should be known as photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. since this is a detailed description of the author, this also has to be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">The editor is a synonym for providers: use this field to specify the picture. this must not be the author if it's for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press; if the image is a stock photo, then the group or agency will be shown here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions store the data in the appropriate IPTC rim. this ensures that the metadata are permanently displayed in the picture and are not only available in the database of & fixings; this metadata are also available and can be imported in & fixings; imported without losing.</seg>
<seg id="289">Image labeling as integrated label (JFIF) in JPEG pictures: this synchronizes the comments that you can read into your photos with which images are contained in images. attention: with images that have already been labeled up, they will be overwritten by & fixings.</seg>
<seg id="290">The page settings contains all options for information that appear when the mouse rests on the main window over a file. depending on the selected option, this information is displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; digious properties; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats. to define which file types & fixings are added to display, you can add file extensions to this list and remove any file in one & digious; Albumfolder, which has none of these extensions; ignored by & digious; ignored.</seg>
<seg id="292">Default settings can be reset you again by pressing the button on the right from each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The settings of the illuminating & fixings can be set on this page. however some pictures have different sizes and the synchronous mode is then not available. however, option & quot; In all image size ladenquot; if you have one, then you can obtain better character results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer another color, you can select this here. you can use the tool bar when using the image processing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and exposed areas of a picture can be marked with dark or bright colour in the picture. these colors are set here. in the image processing, this critic can be switched on with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">The Chroma Subsampling is meant that images can be coded into a higher resolution of light density as in the color information. please read this article in Wikipedia on the closer explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With set-up compression, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not require image quality since PNG requires a loss free algorithm. if you have a quick machine, you can put this value to a high compression. this means 1: a low and 9 high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the option TIFF files you can compress the deflate compression algorithm to TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it has no effect on the image quality since the deflate algorithm is loss-free.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the setting of lossless JPEG 2000 files you can save loss free. even if you have the lossless setting, the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than the normal JPEG. when this paragraph was written, metadata was not yet supported, but was in planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In previous versions of & digious, the image processing is only a picture viewer for photos. currently, it develops very quickly to a tool to manipulation of your photos. with this dialogue, you can change the settings of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The standard lame is that all green pixels are equal to ultra-violet light than the pixels of ultra-violet light. if you use this option, solve this option with a minimum loss of details. this option shows a little soft, eliminates the 2x2 screen pattern with the VNG- or the AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white image of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is used only if the white drain is not set. default, it is a fixed colour balance which was photographed on a white card which was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is supported only for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. the use of the second sensors has the effect that exposed photos in four steps more details in the advanced sources. for other cameras, this option will ignore this option.</seg>
<seg id="305">The default is the top, so the parts of your images are to start to consider as continuous white in the settings. setting colors will trigger some of fancy results since they display the peak in various roses. however, you can try to reconstruct some parts of the missing information from other industries.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible to satisfy as green and red. & fixtures are not so fast as green and red. & fixtures are therefore trying to reconstruct the lacking green and red percentage from the not saturated blue pixels. of course, this is a question how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the option, you get the option to set a level. here, a value of three is a compromise and can therefore be adjusted individually for each image.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the luminance according to your taste. you probably need to set it somewhat higher than the standard 1. however, this can also be done later in the image options of & fixings. to keep the time needed for the Demosaist, you should keep conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A Demosaohm algorithm is a digital image process that comes from the color-filtered image sensor that have many cameras and the one matrix color pixel are available. this algorithm is also known as CFA-interpolation or colour construction.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digious; and Dcraw will provide you three alternatives: Bilinear, VNG-Interpolation and AHD Interpolation (Variable number of gradient) was the first algorithm used by me. Bilinear is interesting when you are looking for a fast solution with an acceptable result.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color softening of your lenses you can set the rotational and blue correction values here. this is certainly the best method for a color correction, since it is carried out during the shell conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and gives instructions like those again should be given. there are also LCMS and & digious; information like the color information from a color space in the other to translate the colors as accurately as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior Asked Questions when a picture is opened in the image processing / color scheme module with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Colour profile folder, put here the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC, where you read all your profile. & digious, this folder considers during the start.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC profiles have shown here the option & quot; standard squot; for your profiles. everything can be changed when opening the shell file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color management view is an alternative to Xcalib or argyll. here are only your pictures colorfully not the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should be able to fit the camera manufacturer and model which you are using. there are some, such as Canon, which do not contain dtonal mapping or gammasts. currently corrected dcrack Gamma is not for conversions at 16 bit depth. this means that you must perform the color mapping itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are further options like the Soft Proof-Profile, with which you can emulate a picture from a device. this is very useful before you can print a smaller color area than your camera and some colors are therefore very satisfied, instead of converting to the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras it is quite evident that the colour profile for them is intended for them. unfortunately, not with the models of Canon. unfortunately, here is a table of cameras and profiles fit together. this answer is naturally unofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension can recognize the style for the purpose: F for precise style, L for landscapes, N for Neutral, P for portrait, P for portrait and S for standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; image plugin interface. it is an interface supported by a series of & kde; image poets and image processing; many modules support, which have been written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI modules installed, you will see a list of available modules. if you want to use, and these modules will then be loaded from & fixings; the modules will appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and above. some of these modules will also be seen in the context menu of the preset.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short-commands for tasks that are carried out by modules can be fixed in the menu under settings.</seg>
<seg id="324">More information (in English) about KIPI modules can be obtained via the KIPI project under http: / / www.kipi-plugg.org or in the manual of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the Diashau should be easy to understand. the upper controller adjusts the time between the image inputs, normally they are 4-5 seconds well. the other check boxes switches the metadata or from which at the bottom end of the pictures are embedded during the ad.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera characteristics are shown on the left side a list of all supported cameras. on the right side there is a button Automatic detection that is enabled to identify that the camera is properly connected, switched on and in the image mode. at present there are serial, USB- and USB / FireWire mass storage.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom end, you can set the path for USB- and FireWire- (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage cameras. this field is only active if you have a USB or FireWire-mass storage box from the camera. you have to specify the path, / mnt / Camera or / mnt / block, indicate your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digious camera, you need to connect the camera to your computer to put them in the display mode.</seg>
<seg id="329">Check out whether & digious came; the camera automatically detects. if not, you can set camera-odell and port. after you set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can choose any name for your camera. this will be shown in the menu cameras of the main window. if you own more than one camera, you can add all here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the option confirmation of options for shifting &gt; images in the trashcan, you can set the discussions of & fixings; when deleting a photos in an album. in the sections of a photos and deletion of a album you will find further details.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes due to the right side bar can remain silent through & fixings; applied if you use the option changes to the right side bar without inquire. otherwise, you must save the changes with the button.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also download the display of the welcome screen of & fixings; starting starting. this will accelerate the starting procedure from & fixings.</seg>
<seg id="334">The setting limm start to new photos search for new photos contact & digious albums / photos. this extends the starting time of & fixings; if something was deleted from the base file, asks & fixings; you can delete it from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Various shades schemas can be used in & fixings; used to adjust the main window to your taste. these settings can be selected using settings Design from the toolbar. a preview of available designs will be shown below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs are defined in simple text files. if you are interested in a new design for & digious, you will find further information about this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& fixion comes; contains a fast picture processing with some basic tools. you can use them to view your photos and to the correction and improvement. the image processing can be launched by a click with the left mouse button on the preview of a preview or selection of the updated ads / editing.</seg>
<seg id="338">The Image Processing contains a number of tools to improve your pictures. some of them are available as modules in & fixings; so you are not part of your distribution. for more information about the KIPI modules can be found in section Image Processing.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status line at the bottom edge of the window, the file name, current data transfer, magnification factor and current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top edge and including the tool bar for quick access to the most frequently used functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of image processing change your photos. however, no functions will change the original photo, before you can save the original photo. note that you cannot recover the original photo, as soon as you have saved the picture.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you should add a copy of your image before you change it. you can save it using file stores.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by creating or reproduce the image processing of the image processing in the tool bar. you lose any change that you have done in the photo since the last store.</seg>
<seg id="344">Almost any action of the image processing can be revoked or recovered. the last promotion can be reproduced or recovered by using editing, restore change from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you are often using this, you should take the shortcut, Ctrl; -z to the back and repeat Ctrl; -Umschalt-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you select the & LMB; on the back-of or rebuild button in the tool bar, you will get a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all the actions are made between also rolling or recovered.</seg>
<seg id="347">As soon as you have started the image processing, you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation software on the toolbar, image, image down or the entries in the menu file. if you have made changes in the current photo, you will be asked if you want to back up.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can start in the photo and zooming in that you use Ctrl; mouse or the symbols in the tool bar or the entries in the toolbar menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the tool bar: select the magnification factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full Screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode. if you want to use the Esc button. normally you can't change this toolbar code. if you don't want to call this in the subordination dialog of & digious, you can call it from & fixings; main window. see the section to set up the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can print the image in the menu file, and get the default & kde; print dialog. you can customize the settings here before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu, you can print single pictures or whole phrases. all image look can be printed on your selection. you just have to select the pictures with the standard methods and you will need to choose the images from the menu Export Printing assistants. if you follow the assistant, you only need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & digious window, main window has a side bar at the right edge, which presents important information and actions for the selected images. the same sidebar is available without the navigation components, also displayed in the picture processing. it will be displayed if one of the five riders is clicked on:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple Click on the same rider lets the sidebar appear, or disappear again in the rim.</seg>
<seg id="355">In order to enter with unlimited size or add the text below. the text is UTF-8 compatible. that means that all special characters are allowed. the label will be copied to the EXIF- and IPTC- fields so that you can use other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are truncated and special characters are formed after 2000 characters. if you want to use the IPTC labelling in other applications, you should note these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have commented it either the button on the user or change to the next image, the label will then be saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">In addition to the user button, there is one button More. with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database. however, this will always be carried out if you have chosen a metadata setting that will always be written into the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="359">The Section review will show an evaluation scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorts. it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar, or with the key shortcut. in order to evaluate several pictures at the same time, select these from and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The evaluation is written in the IPTC field urgency. the coding is followed by the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword view shows a search box for the words of the words, the words and a selection box with the previously mentioned in this & digious box.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is adapted dynamically to the entered search word. you can easily restrict the number of possibilities in search of a keyword quickly. this ability is particularly useful if you have many words.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom end is another relief at the input of Keywords at a picture series. if you have entered various words, these are saved for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Words can also be set by marker the appropriate check boxes in the tree. all tags of a image are stored in the IPTC field Keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If you select several pictures in the main screen and select a keyword in the keyword tree, this will only be applied to the printed image and not on the entire selection, if you want a selection with a keyword, please read the keyword filter section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The default line filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window. normally, the left side bar will be used with their album, - data, keyword and search terms. if additionally one or more sample filters are used from the right side, only the cutting quantity of these two are available. all in the words are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also draw tags and leave. suppose you select several pictures in the main view. if the keyword already exists, you can simply drag it from the right side bar and place on the selection. as a dialog box, you asks whether you want to put the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window depicts the pictures on one calendar day. the keyword filter is selected on one of the words. they were selected with Ctrl + a, and afterwards a keyword from the right-tree-tree were drawn and put there. a dialog asks whether this keyword should be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes will be held at any start of the program. it can also be switched on under settings.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you rule with and created a rule with and determine that it would have one or should have to change this easily with a double click on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry after which is sought in the database. this may be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or a string, which is already set up in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can define a Extended search over all the elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to grouping options only, you only need the check box at the end of the rule and then use the button. see the options as follows:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why were Picasaweb or Flickr not listed? the free disk space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save images in full resolution.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was written mainly by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I used it mainly to & digious implementation.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why one needs a colourful deviation from the colors of your camera or scanners, you can achieve a predictable deviation from the actually photographed or fed colors. with a colourless workflow, you can reach the colors on your monitor from your camera or the scanner, or publish the colors that you print out of your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the topic comes on color management, then everyone wants to press how to press the buttons. unfortunately, the meaning of this tutorial is necessary to provide you sufficient backinformation about color management. additionally, you should make links with deeper information to make your own informing decisions to make you desired results.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflows have met all the criteria listed below, then you must not worry about diting administration.</seg>
<seg id="380">You are working on a monitor that is calibrated on the sRGB color space (for more information please see below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only different educational expenditures are by e-mail or web, where the RGB of the de-facto standard is standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if the RGB works so well and the life for all so easy, why should one use another color space and do not need to make thoughts about paging?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of the limitation of sRGB compared to the colors that we really see is shown below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors that we can see the huseshoe region, and the colors in the RGB color space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger colors, please visit Bruce Lindblooms side and click on info and then on Information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I need to kiss my monitor? if I decided to work only in the RGB color space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you work in the sRGB color space or not, you have to make your monitor the circle. if you work in the color space of the RGB values, then you need to use your monitor using the RGB standard of the RGB standard, using an appropriate monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections to improve the image in most cases. use it before you try to try a further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions normalize, the same, automatic and contrast of the menu corrected automatic correction automatically try to make your colors the best. they will experiment with these effects to see which works best with your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scaled the lampholder values about the entire picture, so the dark point is black and the brightest point so bright as possible without changing its color bugs. this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or balanced.</seg>
<seg id="391">Down the same method: this method adjusts the luminance factor of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity of a image, sometimes produces even rubbish. it is a very powerful operation that causes either miracles on a picture or destroyed it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic: this method maximizes the color range in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and bright borders and adjust the red, green and blue channels on the entire history of the history.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method enhances the contrast and the luminosity of the RGB values of a image by which move the lowest and highest values on the greatest possible range and a new jiustation of all values. this is only visible with balanced images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white correction of & fixings came; is a semi Automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photos.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white correction of white correction is slightly restricted to a colour space with 8-bit per color. if you can do so far from the original screen, you can perform the white immediately in the shell mode, which works in 16-bit mode, so your ways to get better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white equivalent algorithm of the copyright by Pawel T. Jochym. it uses the menu entry color paste in the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left-hand side, both the original picture and the preview of the target image is adapted. if you like to see the original whip, it is enough to look back to the original window.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photos has a red marker. the luminance of the Pixels below this marker is displayed as vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">To the right above, an histogram is shown that once you have a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, most pixel are very small Luminance values. with one button you can choose whether one of the three colors or your sum will be shown. the sum will be called Luminance.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result is depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. the shadow is adjustable to improve your photos or down the shadow details of your photos.</seg>
<seg id="401">Anstat with the above controls allows you to use the color temperature pipette. press on this button and then click on the picture preview for calculating the color temperature of white flip. on this type, the temperature and green values are automatically set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can reset the white immediately with the list of default settings. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposed Indicator increases the colors, if more than a color channel of the Pixels is overexposed. this will be shown in the preview as a pure indicator, and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The buttons are saving and loading exactly this. any setting of the white image which you have set you can save to a text file and then load back later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The default settings sets all filter values again on their standard values and the corresponding neutral white balance. note that even neutral settings can be added as your original. if you store this original picture.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can adjust the coefficients per color channel of the image here. 8-bit coding is better for high quality images. this encoding takes more plate space, calculus and stands only for formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as for the editing of raw. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. colour tongs can be carried out through the base window for the usage of colour profiled. a detailed instructions for using colour profiling allows you to rate the color administration.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is available in the menu under color correction. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust to multiple color channels at the same time, allowing you to make these for multiple photos. this is helpful if your camera or your scanner always require the same mistakes. in the manual of the audio correction you will find further information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the degree of gravity that you will find under color gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digious; tool Farbeffective provides you four color effects, a solar effect, a Velvia filter, a Neon Effect and an edge filter available.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of the chemical processing, Solarisation, also called Sabatier, was a effect of the image complete, and afterwards the development of the image completed. this was the effect that the brighter areas darker and the colors were inverted with the second illumination. the result was a partial negative of the image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar ization. at approx. 50% intensity shows the image what is chemically possible. an additional increase is finally generates a negative image that is not so on photo paper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar power plant. the original image is the (1) and this is processed (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from a saturation that makes it more powerful contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and smooth. try it easy to embellished many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for a native color film which is produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. this name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and therefore a reference to his smooth image structure. Velvias strongly saturated fatty acids, but also some photographers, especially those who are hardly a landscapes.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neo-filter simulates Neonlight on the contrast-edge. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and slider repetitions the strength of the neonlight. with large images, the filter can overload the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to capture the different color limit of your photos using the tools in the menu. once you are happy with the result you can use the button Ok and you will be used.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you want to get a photo of poor lighting conditions, you can get a good choice if you want to increase ssaturation instead of saturation. all changes you can perform in preview. if you like the outcome, you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool Gradation and the simple candlite intensity / contrast / Gamma is the tool of sound correction for improving the exposure. also, if the dialog for this tool is very complicated, you need only the area of slider. specifically the three slider below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graphs of the intensity, an histogram, active canals or the selected area. under the Graphene, three sliders can be clicked on the corners that are moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn to learn it is the knob and change it on how the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right-hand side the original and preview of the picture can be viewed. the preview is dynamically modified, based on the settings of the image, the following options are available on the left.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box can be set if the histogram with a linear or logarithmic y-axis is commonly dominated. with images the large areas of a constant color, the linear histogram of a single pillar is dominated. in this case, the logarithmic influence is useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three knob: the top for dark tones, the medium for bright tones and the lower frequencies, commonly called Gammasts.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color paintings can be used in the preview of the original billets in order to automatically adjust the input values of the shadows, medium and bright tones. furthermore, there is a button for a fully automatic alignment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow manual values for each area. there are also two knob that can be used to evaluate the output values as with the input values. for example, compression of the output values can be used e.g. as a background, while anything else can be seen in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: this button will automatically set the image values automatically depending on the intensity of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save and loading: with these buttons, the set-up values can be saved in the filesystem and later reloaded. in addition, the Gimp-format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three color pettes, the input values will automatically be adjusted for all shadows, medium and solar sound. activate the color pette which you want to use and click on the preview of the original image for red, green, blue and the luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The option overexposed Indicator controls all colour channels to display overexposed pixels and display the combined earnings of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it's no effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below is an example for the alignment of input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photos. intensity and alpha Channel, and the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the correct picture (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left hand, half of the original and the target picture is displayed. the preview is dynamically updated depending on your settings. the following options are available on the right side:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modifications channel: this selection box enables the channel to be specified by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this box there are two symbols to switch between a linear and logarithmic view. for images that have been recorded using a digital camera, the linear mode has been generating a wide beam. in this case, the logarithmic mode helps in this case.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a short rope to the right, e.g. the bright tones, you can see that these bright tones are corresponded with dark extracts and the corresponding image pixels darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photos, a red mark is visible. if you want to change this marking on the curve, the right line is displayed on the curve that is the original value. create a point on this line and move it off and down until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save and loading: with these buttons, you can do exactly this. each curve you can hereby generate this file system and then be loaded. the file format for this is Gimp short-format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you use this method and the three color petals automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of the shadow, medium and solar sound. activate the color pette which you want to use and click on the original image for the rotational, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The option overexposed Indicator controls all colour channels to display overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel, you get the combined result. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it's no effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black-and-white photo that has been corrected in the luminance channel. shadow and sun sound was used with the color pette and applied to the curves (1) and the correct (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel mixer of & fixion came; image processing is a tool to improve the colour ducts or change the color casings of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the color shades of the images. you can process it from the menu Color mixer for image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first hint as you can correct the relative distribution and impact. the left range of the window shows you a preview. the original can be viewed by comparison to your own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you place them in the image, a vertical line appears in the histogram to display the respective color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are right below: regulator for red, green and construction allow you to activate these channels. if you also activate the color settings, this is especially convenient, when the channel mixer is then able to reduce the usage of great black-and-white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix Monochrome, the reduction of a color is one of the visible noise that looks in the same place in colour channel and their crawler looks different at each channel. if the case is, you can improve your monochrome conversion in which you need to reduce the colourless first.</seg>
<seg id="447">Saving and loading buttons are used precisely for this purpose. any mixer setting can be saved, and then load. the used file format is the Gimp channel mixer.</seg>
<seg id="448">The option overexposed Indicator controls all colour channels to display overexposed pixels and display the combined earnings of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it's no effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been adjusted. the option Luminance is activated. the original picture is below (1) and the illustrated picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography was always fascinating because of your abstracts. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a step, as color images can be easily converted to the computer. also with a set of movie roll profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford's FP4 Plus, Ilford Pan 5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter. this looks good, with all scenarios and fits particularly good to portraits of the sky. like the 004 Cokin (TM) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange filters: simulates a black / white film exposure with a orange liner filter. this improves landscapes, marine scenes and air photos. similar to the 002 Cokin (TM) orange filter.</seg>
<seg id="454">Rotary filters: simulates a black / white film irradiation with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic celeration effects and can simulate lunar contents to day time. similar to the 003 Cokin (TM) rotters.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with an yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to 001 Cokin (TM) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: produces warm bright and medium tones for a bit coldness in the satteln. this is very similar to the process of flattering of a printing and redevelopment in a Sepiatonic. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 Cokin (TM) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With the & digious, tool texture can apply decorative textures to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your picture, regardless of it a colour picture is or not, you can look like an oil painting on a canvas, the Stich of an old master, a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a wall painting on a wall. the menu entry image texture can be used for this.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: move this parameter to the right increases the depth of the depth or three dimensional stability of the texture on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper text effect has been used on the photo below. the original picture is (1) and the changing below (2). the relief model was set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">Added the & digious; tool frame can add a decorative frame to be added a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">To keep the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photos, there is no easy task. a possibility to set his attention is to put the painting a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier for the scattered eye. under the frame, the module can be started from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: using this parameter, set the desired frame type for your image. through the picture with a colored line, niepce renders it with a thin three-dimensional frame which is ideal for a buttonhole and decoratively add a decorative frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">The width of the frame is in percent. the value range for width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">This goal is to be larger than the original, but the same aspect ratio is bigger than the original, but the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing the images, especially if you have using the tool after aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this practical tool, you can insert easily a formatted text in a painting at any point. this also goes to several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. enter text surface, orientation, color from the color space and the character set with his features such as you need. depending on the picture, the larger must be the character set. finally, choose a frame around the text and / or a clear background. already the picture is finished.</seg>
<seg id="468">Any setting you have chosen for your text, you can change to the button "OK." after the image has been saved once, the text is part of the image. it cannot be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">Click with the & fixings; Tools template can create a template on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The menu template onto the image processing can be used to lay templates on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the templates there are no restrictions on the size and orientation. you need to add the PNG file format and want to add with maximum compression (9) to add to the file size of the template; simply send an e-mail in English to & fixings; mailing list of digious user @ kde.org..</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool to the first time you need to put your templates with the button base file in the dialog. select here the folder you want to copy the template files. these settings will be noted for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder set for templates, a building view, which reflects the folder's structure of a stencil. selecting a folder will update the preview bar of the templates.</seg>
<seg id="474">Under the preview you are three buttons with which you can change the magnification factor and modify the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this knob increases the shown picture. it is centered for the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Shrink: this knob shrinks the lower picture. if you want to use the position of the mouse. if you want to use the template on the whole image, you have to cut the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move it: simply use this button to move under the template. take the image and place it at the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to apply the template onto your image. the image will then be adjusted automatic of the preview size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digious, there are three different tools for sharpening. each of them has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpen is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but produced in dark areas, grains pictures.</seg>
<seg id="481">Spicy mask works on the contrast of the edges to look like a picture. actually, it works more psychovisual. you can use it to remove atmospheric Dunes and makes it a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is protected by copyright from Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">It is possibly the best of the three, since it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters to adapt.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without Focus as well as most digitalised pictures require a correction of sharpness. elements that are smaller than the resolution should be put together to a common color. the same phenomenon can be observed when colour points can be printed on paper. SLR cameras usually require more successively sharpening than normal cameras for private use.</seg>
<seg id="484">In JPEG pictures, one camera has been used to use internal sharpness. images in the shell format is always necessary to be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanner apply a sharpness filter already during the reading of the image. if you disable this image, you get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get usable results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening value. this can be viewed with the menu entry correct sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="487">They ought therefore to be careful, since the results will not work much of course: the sharpness increases the sharpness of the edges, but also amplifies the noise. in general, it is achievable via the menu entry. on request, you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution to draw a little soft than it is much easier than it. use the tool for softer with the menu entry correct and experimenting with settings. the preview window displays the effect on the right-hand side of the dialog displays the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter unurred is a very good tool to remove the veil of your photos. a demonstration can see here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help the image to edit. the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often produce good results and should be tried first. increasing the radius or consideration. if you generate the imsharpest mask, become noise and the impression of grates in the vicinity of sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius constitutes a like many pixels on each side of an edge through the filter. high-resolution images allow bigger radii. you should therefore sharpen images in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the wiper picture is added to the original. this makes the strength of the sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="494">The swelling is a fraction from the maximum RGB value and the difference of difference. you can define a minimal difference to define an edge of filters. in this way areas, areas with a soft switch between the tones of sharpening, Himmler and water surface avoided.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the unblurate filter. the original picture is the (1) and the machined image (2). unsharp masked with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a swelling = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digious; tool-focused on a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyright protected by Ernst Lippe protected by copyright.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries an image to & quot; refocused problem than just to try the photo. it is used to use a technique called FIR Viennese. it is used to start better results as an unblurge mask. it can usually run even better results as unblurred. you can start it by using colors by pressing colors.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular folding works much better than the Gauge's folding. the Gauge's folding has a very long tail, depends far from the original pixel size, the FIR Vienna Inverse of the Gauge 'folding is affected by most cases even very strongly influenced by the distant pixels. that causes undesirable results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular folding. it is the most important parameter for use of this module. for most pictures, the default value should set 1 good results. you can set a higher value if your image is very unsharp, but then should be on canyumshield.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: to increase the correlation can help Artefakte. correlation can be used by 0-1. default values are 0.5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0,95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the visual effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Pirate filter: an increase in the space filter can help you reduce artifacts. however, values are higher than 0.1 only rarely. if the noise filter is too low, & eg; 0 is the image quality very bad. a usable value is 0,03. a high value will still be higher.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauss's sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauge's sharpness. in most cases, you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying Artefacts, so you may also increase the correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matter size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. if you select large values for the circular sharpness or the Gauge's sharpness. note that module is very slow if you choose large values for these parameters. in most cases you should select a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">Saving and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any sequence of parameters will be set to you later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try out all trimming, colour and intensity corrections on the picture before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before you change the image elsewhere. the reason for this is that much operations changes the not immediately visible, but later left unpleasant artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you read images and compress, & eg; than JPEG, you should use the module on uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally produces unblurate better results than sharpening. this could be caused by using unsharp masked to use a larger neighborhood than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically it has to generate unblurate artistically. for the Viennese filter it can never be removed. for the Viennese filter it is always at least the result of the FIR Viennese filter, always at least as well as the spicy mask. the FIR Viennese filter is often better when machining small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters, on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp color image has to be corrected. this image has been made with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information about the methodology of sharpness, you can read a technical comparison in English under this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The knob weaves the insharpness of the division which has been darkened to create a natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The tintinge allows an adapted colour for the pupil. if you want blue eyes rather than dark dark, then you can set this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The image error correction is one of the most developed tool in order to remove the desired artifact with an unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The algorithm has been developed by the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various settings as strong points to simplify the restoration. the available presets are shown below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings, you can use the riders and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detailed detection p [0, 100]: this controls the maintenance of details. a smaller value leads to a smooth glass of smooth and pressing details. a value of 0.9 should thus obtain that no sharpening is needed. please note that details are always under the direction dependency.</seg>
<seg id="520">Direction dependency alpha [0,100]: a small value is smooth in all directions, while a value is close to 1 only in one direction. JPEG Artefakte are removed best with a value close to 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smoothing [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing about all. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore, set this value matching the degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter specifies greater structures. the higher this value is needed, the more is needed, since it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh's Turbulence effect, it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: indicates how often the algorithm is running. normally, 1 or 2 is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angular progress da [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic Alpha. if Alpha is also selected, you should also choose small angle. make sure that small angle should generate a long runtime. you should therefore select this value so maximum and acceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral step width [0,1, 10]: integral step width in pixels. you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never exceeds 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear Interpolation use: the more quality you receive by selecting this option is only low. it doubles the runtime. we therefore recommend it to allow him to allow.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons are saving and loading exactly this. any setting of image error can now be saved in a text file and later to be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="528">Image error correction is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can still last very long and take a high CPU load. you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button demolition.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how to be corrected like image error with Small Artefakt. the module will be used on a photo that created in Guatemala City with a analog camera, that caused by a bad film storage during the trip, the original picture is below (1) and the correct picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digious, robotic reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce frame rate. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters for example to remove stains and other artifacts, e.g. from dust or hair on the lens, too. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Moirediscovered; effects of saved images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you require further information about sensor levels of digital cameras, you can read this tutorial in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot picture above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grained noise that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the subwindow settings can stay with default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. great values improve the time the filter per pixel are needed and can be pitized by the radius indicated above the image and the colour in him is smoothed and the smaller error is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness distance. this value sets the pixel distance between the filter to the front. if it is increased, robbers are extinguished. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image data may not receive more and robbering or dirt occurs again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. if it is too strong, the frequency response of the filter can occur. if it can be too strong, or smokes can occur. set it on a value near the maximum if you want to remove a weak room or JPEG artifact without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance of the image. we recommend to change either color or luminance to improve your image. these settings do not influence the smoother process by details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Colour: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend to change either color or luminance to improve your image. these settings do not influence the smoother process by details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gammatolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas which typically are stronger, but contaminated the shadow ranges.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the adjustment of phasenjitterdamping. this value is defined like fast the adaptive filter radius on variations of luminance. if it is increased, the edges may occur. if it's on a minimum, robbering and Phasenjitter may occur in the edges. he can remove robbers and is the recommended method for it.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save under and loading: these buttons are used precisely. all parameters for the roughing, which you have set, can be saved in the file system and then loaded.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how to change the noise of your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected (2). the noise reduction was applied to the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is crunchy for your purpose. the solution to draw a little softer than a picture is luckily to correct turntables with the menu entry correct and experimenting with the glittering window. the preview window displays the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digious came; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photo acts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restorations gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted arising from your images. it is very well adapted to remove delicacy, crater, compression acts and local errors found in digital, original or subsequently digitalised images. the glands occurs along the image contours and thus gets the content as it is also the human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for colour and texturing. the algorithm is developed using another tool, the image error correction was developed by the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / Frannar and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG Artefakte reduce: compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas it produces some compression & quot; Artefaktequot; - small standards can be seen in uncompressed image. this setting is supposed to correct this problem.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons are saving and loading exactly this. any setting of photo restration can hereby be saved in a text file and later to be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restore is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can still last very long and take a high CPU load. you can therefore finish the calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can reduce how a photo with equal noise. the module is applied on a black and white photo that with an Minolta (TM) HP-5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the infamous film grains on the faces. the original picture is below (1) and the corrected below (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see a further example of the photo restoring. this time, textures was read on an old colour photo that caused by a scanner. you can see the scan artifacts that could see from the scannerlighting and the photo paper. the original picture is below (1) and the correct picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digious; tool Hotpixels allows you to remove Hotpixels of photos which have been protected with a CCD camera, eight have been used algorithms from the JPEGPixi project that are protected by copyright by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, tote or hot pixels are particularly high quality raw mode photos, as many cameras with JPEG compression about a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixel rate; and "quot; bright pixel rate; at a photograph with a dark image subtract method. there is currently no manual method to select the poor pixel.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the wizard with the button darkscreen. the tool will recognize automatically the hot and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the picture preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it is important that you can record the dark image directly in the port to discover new hot or bright pixels through CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First described in the previous section, you should download the appropriate dark picture to the correct picture. an automatic processing of the dark rendering will notice the bad pixel. note that the assistant shows the last dark image and reloads this automatically in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The picture range and the preview can help you correct the result within the picture. the preview window displays the output of the filter with current settings. bad pixels are highlighted in all areas of view.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area around the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. select the best filter method to interpolishing these pixel blocks. these are the available filters:</seg>
<seg id="561">Duration: an average of the neighboring pixel is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation, this is made separately for horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block will be moved to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are moved to compute a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolishing the pixels in block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Kubisch: all pixels with a gap of 3 or less will be moved to compute a bi-Cuban surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim), which then use the defective pixels in block to interpolishing.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photograph, consisting of a defective digital camera with sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure, the original image has been enlarged to 300% (1) and the correct picture is below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digious came; vignettification correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. exposed corners, a picture to correct.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lens, especially those in the medium and large photo format, often cannot illuminate the entire sensor range. instead & quot; vignetting quot; (shady) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light to the sensor. telephoto lenses show this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, it also has disadvantages. many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 at the aperture filter which should be impossible to keep the camera with hand. wide angle lens should also be able to use a opening of f / 16 or smaller because otherwise unsharpen effects arise by movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">Using the large exposure areas of today's filming and color or color scanner, it is possible to simulate the effect of a centerity that without this filter it is possible to simulate the transformation of a centerous correction, which is protected by John Walker. the algorithm is protected by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three points you can control the vignettification filter filter and with three further exposure of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light-amplification at the point of the largest density filter. the default density is 2.0, or accidental laser with a aperture of 2, dejupset the density to compensate a larger degree of vignetting, reduce it to compensate a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Leukite, contrast and Gamma settings: editing a image with the vignettification correction reduces the luminosity of the pixel. you need to readjust the exposure of target image with these options. regulating the regulator, you need only positive values to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a fine retuning of the target image, then let the values for luminosity / contrast / Gamma at zero and use the gradation from the & digious, image processing from the menu Color Gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the vignettification correction on a picture. the original image (1) shows the vignetting in the corners and (2) shows the correct picture. a leukamplification and counterpoint correction was also carried out in the image with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & fixings came; lens distortion is a tool to correct the effect of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortion. colour distortion can not be corrected using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second grades treated the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex shape of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third grades has a similar circular effect, but flattened off to edges. this correction is not applied in the mold.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient may be corrected the remote corners, opposite the second grades. if you combine these two, each geometric distortion can be cut almost eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">Generally: this value controls the strength of the distortion of the second grades. with negative values, tons-shaped distortions can be corrected and positive values cisite distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of distortion-fourth degree. this value does stronger elsewhere in the middle of the image. for most lenses the 'corners parameter has the reverse sign of the parameter General.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value scale the image size and performs an correction of the first gradient through. negative values can be reduced while positive the image.</seg>
<seg id="583">Light: this value adjustment the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values they increase.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, illustrates the dialogue with a preview correction. values that use you for your image are stored and using the next start as default values.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tonnage or kissenic correction should be performed before all trimming or size changes. best result, make this correction as all the first. if you have a picture of new and then reduce an overty-shaped correction, the effect of falsehood.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you help the best correction you can display this tool a vertical and a horizontal relief line. move it to an important place such as the sea level or a building wall, in your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines on this spot. in the connection, you can correct the tonnage / kissenic distortion using the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a kisite distortion is the resulting image black edges. you can remove this with the trimming tool in the menu Transaction cutting from the image processing or via the zoom regulator of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">For most images, the tonnage-shaped correction is sufficient. the next logical step for some motifs like pictures from the front, frames and paintings makes it the perspective so correct that if you keep the camera with your hand, you always have a slight distortion of the perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the US-shaped correction on a church in Norway. the original picture is below (1) and the correct picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate infrared film of the GvaccGura.org website which is accessible under this URL. the filter reproduces the known Ilford (TM) SFX200 IIR film, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse, you can view the effect on different parts of the image.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can simulate two parameters for film grains and film sensitivity (ISO). the ISO regulator changes the quantity of film grains and the dominance of color green (chlorophyll in nature) in converting. green meadows are white like snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter colour ducts to reproduce infrared film, especially the green channel makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos since the color information are missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infra-red file format used on a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original picture is below (1) and the illustrated image below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values generate a type of Aura in the shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digious plant filter is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film grains on your pictures, such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X, known for the sensitivity of the films - the manufacturer great silver-grains of the photoemulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film gradation effect gives your photo a certain atmosphere or seems to move back into the past. the treated image gets a timeless atmosphere get rid of everyday life. if you like this special, Gallery-like, road maps, especially in your monochroms photos, you need to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the regulator, the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated for control of intensity and granularity. the default value is, although higher values are required, however, if you need more grains, you can use the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of film gravitational effect on a black / white image. the original picture is the (1) and that worked (2). the used film photosensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digious plant; filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting. it uses an urgent algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digious, filter oil painting gives your digital images a nice look like an oil painting. natural pictures and styles are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two knob to influence this effect. the upper selects the pin size between one and five. thicker brush are better suited for large images. flatten the glare or from the other side, the hiness.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original picture is marked with the (1) and the image is marked with the (2). pin size for this 640 pixel image is 1 and Glue 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digious; filter charcoal drawing uses color and intensity gradients. pictures whose gradient can change slowly. it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to skate. this would have good pictures to start.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two knob with a range of values ranging from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper controller chooses the pin size and the bottom adjustable the contrast (glar).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the charcoal drawing filter. the original image (1) and the modified image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be improved further through adjustment of the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digious; filter engraving shaped your picture in 3-D, as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digious; filter engraving is a fast tool to restore your pictures with a 3-D effect. it works very good at images with a simple structure, in which colour is not the most important in content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to turn the image into a gray, mondaring landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows the contrast of the filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of engraving filter. the original (1) and the machined image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group, you can transform a normal photo into a art book using distortion effects. it uses protected protected algorithms by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: divide the image in cells, and makes it look like if it is considered through glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Shaft Stage 2: analog to the wave blocks 1 will be distorted with a different version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can terminate this effects at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group, you can transform a normal photo into an art book using unsharpness effects. it uses protected protected algorithms by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Unsharpness: wiping the picture along stoned lines that go out of a core. this simulates the imsharpness of a zoomic camera and produces a dynamic expression of often in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radical unsharpness: wiping the image through rotation of pixels around a center. this simulates the imsharpness of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance: wiping the picture to generate the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object seems back in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Motion-sharpness: ignorance the picture by horizontal movements of pixels. this simulates the imsharpness of a linear moving, z: B: coming from a car or train photographing, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Significant imsharpness: wiping the picture soft into the dark and strong in bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or to add a warm and subtle of light.</seg>
<seg id="620">Flow sharpness: wiping the picture by random displacement of pixels and simulates the insharpness of a arbitrary camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent unsharpness: finds the paddling pool in the picture and wiped out these without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: divide the photo in rectangular cells and then created it by filling with an average pixel rate, new.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="624">The valves are a nice little tool to make rainy on your picture. this makes it natural your images a wet appearance. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn protected by copyright algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Tropical size allows to change the size of the tropics. since the size of the picture is not enabled, it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images. number changes the number and density of drops. fish oil changes the optical effect of drops on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can hold with the & digious; image processing a range from raindrops. do not use the range of tools to choose the area, e.g. a vision that should stay free. if you start the filter, the area will remain free from raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the regression filter. the original picture (1) shows a quiet sunset and the machined image (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">When the photo has the wrong orientation, you can bring it through mirrors or turning into the proper orientation. the tools can be found in the menu transformations or transformers.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo grazing is definitely one of the most developed tools in order to enlarge a photograph with a minimum loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">To shrink a picture is simple. the big question is how to get an image of bubbles and keep details sharp? how can you be found in a picture? how can you find the missing information or guess? the CImg algorithm is used here, making it a good job. try it and you'll see it itself.</seg>
<seg id="631">When a photo of the wrong size you can change it to the desired size with the mold size. choose transformations size in the menu and specify the target values. the dialog can be seen below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool used for size is using a linear interpolation method to increase the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality, then try the tool to blow up.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image processing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. Splines Interpolation. using an improved approach. the underlying algorithm was developed by the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You must say the tool as you want to change the size. these settings are available in the rider New Size and are shown below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Keeping an aspect ratio: if this setting is enabled, the new size will preserve the aspect ratio of the original size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter specifies greater structures. the higher this value is needed, the more is needed, since it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh's Turbulence effect, it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The buttons Save as and loading will be used exactly. any one can enlarge as text file and later to be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo grazing is very fast with what it makes, but it can still last very long and take a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below for example, when a small color image has been increased to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (2) is the result of linear standard magnification for comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">The cut of a photos is not only common operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool to summarize a picture. the image processing is simply just the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and draw the rectangle, then you'll see this rectangle while you move your mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">When you start the mouse button again, the area of the photos will be cut out. thus you can change a good overview like your photo after cutting. you can easily create the size of the right edge by removing the edges of the rectangle. a new rectangle create it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">As soon as you are satisfied with the cutting machine, use the push button of the frame processing in the toolbar and the photo is tailored (Ctrl; + X). use the entries file saving or file stores under the menu file to save the newly designed photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the swing area, you can change the size of the rectangle by postpone the corners using the mouse. the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog will remain.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the set of the aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as high-format or cross-format. in the high format it is always assigned to the larger value of the height and in the crosswise format of the width.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool supports an aspect ratio as an aspect ratio. this means that it is always equal to whether you use centimeters, Inch or any other physical size. you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to activate the selection automatically horizontal or vertical.</seg>
<seg id="647">Below in the dialog you can use the Max. ratio button for cutting on the maximum possible, depending on the chosen relationship and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool after aspect ratio saves up its settings depending on image orientation (Horizontal or vertical). if you are using the trimming tool, these settings are stored as default values in the EXIF tables, so that the EXIF data is reflected the cut image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The help of the connectable help allow help to bring out your pictures better. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonic particles are based on the principle of similarity. as the third party rule, harmonic triangles are an opportunity to share a rectangle in similar harmonic triangles.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden center: the golden center is a split up for different natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the blossom leaves of a sunflower. it dives in all possible things that we find as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden split is the error number 1,618033988... and it was used already in the ancient Egyptians and Greeks, which are using your temple and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden split in all times when you build your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is taken by the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; from where each number is equal to 1 equal to the sum of their two previous numbers. the resulting divider is 1: 1.618 the golden center. a composition of this rule is shown as a visually harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center represents smoother support lines such as you occupy a picture. these help are shown below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spiral will bring you good results to generate good results for your photos. compared to the third party, the golden spiral produces a liquid line of the eye through the picture. this type of composition leads the view of the panel along the line of spiral design and creates a symmetrical visual river.</seg>
<seg id="656">A further rule are the rectangles of the golden spiral. these rectangles are used to produce the golden spiral. this may be a line of the composition. this may be a line of or different objects. this may just be able to lead the eye without having the eye, it will accomplish its task.</seg>
<seg id="657">The golden triangles is also derived from the above-discussed golden spiral. note that in contrast to harmonical triangles, golden triangles is no equilateral triangles. diagonal to make these lines a static object can be seen dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you are using golden triangles, use a effect of professional photographer dynamic Symmetry. try your image focus on one of the intersections and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you can't reach differently.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options horizontally mirror and vertical mirror can be used to mirror the harmonious particles.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color you can set the color of the auxiliary lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the auxiliary lines can be invisible. on this type you can customize the color of lines on your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free rotation is a tool to rotate a picture around any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a photo, it is easy to keep the camera not vertically or horizontally. this creates an image to be rotated vertically or horizontally. you can manually repair this with the & fixings; photo processing and tool free rotation. choose transformational free rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Turn your picture with the slider angle. the values on this slider are displayed in degrees. with the button Preferences, you can reset the slider again to 0 degrees. a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the picture will be shown on the right.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help the module free rotation a horizontal and a vertical line available. move the mouse pointer to the two lines. after moving it over a key point of the image, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you shot a picture, you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. a possibility to repair this is the function transformational cutting from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the picture is automatic cutting. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The option Anti-aliasing will unlock the image a bit after the rotation. be aware, however, please note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspectral transformation is performed by a fixed point to the so-called reference point. this point is shown in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">In order to change the perspective, you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview will then be recharged automatically. on the right-hand side of the dialog you will find some information which help you to change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: displays the width of the new image, including the empty areas which are produced by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: shows the height of the new image, including the empty areas which are created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Top left: shows the current angle in degrees on the upper left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle to the right: shows the current angle in degrees on the upper right edge of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">At the bottom left: shows the current angle in degrees on the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle to the right: shows the current angle in degrees on the bottom right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the image will be a bit dirty. for a single adjustment, this effect is small but two adaptations generate a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="677">After which you have attached the perspective, you will get intimestable triangular holes at the corners. a possibility to transfer this is the image with transformational cutting from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The mould tool is used to move a portion of the image to the right and move the other part into the opposite direction. this is no rotation, the image will be distorted. with other words, a rectangle is transformed into a parallelogram. you can start this module via Transformers.</seg>
<seg id="679">Check your picture by using the horizontal angles and vertical angle. if you press the horizontal and vertically at the same time, the angle will be reset to zero. a preview of the effect will be shown and the new dimensions of the target image will be shown on the right side of the view.</seg>
<seg id="680">To help you get a vertical and horizontal line. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall of a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the check tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have conducted the check, the picture will be wiped a bit. for a single shift, this effect is usually neglected, but two shades have twice as much knowledge and therefore should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After crossing the image has the image of unusual triangular holes in the corners. a possibility to remove this is the image with transformational cutting from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digious; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write. the available formats depend on your system and, in some cases, from the way how this libraries have been compilated. in most distributions you will have a large number of image formats with & fixings.</seg>

<seg id="726">The & inspirational; project has set itself the goal to replace this programs by a modern and user-friendly graphical user interface with all functions of a well integrated & kde; program.</seg>
<seg id="727">& graphs; is a KDE program for viewing & graphviz; -dot; -Graphical; -programs are free layout programs. & kgraphs; displays graphs with all the possibilities of a good integrated & kde; -program in a modern and user-friendly & GUI. it has the following functions:</seg>
<seg id="728">Integration in & Kate; and & Conqueror; (so that a change of Graphene in & Kate; Graphene new and graphs; represents)</seg>
<seg id="729">Menu to open the Graphene in & Kate; open the Graphene in & Kate; open in a & Kate; -Component</seg>
<seg id="730">Load large graphs (currently there are problems of about 1000 knots and a hack to present more than those nodes)</seg>
<seg id="731">Further required software: & kgraph; is a & kde; program that uses & graphviz; -tool & dot; for presentation of the Graphene. required in detail:</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window displays the opened graphics, each in a own subwindow. at the beginning, if you start & kgraphs; without an argument, the main window will only open the symbol file and the (empty) list Finally opened files. click on the first icon to open the dialog.</seg>
<seg id="733">After you have selected a or more & dot; -files selected, the main window looks like in the lower screen photo:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview on the corner is displayed if Graph is larger than the drawing area. you can select a fixed position of this review or select this position automatically.</seg>
<seg id="735">Using the mouse (high and below without special keys, left and right with pressed & Alt; -button);</seg>

<seg id="740">As with the last option, you can save your choice permanently, but also changing the dialog dialog.</seg>
<seg id="741">When program launch, you can open all graphics of your last session. again, you can save your choice of both save and later.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can also define how the Graph is to be split up to several pages. the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely elected.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you use multiple pages, you can choose whether the parts of the graphics card will be ignored on this page. if you keep the aspect ratio, the pages may not be filled out of the respective parts of the graph.</seg>

<seg id="751">The & neato; algorithm is the default for unequivocal graphics. he produces representations in accordance with the jump-model. thereby, the Kamada-Kawai algorithm is used, which is synonymous with statistical multilingual scaling.</seg>
<seg id="752">The & FDP; algorithm creates a jumping model layout for unequipping Graphene. it uses the frustrman-clean gold heuralism, and includes a multi-grid solver for the treatment of large and clustered graphs.</seg>
<seg id="753">The & circo; algorithm arranges the nodes into a circle under the description of Six und Tollis, 1999, and Kauffman and meadow, 2002. he is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cyclic structures.</seg>
<seg id="754">Open a dialog where you can specify a layouts which is then executed by a shell. the command should display graphs after stdout in xdot-format. with such a layout command you can give & eg; the & graphs; -algorithms special options, or change the graphs with a filter before it is drawn.</seg>

<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographic localization makes tools available to localize images geographically in the spherical coordinator system that is used by GPS and Galileo. height, longitudinal and latitude are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">In order to correlate your pictures with geographical data, you need a GPS trace as XML file in GPX format. gssbabel and gpsone you can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographical localization correlator. this interface can lead a number of previously selected images using a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate to the main window and call the menu. in order to run a possible correlation between time and localization, you have to download a track file containing GPX file. this file contains the same time at the same time, as images of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">When the file is loaded, the coordinates will be shown in red. GPS trace data are recorded in GMT times and therefore the camera-time will be done with the GMT time. this can be done with the time zone. place your camera zone here.</seg>
<seg id="815">The maximum deviation for the maximum period deviation is an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera period. the deviation is among them the data is summarized. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you do not have a track data of one place for pictures you can manually edit the GPX file and add to the images. the time difference of 2000 seconds will then be related to all pictures in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolishing and difference in minutes may be used if you do not have any matching data. if you know that in reality a local difference between camera and GPS lies, you can place this limits and then specify the button.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be manually set with this dialog. this is useful if you have a number of photos on the same place. since the dialog can use the coordinates of a call to the next article you will need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found with the displayed map and enlarge it. choose the concerned region and enlarge it. the height must always be selected manually. the card can always be manually selected. the card can always be changed between card mode, satellite image and a mixed mode.</seg>

<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Kodierer module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a dip.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG Kodierer module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video, with a defined length. this module uses the packets of Mjpegtools and ImageMagick. you can also add a basic image file in the MP2 or WAV of the slides.</seg>
<seg id="844">All pictures will be scaled automatically to the correct size for the selected video format. additionally, you can choose a background color for the dial. with this module, it is possible to create DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. finally, you can use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">First you have to be packed into the images that will be packed into the MPEG Diaschau. then you can start the module via extras MPEG Diaschau.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images that are selected by you are listed under image files in the portfolio. you can also change the images or contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should select the other settings. if you are using different formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. in case you are planning to select the appropriate TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is default and most probably the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step, you should specify the time in seconds to specify a picture. the speed of the image process is specified below. a low value creates very sudden, a high contrast with very smooth image changes.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set as next. in doubt, you should leave it black. the name and the path of the generated file can be found under the name of the MPEG-output file. keep the extension mpg.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you indicate an audio file under the name of the audio source file, you can start the movie into the movie. after all your computer you can start with the button. depending on your computer's speed you can now drink it quickly or in all the rest of your computer. if you have to enjoy a coffee, if you are back again.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a hint appears that codec or tools are missing, you can adjust the paths to the programs of Mjpegtools and ImageMagick packages to the right below.</seg>
<seg id="852">The printing assistant allows several pictures to print in standard photo sizes. the combined images can also be opened automatically with the image processing Gimp. this is useful to improve you or print using the Gimp module for direct expression.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module, you can import them to convert images in one of three formats to JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command line tool dcraw from Dave Coffin. an original case from Him is: expect from dcraw not that it generates the same results as the software from your camera manufacturers. sometimes you get better results with dcraw better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First choose the RAW file to convert and start the module. the Raw-Image Converter window appears in mode for a single image. with the button preview you can preview the effect of your current settings.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimize the converting process. the first option decides, if the camera settings are to be used for the White. the essential parameters such as Gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifier can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can further edit the picture later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected so you can use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch does not have effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">As soon as you are happy with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and the converting result remains the same and only the extension is adapted accordingly. JPEG uses a loss algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">Tagged image format, TIFF, reserves all information of your image and uses the lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you are frequently asked to process your pictures or later, you should not choose to use JPEG format, as it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality deteriorated. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you are using JPEG as a memory format, the metadata are stored in the JPEG file in the JPEG file in the EXIF data.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adapted your settings, you can start the conversion button. if you want to break this process again, then you can cancel the conversion.</seg>
<seg id="863">The pile-processing mode allows you to convert various images to one time. use this mode if you are safe, for example through testing on a single image that are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical with the version for single images. however, this is helpful if this is created in an earlier attempt. however, this is not available. the progress panel shows how far the conversion is advanced.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images in an album. it uses the convert of the image from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all images of an album. you can use the prefix, the starting number and timestamp of the timer.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a image collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can reduce the image or enlarge the image of the image change:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1): normal size change in a dimension. width or height of the image is automatically selected, depending on the image orientation, the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. here the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option to adjust your image to screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: this option is changed in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed in this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Print preparation: prepare the image for the photo pressure. the user can set the printing resolution and size of the photo paper. the target image, including background size, boundary size and background color, is adapted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module, you can send chosen images with your favorite E-mail program. it is also possible to amend the size of the given pictures before. additional pictures can be accessed from the list of the images.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you have launched the module, the window window will be displayed by you with a file selection dialog. you can add more images using a file selection dialog. for the last displayed image, a preview can be displayed on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also draw pictures on the picture list and add it to the list of the selected images.</seg>
<seg id="875">The pictures will be removed from the list of the selected images from the list of the selected images.</seg>
<seg id="876">After you have selected all pictures you can open the new news window of your e-mail clients. you have to add the addresses and the subject. you have to add the addresses and add the subject.</seg>
<seg id="877">Do not pay attention to many photos at one time. most e-mail accounts have limitations for the size of the immediate e-mails. it is possibly a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window will be used to change the settings for the images of the images. their configuration is stored and changed every time again until you change it.</seg>

<seg id="918">Before HTML pages will need to make some settings. these are divided into the three areas of content, layout and goal. in the following purposes, each range is described.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the transferring and a description that should contain the HTML file later. on a blank Album; HTML sample Pages you can see an example for this settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, choose whether a & DVD album; -export file is to be created on the review page, you will find further information about export files.</seg>
<seg id="921">Lastly, you can select which information is displayed on the HTML pages. for example, you can avoid that information is displayed by a party. note that all pictures have been exported without explanation. for example, all pictures have been exported. you can not use this setting to hide specific pictures before certain viewer.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this area, you can define how the HTML pages should look like. most of the installation options are clearly written, which is not specifically received.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images. this allows those to view your website and supports a monitor that supports maximum resolution 800x600, for example a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">At any time, the viewer can change the dissolution at any time you have set the resolution at any time. it can display your pictures with low resolution, what to achieve a lower transmission time, it changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting area, place the various folder and the URL where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">Best select for all your HTML files a basic folder and for any subsequent set a new subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="927">First you need to select the main folder where all your pictures will be stored. this folder will be saved and automatically added to the next time. thus, you can select either a folder or from KDE supported protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your pictures, you can check if you select all of the viewer. if you have created a web browser after the pages have been created, the URL you should specify here. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong file.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files created from you are not yet in the final target folder you need to specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base file in which all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The just described installation options have changed all three on basic folders or URLs. in these, a subfolder is created, whose name can be found in the output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are interested in a family party, a conference or somewhere else, with other users from & to a album; you may, of course you want to create a HTML page for viewing the images. however, you may have a lot of time to apply to the pictures, recording place, etc., then you have to put back with & hay album; this work will not even make it once more.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & D album; you can export a copy of your pictures to a .kim file. these can import other into your database and import them with ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ as if the pictures are stored in the file or whether the images can be saved in file. the advantage of all images in the file is that you can set aside all the images and this file is so independent. the obvious advantage is however the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can select a .kim file directly from the menu file exporting... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file together with a HTML file, this is an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file is looking for images on two way. first, the images are not found in the folder of .kim file. if the images of the URL, you are searched for creating the HTML files, this is naturally only possible if you have created your .kim file using HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">The following will be described in the dialog for exporting images that you can edit over the menu file...</seg>
<seg id="937">The main option of this dialog box is whether it is an internal or external .kim -files. there are three options available to you:</seg>
<seg id="938">If you want to copy the .kim-file, copy the images to the same folder as the .kim file copy.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the Automatically, copy the .kim-file, copy & DVD Album; the Images automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. since most pictures have been compressed to JPEG and the XML file itself is very small it is usually not compress the files. if you want to compress this, simply select the option export file.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this site is maximum image size. if you want to send your friends images, you would not want to limit the pictures, as the .kim file would be very big. here you can say the size that each picture should be 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file using file extension .kim from the web browser or from the menu file importing... select, it will be released & are released to import exporting database as described in.</seg>
<seg id="943">The Assistant for importing consists of four steps. first, you need to select what images you want to import, in which folder you want to import pictures.</seg>
<seg id="944">It can be that you should know the category people of the imported file (if you're a chips), while this category is called for your database. therefore, you will be imported in the third dialog window, which are to be imported into your database for these categories.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step, you can compare the categories of the file to imported file with the categories of your present database. one example is on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It must be easy to browse pictures and view: if you see images, you often want to view images within various picture groups & mdash; if you see pictures of your Italy vacation, you might want to see a picture with your friend you would like to see all the pictures on which this friend can see.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual, you will find the various steps from (1) fixed the information about your pictures, via (2) the search and watching, up to (3) advanced issues and adaptability.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoAlbum was started as a program to manage your images. but it has been extended and today cares your videos. at many places this manual is spoken about pictures, but often does this also include videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& double album; stores all of its information in the index.xml in the top file of their images. this is a simple XML file which you can copy to a program of your choice, e.g. Normal backup tools, copy to a disk or revisions in CVS, where you want to order.</seg>
<seg id="950">& khew album; remembers the folder where your pictures are stored and used this when you want to start a different database with pictures, you can start a different folder with pictures, you can start & hay album; with the -c option -c ~ / company / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">In addition to the menu entry adjustments, you can get... get to a window, with which you can change the settings of & can album; in the following section of the user interface you will be explained the various setup possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you can see six different symbols, with which you can call setting up the preview and options for the viewer. for each setting, a detailed help is available that can be accessed by a button on the F1 button and click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">In fact, as you can define different features for each picture of different features, such as people, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">On view the dialog box is used to process already existing groups. for each group you can select a label and symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section subcategories were already mentioned. in the dialog, you can setup complete list groups, i.e. all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a central glides as explained in.</seg>

<seg id="957">& Texan album; shares his modular system with other graphics applications such as digiplug-in and gwenview. this modulus system is KIPI and means & kde; image plugin interface. nly information refer to the homepage of Kipi.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be called on the menu modules. the modules can not be described and are distributed in this manual, as they are not sold separately from & Ds, but most modules have a help page that you can call on the modules itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules can be used together with several applications together, it can always test that the modules are always tested with the demo database before you can use them using the command &gt; kola Album -Demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the menu help. do not say, I wouldn't have been warned!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use the modules via KIPI are very different, so that it can be very different, so that some modules can't work with & discs; this is the disadvantage when you share functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The largest difference between & cold Album; and other applications that can also use KIPI, is that the other applications are not supported in albums; this type of order is not supported, simulates the order for some modules, so that you can use the functions with & a model album.</seg>
<seg id="962">There are simulated & hitting album; the current album, which is simply the current viewpoint, so all pictures that show you the picture look at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="963">Besides the latest album, & kreleased album; the modules also have a list of albums. this is going to be released and will be released, as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & movies are album; s browser shows the contents of a category, for example, all persons, then each entry in this category is a album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will be the category that you have set in the setup dialog as a category for virtual albums, so if you're using the category people, we will do & get album; so do if you have selected to view people and to the module this.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & D album; not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. start to install the setup dialog, and select in the range of modules that modules should be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example for a start screen, once you are & are released, with your own pictures.</seg>

<seg id="969">One of the main features of & kates album; is the possibility to see any picture with notes where the image has been recorded, etc. you can use each image either individually or for a larger number of images certain notes simultaneously. if for example, on all pictures of Jesper is recorded and all pictures taken in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All of these notes can be used for searching and browsers as you can read in the section. if you want to see this remarks if you are using the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">In case you can see three lists with a text box by adding people, places and words. these are a very important part of & cold album; because you can always use them again when you enter information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is based on shifting the pictures within the list: if you are for example a family party and are shown on all 50 pictures the same 5-10 people, you can find that the names mentioned above are moved up quickly and arrange them.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to receive a alphabetical order list, click on the icon for sorting after date under the list.</seg>

<seg id="1025">Each object has an illumination level. you can specify this value relative to visual level of object or as an absolute value. objects are displayed only if they are selected or their vision level smaller or equal to the scene choice of the scene of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovegeler, has a window order as default. the object-tree and the view of the object characteristics are shown on the left and the four graphical views of the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you do not like the standard window order, or if you need a different arrangement, you can save them as desired. you can also save multiple windows orders and change it between different arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1028">In order to set a window over or below a available view, drag the facade to the upper or bottom edge of a view. a rectangle shows the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, go on the right or left side of a view. the new view will then be anchored on the right or left side of this view and covers the overall height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you would like to arrange multiple views on each other, drag the mountings in the middle of a different view. you can then switch between the views by clicking on the card reader at the top in the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window order are floating views: views, which are not anchored in the main window. in order to solve a view from the anchor, drag the desktop on the right arrow or click on the small arrow pointing to the left arrow.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To view a view, click on the small cross in the facade bar. to prevent the closing, click on the small square between the arrow and the cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can add additional views to the main window. in the menu view, you can find entries for any type of views. new views are floating, you can stack them on any spot.</seg>
<seg id="1034">The current window view can save a window of window. save a dialog box is displayed in which you can save the window regulations under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you have produced a scene, you can render it. & kpovegeler; 3.1g for renders, this program has to be installed properly. as this manual was written, & Povray; 3.5 currently. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0 is not supported.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene, click on the symbol Rendering Symbol Renders in the tool bar or select the menu entry of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A Render-mode corresponds to entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and quality of the rendering. if you want to insert a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can add any number of Excel modes, from a fast preview of up to full images in highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the icon The Render settings in the tool bar or select menu setting..., the following dialog will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each Render Mode has a name. you can enter any name, but sense is a name that can recognize the features of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the map size you can do the width and height of the rounded image. if you want to render only a small area of the image, select the check box below and give the image section to renders in the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In combination-field quality you can choose the properties that use & Povray; this is used by a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diffuser reflection light. a detailed description of the Render features can be found in the user manual & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture with only a beam per pixel you can create different errors. these pictures often have a moirè pattern or batch effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technology called anti-aliasing to decrease the influence of this error. generally pictures are better with this feature better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">When you turn off Anti-aliasing, calculates & connects & Povray; more than a beam per pixel. this technique is called super sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super sampling. as a standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the second method is adaptive-recursive; recursive because each pixels is subduously split and adaptive because the detection depth are depending on the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, POV-Ray has a beam per pixel. if the difference between the color values to the neighboring pixel are processed, a grid of 4x4 additional points will be charged, a grid of 4x4 additional points will be charged, at a depth of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r. 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays each pixel. if the difference is divided between the color values, then the pixels is divided into 4 subpixels that can be checked separately and on additional subdivision. the maximum depth of the record allows you to adjust with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another possibility to reduce aliasing effect is the generation of noise for the beam process called Jittering. if you place Jittering, changing & Povray; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular samples.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for quality of the renderns is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental feature of & Povray; the diffuse light reflectance is calculated. it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this feature.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this card card you can adjust if the alpha-channels are to be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent if the corresponding illuminants have no object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for displaying & Povray; console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly, you can find the reason why.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray; -Scene scene, select the menu entry file importing... and select a file in the dialog window.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently, & kpovegeler does not support the full command line of & Povray; when importing error messages or warnings, a dialog window displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not support source code in & kpovmodeler, write this source code between the two special comments / / * PMRawkin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object tree into the editor to import the source text file into the editor. to import objects into the scene, select the source code in the editor and drag it to the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">Copying and inserting into & kpovmodeler, and in your editor you can also insert sources for & Povray; also in your editor.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called if & kpovegeler is running. usually this is povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">When you click on the own image view, click & kpovegeler; the & Povray; user documentation on the displayed object. set up the path to your document's retention and version 1. it supports versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (e.g. altiring data) in the paths to & Povray; -libraries. if you enter files that are not in the folder of the scene, you must also enter the path to these files here, if a file is used in different paths of the library, the first spotted file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for wire-models. the second color is used to display the selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the control points. the second color is used for displaying the selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The colour of rectangle in the camera view and in the window type markings.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the object of objects on the grid in the context menu of the wire-model views. you can set the grid separately for shifts, scaling and tortures.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values indicate an accurate wire model and thus a better sewing unit for the displayed objects, but require more time to renders. for some objects like the ball you can set the detail level for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you cross the high detail shots for extended projections, all wire-model views are further divided, all projections are using the perspective and the vertical projections. this property gives a better approach to projections, but requires more time to rendering.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you cross the wall, a wall is mounted behind the objects. the wall is depicted in a chboard pattern with two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1069">If you cross the bottom, a floor is placed below the objects. the floor is depicted in a chboard pattern with two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you check in canons, the non-recursive antialiasing method is used for the Rendering of the scenes. values for depth and swelling can be set. precise information about the parameters you will find in section Render modes.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this site, you can modify the existing window arrangements or create new window arrangements in the window accounts, how to create and store window arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The Combination field Standard Window System: displays all existing window arrangements. & kpovmodeler; the chosen window order is used during the start of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of limiting window orders shows all existing window arrangements. a new arrangement can be created with the button and delete a selected arrangement with the button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Any window order is identified by the name. the name must be unique and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list below the name shows all the views of the chosen window order. new views can create and delete selected views with the button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with new column you create a new column on the right-hand side of the existing window, with incorrect card, you will receive a cartridge card on the right pane and webbing the view not in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you have just & Povray; and & kpovegeler is installed and now you would like to start more accurate knowledge of both programs. if you can follow all steps in this guide, you should have the ultimate way to create simple scene capturing very popular: a sphere on a plane.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should keep following warnings carefully before you complain about that you get as a result only a black screen. if you use a 3D program, you should see these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do no camera, no rules can be applied for the rendering, as a result you get a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you don't include any light sources, your whole scene is in the dark and you will get just a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have any fault-free installed, you will see at the first start of & kpovmodeler, the following preset window mapping:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to know the menus and the existing symbols of the tool bar. read the documentation that you can expect a reasonable show what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">They are often used to use these menus and symbols now, therefore you should remember the menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovegeler; starts with a simple scene. in order to remove this guide, you must first remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then choose the menu entry. so you now have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene you generate. in particular, note that in the fourth wire model view (right below), this is the view of the scene from the viewpoint of the camera. this shows you the result of the scene of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the designation camera. if you click on it, see the content of the view object Properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found. in the user documentation & Povray; you will find further details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change anything at the basic settings of the camera, this is later instructions reserved, but note that the camera to change control points. simply click with the left mouse button on a control point, and drag him to the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="1088">If you press the button on the user or the input buttons, the wire-model views and the object tree immediately change this settings. as a result, they see the scene from the viewpoint of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the floor for the scene. you might set a Quader (insertion body torader) and size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100 but this is a smooth approach to solve this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovegeler is actually a simple way. you can use an infinite level as the ground:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: choose the plane in the object tree, change the name and press the button on the or the type. in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model view is also displayed at the moment, even at the moment only as a limited level. if you renders the scene, the plane extends up to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you can see the object tree exactly, you can see the default options for each new object. in this case, you will find only the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation, and move. select one of these options, change the possible settings in the view of the object characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene, you should move the floor to exercise a unit under the line, just to know some of these parameters. choose shift and set values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First choose the floor to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but choose a little bit simple at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases a dialog box opens in which you may choose to insert how the object is inserted. you can change the name in the self-image view (name = bottom pigment), with a click on the button preview you see how the pigment looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course the preview of the pigments only shows a flat black material, because you can always have settings for the pigment even. do you always remember to check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview. also, there are many possibilities for the pigment. however, there are many possibilities now, but now take the easiest.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you do not see any color on Quilt and ball in the preview, click the button on the user and then call the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now set correctly. if you render your image with one click on the symbol, you should obtain the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, these are not the colour. you need to enter two new attributes. in the color list you need two new attributes. then you can do this entry twice (you can do this also more often, but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">Choose object-tree every time and change the colors in the view of the object Properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">This step, you should already be able to run, as you've already understood the general operation of & kpovmodeler, the ball can be just as easy as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object properties you can change the settings immediately. set the value for the radius: on 1 (don't forget the input on the floor) so that the ball is poured out over the ground as you have moved the floor to a unit downwards.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, the Rendering is now a self-featured result: as already before, the ball surface appears like a matt black material. set the following steps a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the ball, you can now add a material. as in the ground, insert the ball a pigment as color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">First, choose the subject and change the name for example in the ball pigment. click on ball pigment, then dial colour and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can reach more interesting effects if you take the time, to set some finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values like in the following screen photos and click on users or press the type of input.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The brightness of shine effect and reflection have already some good visual effects, perfect for glass or chrome finish, even if metal is not selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of what ways to give you & kpovmodeler. hopefully, you have already learned as much as you can create simple but nice scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracycing is a Render Method to create a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene or a model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">When you raytracing a Scraytracts from the perspective of the viewer (i.e. from the camera that reflects the scenes) by each pixel in the scene. the calculated effects of the light sources in the scene and as the atmospheric effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects can be handled as an example of fog.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you will see without a camera, the camera is your eye to view the scene. without a light source, you can also see anything, the picture is simply black. obviously, any scene, which should be germapped, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In common file dialog, you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the default file dialog, you can select a file that you have created before using & kpovmodeler</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open a new model or create, the file is inserted into this sub-menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model, it is stored under the same name. if it is a new file, you need to enter a name and a disk space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">The scene in the last stored version is reproduced. all changes since the last storage are rejected.</seg>
<seg id="1119">You can only select this menu entry if you do not have any stored changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the last reverse order. this menu entry allows you to select only if you have used to work on the reverse.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Saves the current windings and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or an existing arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu, you will find options for setting & kpovmodeler, here you can change the look, the keyboards and default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog for changing the shortcut. you can change or add commands to use this option for & kpovmodeler; -Commands or adding new commands.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog for setting up the tool bar. you can add and remove the tool symbols for & kpovmodeler.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A dump map is an option to furnish rough surfaces without changing any hives on the surface without changing the geometrical form of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is customary to use the same file for both a Bump Map and also for a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are produced from dozens of or even hundreds of these basic bodies. these models are then processed, to give them a realistic appearance.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis, by using an image file as color chart.</seg>

<seg id="1183">The DCOP interface of Amarok has many general functions, mostly in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and should describe the DCOP-functions of collection, context-browser, players, playlist, playlist for the DCOP-function break might look & zb; look like this:</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok also supports command line options of Qt and & kde; Amarok also has some own command line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user a feedback if the script can not be done because of a missing dependency. please check in your script, whether all required modules are present and check the dialog for allowing users to know why a script does not running.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Begin require 'Rescue LoadError error =' Corundum '(KDE bindings for ruby) from kdebindings V3.4 is set for this script.' endialog --sorry '# {error}' 'exit</seg>
<seg id="1187">In the file scripts / templates you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use them as a base for your own scripts, or simply expand the required functions. they will quickly find that the writing of scripts is relatively simple.</seg>
<seg id="1188">Using DCOP, your scripts can be exchanged with Amarok and controls Amarok. the easiest way is the use of command dcop; which should be bending with every KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripts are able to execute external programs and commands. additionally, the function exec () is used in this way, dcop &gt; is relatively easy to be called. here is an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& amway; sends alerts to all running scripts. in this reason, scripts are obliged to monitor the default scripts and react according to events. of course, a script may ignore the events even if it has no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure the script to indicate the setup dialog. in order to store the saving and loading of the setup data, Amarok relies the folder to the folder where all data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange Signalizes that a new piece is played. the script could now retrieve & zb; with DCOP features further information about the new piece (for example, the metadata or the unit length).</seg>
<seg id="1193">VolumetChange newVolume signalizes a change of volume. the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Customizucked: submenu, Contains the path to the selected files of playlist, if set a custom menu entry, you can use the DCOP-function dcop amperscript script MenuItem (Submenu itemTitle). in order to remove one entry, you can use dcop amway script conditions. eCustomMenuItem (Submenu itemTitle).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & when the user is terminated; or if the user stops a script, sends & amarok; the signal SIGTERM will be able to do the script. this signal should be processed to do. for example, the saving of data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script administration can also install script packages which can be compressed using a web server. such packets are basically normal Tar Archive (.tar), which can be optionally detected with bzip2 (.bz2), that the user can clearly recognize the archive as a Amarok script package.</seg>
<seg id="1197">& amarok; 1.3 will only accept script packets with the extension of amarokscript. for this reason you should use your script packages equal right.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main crept must be executable (+ x), the remaining to loading modules should not be increased. use the Tsar parameter -p to get the file right:</seg>

<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP interface of & K3b; provides functions such as copyCD, format DVD and further functions for creating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">DCOPRef createMovixCDProject () DCOPRef createMovixCDProject () DCOPRef createMovixCDProject () DCOPRef createMovixCDProject () DCOPRef createMovixCDProject () DCOPRef createMovixCDProject () Specialist Cdrw (), Burnddimage (KURL url), burndvdimage (KURL url)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result such a createXXXproject method, you can produce a DCOP-reference to the newly created project: # K3b --audiocd and then a reference to the project using # dcop K3b K3bInterface currentProject. using this reference it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the above-listed K3bProjectinterface and the powerful K3bDataProjectInterface, which can only be used on data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">The createFolder (QString Name), createFolder (QString Name, QString Parent), addurl (KURL:: List URLs, QString Parent), the eItem (QString path), renameItem (QString path, QString newName).</seg>
<seg id="1492">This makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, multiple folders and then add files into the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop K3b K3b) dcop $PROJECT createFolder grao dcop $PROJECT createFolder bar / foo dcop $PROJECT addateFolder / foo dcop $PROJECT addateFolder / foo / home / trueg / set file.txt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& audiocreator; is an audio CD; runs for & kde; with it you can easily read audio CD; s can be read and stored in MP3 or OGG files. other formats are possible, depending on the encoder that is installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& audiocreator; is the user interface of cdparanoia (for the reading of & CD; -data in WAV files on the hard drive) and from many Kodiers, which are currently supported for MP3, oggenc for OGGs and FLAC (this codec packages must still be added from the Linux distribution). additional codec can be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First the title of the & CD will be read and stored in WAV files on the computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step, these WAV files are generally compressed into MP3 or OGG format, or in other formats like the lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD; it is compiled by & audiocreator; cdparanoia. almost any distribution has compiled a precompiled package; if this is not yet installed, this has to be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step is lame (for MP3), oggprebis (for OGG) or other codec. all these programs are already installed for any Linux distributions that are not necessary to compile it. however, if FLAC is not used, the installation will not be required.</seg>
<seg id="1500">What encoding / file format should be used? the chapter catcher codec is a small introduction to codec, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word to copy protected audio CD; s: as already said, used & audiocreator; cdparanoia, to read the audio data from the & CD; this program is not possible to avoid any copy protection. in any case & audiocreator; even avoid the mechanisms of copy protection. avoid simply the purchase of copy protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While inserting only once (the setup dialog can be found so often up to a suitable configuration), it will be explained by daily handling to read a & CD; this leads (hopefully) to facilitate the slim approach of the user interface, which you will be proud in the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert in many formats - depending on which coding programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can record & CD; retrieve the freedb from the internet or can fully work completely without network, whereby everything is recorded manually.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is just a brief list of the commands of the main window. on the page step by step, you will find more information on how this program is used as well as screens with descriptions of the tab for the configuration of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">The CDDB request of the CD data is based on request by the CDDB tab. (this can be locally or online, in the latter case must first be connected to the Internet.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Start reading and - if a encoder is configured in the encoding parameter settings in the setup code - the coding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">A sub-menu opens with a list of available encoder, so that the selection of any other encoder can be read as default. it is noted that before the encoder is configured in the tab dialog box dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the file manager, allowing a already read file to encode instead of a complete & CD; read and encode.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the instruction dialog for configuring the notifications (such as protocols, pieptics) for programming (such as reading & CD; terminated).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main setup dialog of & kaudiocreator; with various cartridge cards (such as Encoder, to set the Encoders). here you need to go before the program can successfully be used!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, codec and compression ratios and helps you choose the right body.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, there is no loss-free audio format. besides FLAC, there are also other such as' hormone 'or' Monkey ', which may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression ratios and barely available commercial devices that can play this files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats supported by data compress according to their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG may today have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above this bitrate the differences are less important because both coders produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'n'nso 'free, lame is still delivered with most distributions of free, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high up to very high sound quality (with high bitrates), but compared to OGG slightly lower quality with deeper bitterness.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG players are available.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - When music is also heard on other devices such as standard DVD player, portable devices (USB Stick, memory card, hard drive) or special Auto-stereo systems. today - at the beginning of 2009 these devices only support MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list with parameters to audio quality and resulting compression ratios for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for other parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting provides good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This option should usually offer good transparency for most people and most of the music pieces acceptable, and has quite high quality. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. needs always 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a titels. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR Communal stereo, compression rate of approx. 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a titels. good enough for music of young people, portable devices and car travel systems. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Fane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting is exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you have absolutely the absolutely highest quality, then choose this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; written manually, or by the program automatically generated from the freedb over the Internet, are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can pass / used with & audiocreator; and the codification program to generate the folder and file names and the characteristics of music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with Kodierections, there are often a combination of program settings for the coding and these parameters here. the manual or aid to the codiers explain the switch for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example, to add the & CD; titles to the Keywords (English: day) add to MP3s with lame, the switch is to be added by lame and title parameters of & audiocreator; the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & audiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button name in the assistant):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freedb is: a free database to download the information up / enter, so that all other information can be downloaded on the calculator. it is too note that this text is spoken only by Text: & CD; title, artist, name of the pieces & etc;, not by the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (default) is not attorney. however, no one can prevent the information on the & CD; and there is also the information without the & CD; it can neither be added to the artist nor the music company. all information can be done by a bypass through a & CD; business, physically or virtuell.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & audiocreator; is active as a check box (sending an address) to use one another (counterfeit) address than those used in the system. in this type of configuration, it seems, however, the e-mail address is not used when using the server (this can only know the programmer to check the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are many countries copies from the main database. if & audiocreator; for use of freedb, the geographic at the next recumbent server will be used, this saves bandwidth in the network and compensates the load between the machines.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org delivers a current list of mirrors for online retrieval of & CD; information while reading a & CD; alternatively, the entire database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the updates of database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which readout program is used to store pieces from the & CD; save in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumors that it is used to know more detailed, searching in the source code.... This was always the best choice for watching audio CD; s. note that the cdparanoia package from the appropriate distribution must be installed first if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="1537">For saving the stored WAV files can be selected the codec and therefore select the desired file format. in the first opening, predefined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a lossless compressing for audio data) can be added to the encoding of the body. other codec can be added to this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Kodierer package must be installed from the current Linux distribution before the codec can be used. this is also necessary for predefined codec. more information about codec are in the chapter catcher codec.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a Kodierers, more information about the switch can be obtained via the input of a command like lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console). it must be replaced by the name of the installed Kodierers.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many reasons. check the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, the writing and readers of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, FLAC & etc;) are installed. try both programs with a command line in a terminal. that could be a note that is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you do not want to read a copy protected audio CD; check out the case of & CD; this will not work too!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step for example. even if you use other settings, this will give you how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Did you read the complete manual, everything understood, but are still unsafe what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you'll get enough information to set up those areas that you want to make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, all setup and our first & CD. we'll use lame '--preset extreme' to create MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3v1 samples (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">There are cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be found as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can be found for example with a search engine, as it is not completely free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which can of course always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please ensure that the directory / usr / share / cd insists and that you own write permission (eg; by trying to copy the cross-queror a bit).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic set of & audiocreator; something probably is done only once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes this approach to read out a & CD; what needs to be repeated for every issuing & CD; to be repeated.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the used codec for compression of music (lame) and the audio format (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps), it is determined where the files are saved and what structure is used. since we are lazy, we divide the program to download the freedb and download the data from the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change this settings at any time, we will probably not be able to read any & CD at any time, if the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is presented to the reader program to read the & CD; data / pieces can be read.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive. if this is not working or if more than a & CD; / DVD drive can also be specified, a look at the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the available entries of the device designations for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The map general settings. here you don't need to do much. here, a additional transformation can be defined here. in our example, everything will be shown as shown / entered as shown in screen photo.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only for incomplete information, so that you will be informed when using keywords (tags) are missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card CD; -Settings. simply select both entries. we are convenient and leave the & CD; data automatically download via the Internet from a freedb computer.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected during the reading of the & CD; it can be connected to the Internet so that it can access the freedb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection field is simple, a & CD; it is displayed immediately, if you are unhappy with the database entry and the resulting directories names / filename or tag entries, you can change it easily. the directory or record name will be changed using convection - &gt; umrename and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example it is further to note: if you want to manually enter the select fields and freedb. however, this is about 620 MB large, superior to whether it is worth it. to freedb in open mode, the two selection fields must be selected, at least the first. mode is set up on the following map card.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is for us freedb. these are settings for the data request, for retrieval the & CD; information from the freedb server about the Internet. how to get the system that data will get the CD? read the section on freedb. set everything as shown in screen photo.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we don't download the database, we want to work only with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to the site freedb.org and look after a mirror server in your vicinity. on this way the load is distributed between the machines. however, this setting is likely to work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both works equal to the server, because many firewalls will drive the protocol 8880, there is perhaps more luck with the protocol 80 because the & HTTP; protocol usually open to surf the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we want to transmit no & CD; data to the freedb servers should be sufficient. the first check box should be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Simply take the settings of screen photo. (make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneous pieces: excuse, is there any reason why more than one at one time when using existing drive? parallel reading and encode? the author doesn't know it itself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after reading the last piece: cross this to the & CD; at the end of the trial.</seg>
<seg id="1567">User-defined file for temporary files: if you cross this crucifix, then the path / folders can be checked, if only space on another drive is available. does not forget to make files in private folders. do not forget this folder when you want to make something with WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">All of this way enter as it is on screen photo. the command is something long, under circumstances should be blown to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of MP3s. as previously mentioned, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good HiFi stereo systems. the resulting bitrate is about 224 - 256 kg.. it achieved compression factor 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the record '--id3v1-only' for the limitation of tags on version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2 'tags can be deleted as needed. Kid3 is an excellent' id3 'tagger for & kde; in case of later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the names of the input file (including the complete path) and output file (including the complete path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Use the rest as in screen photo. some comments for future use outside this sample:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneously encoded WAV files: with a Dualcore or Quadcore or even a multi-processor machine can be tried to encode more than a WAV file simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1573">This is, we have just finished the basic device of & audiocreator; this configuration is used as standard for each reading of a & CD; if you chose the organisational structure of your music smart, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section it is described, as the process of the reading of the & CD is described. we will create MP3 files. first, a connection to the internet is built. first, a connection to the internet is built, as we are convenient and the & CD; data from freedb is needed. the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each issuing & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD which is not included in freedb, the screen photos will see a bit differently than those for a & CD; you will learn how to manually enter the & CD, instead of taking them from the Internet. comments are to be displayed on the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Try not to find the & CD; this example is a 'special' edition of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not yet done, the & CD must now be defined in the drive which was defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and its length should be listed in the window, as in screen photo. this only if the & CD; as audio CD; could be identified and identified by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this is not done, then look for questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD; successfully collected by the freedb, all tracks of the pieces have already been completed and additionally the name of the artist and the album are shown.</seg>
<seg id="1581">For the case it is more than an entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; Key to your & CD; provides a window, and you can select the database entry, which your opinion is best to your & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you don't have chosen the check box for the automatic query of freedb (on the page & CD; you can also manually trigger the option of the first button in toolbar. if you don't have any local database, but you will need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 Step 02: the CD Editor - input of CD data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screen photo. the title of the piece in the first row of the 'Update title', the rest of the data in the input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist does not have to be entered into the input field "Update title" unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower commentary box can be used for the individual comments of inidiplell per piece, the commentary box of the album is used for comments that are valid for all the pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after successful retrieve of the data from the freedb the CD-editor is not empty, but it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD-editor (e.g. if all the words are beginning or not...) but also to check if there are any unwanted remarks.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we use only ID3v1 tags. this is limited to the length of the fields below 30 characters for the commentary, album and titles of a piece and at least 28 characters for the commentary volume. if you use ID3v2 tags, you have set up unlimited field length, at least regarding the tab setting settings; take a look at the tab 'basic settings'.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the day information of the generated files anytime with tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags will not support from all codes or file formats. see the Help to the Counter to obtain more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry that is obvious in the style of the expressive CD. in this example it is not important because we don't want the & CD. for more information, see the website of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example will be found under rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK' go back to the main window. click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD-Editors appears again and you see that fields for the album are already filled with the entered data we have recorded for the first piece. enter the entries for the fields of the current piece. enter the title of the piece for any case and other information you wish.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and process the same way until you have entered all the title data of the & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window appears not if you have downloaded the data from freedb. it is already sorted into one of these categories in the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the tool bar. note that the artist and the album can be displayed on the product list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check-sign in front of each line of a piece. just a simple click on the line switches the choice of a piece or out. make sure all the items select at the bottom edge of the screen to choose all pieces at one time.</seg>
<seg id="1598">Was launched by clicking on the button selection, this window appears to confirmation. click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what is going on.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the riders orders for switching on the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, directly under the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window for control of orders. the first piece is just read on the hard drive. the status of the program is displayed in the left part of the window in the status line.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message you see if you're trying to work with a codec you have not yet installed. pieces that have not been successfully coded with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the tmp file and the target folders are not what we have entered here in the example. have you checked if you have a write access to the folder for temporary files and the target folders?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear how the error occurred right after the end of the balance of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: order 4 is the coding of piece 1 into the format MP3. that you can read and cooperate in parallel. note the status information at the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has no configuration settings to suppress this behaviour. the only thing configurable is that the number of parallel processes is unclear. the machine used with a AMD64 does not seem to have a problem during simultaneous operation and encode (of however two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read out, while another piece is coded and a third order is encoded on the waiting-long of the body. after the last piece is coded, a small window will end with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & audiocreator;, you will need & kde; 3.x or 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to generate compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG, you will need the coding of your choice.</seg>

<seg id="1630">The Leertaste has two tasks: if a piece is played, a pressure on the button pause or select the menu entry in the menu appears, so the playback is played during no piece when playing, starts & kmid; playback is played.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be saved on two ways in a piece of music. some pieces use texsurgeon and others use lyrics and again others. some pieces have no text: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid; you can adjust what events are displayed automatically and even better: the event type will automatically be selected, so you will not adjust anything manually. if you have chosen nothing manually, the karaoke text will automatically be selected, but you still have the opportunity to change this if you want to see the other kind.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to adjust the event of the event, select the items of textures or songings from the menu. the same function also have the keys 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files that you can summarized. these are played by the series after playing. in this section, how to use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. you will find the collection in the menu collection under the point of Organize.... Click there on New and give the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy a existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs like the original.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than a collection, you can set the data required in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">In the temporary collection all songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When leaving the application this collection is not stored. consider that if you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it must be selected in the collection manager. there you can add a song by adding a song. again, it appears again the file dialog with which help you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on the setting of automatic adding to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic adding to the collection is activated, a piece when opening (using file opening or drag & drop) will be added automatically for the active collection.</seg>
<seg id="1643">When automatic add to the collection is not activated, the collection will be activated and emptied the temporary collection. this collection will then be added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you must open the collection manager, select the collection and select the desired song and then click on.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played. if you pick up the series from the sub-menu sequence of the menu, the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add songs or remove random order in the menu, the order will be reset.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager or use the selection list on the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To jump to a song, select the next song, the entry next song from the menu or press the arrow on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump back a song, select the previous piece, the previous piece from the menu or press the arrow on the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select there the collection and click on the button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">Temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, that doesn't matter, since it is not saved when leaving & kmid; not stored.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizer, which are not General-MIDI-capable. in this case the MIDI-Map General-MIDI events in events that understands synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map, which converts all events of the change patch to Bright Piano in events of the change patch to Trumpet and thus makes it a trumpet, if originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you have a soundcard, you don't need MIDI map because all sound cards are GM-compatible (including Awe and GUS cards, FM radio devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There are unfortunately no programs to create MIDI maps, so you need to edit the appropriate file by hand (with your favorite ditor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI map is a text file that stores all required conditions for playback of a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section can only appear once, except the KEYMAP section, which may appear so often as desired. for this, however, every appearance has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END define KEYMAP "name of Keymap"... END define KEYMAP "An additional Keymap..." END define CHANNELMAP... END options... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that it is needed to indicate that a section starts (except for options) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your Map file as e-mail, that I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support can be used for devices that are not general-MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section, as the patches from General MIDI to your specific keyboard are shown. the general use looks as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the text sign will be ignored. it is believed that the GM Patches are in the right sequence (from 0 to 127), you may not change the order, and no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllkeysTo M is used to place all sounds which support this instrument using the number M (GM-Patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which is similar to a defamation suit. do not wear the following in the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So when now a MIDI file is to play a note with Patch 127 (defences), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the tone 60, regardless of which tone is available in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here with the concept drum-patch of the patch is meant, with each tone a different perkussioninstrument (drum, tank, maracas & etc;), and not the one that means the sound height of the same drum (like him some keyboards).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is used to specify how sounds are mapped on a specific channel or instrument.</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the order of lines is very important, as their presence. you must create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several keaps for each channel and any instrument you need to use different names in the first row.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are mainly used to build tones on the perkussions channel. look at an example of the supplied Keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to convert some channels to others. if you want to exchange the first and second channel, make it easy in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are useful for keyboards which have the percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI to Channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices require 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel, which is shown on the channel N, if you use the keymap option, of course to use the keymap option, of course you will ignore all events that try to change the patch on this channel. in this case you will always use Patch x.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful for example to use the perkussions patch on the perkussions channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBender ratio will be multiplied, in which proportion of pitch-Bender event is multiplied by the value n, this is used to be used with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then only forwarded. the value 4096 is used so that in the map file does not appear decimal number.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is used because GM is able to play a pitch-label event with the value 4096, to play a tone higher. unfortunately, try some keyboards to play at a octave up to play. in order to try the right value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid; try out.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, simply open the dialog for MIDI settings. this can be found in the menu under settings, point MIDI settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of keyboard (one for every MIDI channel). on these clavies you see which sounds are just played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel you can select a selection list, if you have changed a instrument, does not lights green but red to indicate that the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has (until now) two different views to display the played tones. view in the menu Settings under the point Channel View: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The speed LCD displays the speed, which is played with a song. the higher the number, the higher the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the pace of a song. if you can find a song be too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the pace, use the arrows to the left and right from the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a music piece must be played. it contains notes, the rhythm, speed, & etc; so the same MIDI file can lead to very different results as well as two different musicians can play the same notes on very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Good, I may not be able to force & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while a mp3-file takes you like a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can change the individual instruments, the speed & etc; they have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">That can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) of & kmid; this happens because & kmid; without AWE support was compiled. to eliminate the problem, you have to download and install a source distribution (e.g. from kmid; 's home)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I have no pleasure to add all files separately.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agree to support & kmid; drag & drop. simply open the folder you want to add in & Conqueror; choose all files, and drag them to the & kmid; -windows.</seg>
<seg id="1688">In advance, enable the setting of automatic adding to the collection. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can use the arrow key left from Tempo- LCD to slow down playback. in order to restore the default tempo, you can double click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have on a & kde; -Desktop a & Conqueror; -window with my MIDI file and & kmid; on this desktop (if I want to play a karaoke file) or act on this desktop (if I want to play a file), merely go into the & Conqueror; -windows and move the desired file into the window of & kmid; go.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you want to listen to a file quickly, without them to add to a collection, turn off the setting of automatic adding to the collection, and the new; file will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Let's suppose you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.C. Zuid you want to play only the first file. thus, set the setting of automatic adding to the collection and then open a temporary collection, then just this one MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then connect to the B.mid and C.mid player and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people have sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! if I see these songs or the postcard, animated me, continue on & kmid; to program.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; in the moment I am written for my hobbies, but I try to have a little time to take me. as Hobbies, I try to do MIDI files, music and phrases.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where they can download MIDI / karaoke files if you want a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or even if you simply want to make me happy, write to me an e-mail: larg @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrais.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">You really do it really a huge anticipation, if you send me a postcard from your home or a MIDI- / karaoke file from a local group. if you want to send a postcard from & kmid; if you want to contact a MIDI file, you should get in touch with me as I may have the file already.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I have & kmid; completely written in my free time and it's not chewing the money. I don't want it to thank you because when I get feedback from users (postcards or e-mails).</seg>

<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer because the sound quality is much depending on your soundcard. it's not the same whether you use a FM device or a AWE card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you have no sound card, you have to compile & kmid; with the parameter MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL. it works as if you had a soundcard unless you can't listen to music.</seg>

<seg id="1709">The application window is made from so-called andockable windows. there is always the window with the central view. there is an information window with the playlist. and finally there is a information window that will be displayed only if information is recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to check the preferred connections under the menu bookmarks, but these are individual entries. if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other, you should use the category Daughty playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups in order to get an additional hierarchy, copied out his group and all its sub-groups to the current category and playback begins with the attached entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current piece ', television and thumb playlist can also be modified by direct editing the XML configuration files. of course, the various files in the directory ~ / .kde / share / apps / kmplayer / can also be replaced by the application. simply click on a name of a category. simply click on a sub-group. it will only display the XML content of this part.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, the menu must be selected with playlist players and selected either the Edit Mode menu or selected any other category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost when processing mode or any other group is selected without paying the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Due to the ease of the author of & kmplayer, some functions can only be switched through changing the XML configuration files..</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation of starting and editing can be deactivated by the editing of ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and change of [General option] No intro = 0 above option on '1'. if the option is not available, it can be inserted easily.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate another animation. & kmplayer; will note the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / kmplayer / note .xml and ~ / .kde / share / apps / kmplayer / exit.xml. the format needs to be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation at starting doesn't need to be short, it will automatically terminate by opening another source. this would be disrupting the application, the user can terminate the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of an start-animation can be a favorite photos: & lt; molds; & lt; Approved; / / / home / Koos / mum.gif '/ / / home / Koos / mum.gif; / w; / smilgt; In the directory testing / some examples of SMIL that are supported by & kmplayer;</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a rider for configuring MPlayer in the configuration dialog of & kmPlayer;. here, the path of the player and the space-size of the data center will be set out of the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the Button 'console' in the tool bar of kmplayer. here is the output of mplayer.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no rider for this rendition in the configuration dialog of & kmplayer;. everything must be configured by manual editing the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc. here is an example like a 'flash' with the module swfdec movers.</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash' can be played within & kmplayer; it can even be inserted a special field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">With that the & kmplayer; 'flash' can play in HTML pages, must be the & kmplayer; module as a service provider for the Mime type application / x-Shockwave-flash in the setting of file orders of KDE.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Conqueror or & kmplayer; is in a console application to start and search the error messages concerning the loading of the browser library. if there is no error, the backend edition is within & kmplayer; (view, console or console from the context menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">This is always a prevalent backend for a specific Mime type (of course only if this has been determined), this should be done by manual changing of the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc. for example, phonon all ogg files are used:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& kmplayer; can play TV cards, either by using MPlayer or Xvideo (this needs kxvplayer). before TV can be configured to utility device and TV channels. this can be edited manually from the configuration dialog, or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">For configuring the VDR (video data Rekorder) settings in the kmplayer is the dialog to use in the settings below - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR- &gt; Xvideo port. there, you should have to be found out of which one is selected. the correct name has to be found (e.g. it is PAL for west Europe), the correct name has probably included a DVB in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support of kmplayer can only work XVideo (probably this kind of playoff of video equipment under Linux can also work out. this is also only available on the first screen (: 0.0). this is why the video is functioning properly for the X server (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config) this reason.</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally they are used by KMplayers for the sources different names. at the time of the origin of this documentation this is dvdnavsource, tvdsource, tvsource, tvsource, urlsource, vcdsource and vdrresource. if they are activated, they start playing the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1731">Are there any notices as I can make my CDROM drive when I play from it (not by vcd: / /)?</seg>
<seg id="1732">Yes, the command hdparm -e 8 / dev / cdrom is root as a user root after the inclusion of the device. it is absolutely secure to make that / dev / cdrom indicates the CDROM drive.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Xine starts slowly, why do I have to checked my CPU on your performance every time?</seg>

<seg id="1803">When creating your own template it is therefore necessary to know what character strings of which variables are replaced:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is replaced by the input in documentation class. typically, it will be following:\\ documentclass [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {article}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The easiest way to create a template is the use of the Assistant and the associated entry into the editor. once the document has been created, mÃ ¼ ssen has finished the following steps:</seg>

<seg id="1932">Here you can enter the search ad. using plug-ins without a storage location & quantitative aplus; this path for searching for the search of the plug-ins.</seg>
<seg id="1933">Often on a project several people work in a kind of hierarchical relationship. & quantitative aplus; supports the indication of team members and these can be configured with Shift; F7 project project characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="1934">The name and email entries are self-explanatory. Nickname is the top name of the user and serves to clear identification.</seg>
<seg id="1935">One member can have several roles in the project, such as both team leader and subproject leaders.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can choose from the list of teammates, who is it. this happens by taking the team member from the list and push the button Setze. the currently selected member (their identification) will be fett after you are: text.</seg>
<seg id="1937">Surname and attitude of own identity are important concerning messages and comments. see for further information about annotations.</seg>
<seg id="1938">Besides the overview of their team, there is another advantage through the acquisition of the teams: it may be created an event on the team leader if something is happening within. see for further information.</seg>
<seg id="1939">Event actions are actions which can be executed if something is happening within the project. an example would be how much someone is backed up, or the sending of a message if a file is secured, or a script that plays a file into CVS as soon as they will be added to the project & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1940">On the page event configuration of the Shift; F7 project project settings dialog boxes may be created, processed and deleted.</seg>
<seg id="1941">An email will be sent to the address data selected in the receiver list. address can be a team-or subproject leader. see, wei such ladder set up.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Notes are special comments in documents. they differ from normal comments by the following things:</seg>
<seg id="1943">Note: it can be simply inserted either a note from the editor-text menu or the @ annotation keyword in a comment area followed by antigen text.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Note that a particular member of the team will be sent. in this case, the syntax @ annotation (nickname) or @ annotation (role), the top name of the team leader, sub-project leader after enriching and subproject guides should be given as defined in the examples below.</seg>
<seg id="1945">Nicknames and castors names are independent of large or small cutouts, but spaces around the clamps and the: make the note invalid.</seg>
<seg id="1946">& Exaplus; is a development environment for scripts and formatting languages supported by DTD-agnostic and script languages.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The settings can be reached via the settings. here only via & quantitative aplus; -specific settings are treated, a short description for those can be found in.</seg>
<seg id="1948">The settings can be viewed by settings Quanta... may be called by a few pages that will be treated successively.</seg>
<seg id="1949">The behaviour of & quantitative details; regarding tags, including car completion, the entries can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1950">Large / small scrollment of tags: large / small scrollment of automatic tags: normal sized / small jections means, the tags will be inserted as they are described in the tagXML files.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Large / small scrollment of Attribucks: large / small cutouts from automatically introduced attribute. normal Groß / small jections means the attributes are added as described in the tagXML files.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Optional Tags automatically include: if necessary, it is optional for tags, for which the closing day is optional, this is immediately inserted after the & gt; inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1953">Not optional tags automatically: as above for all other tags with the exception of the simple tags.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Start and closing date automatically update: if enabled, the corresponding closing day will be changed and vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Automatic replacement of accent sign: controls the automatic transformation of acclaimed characters in the corresponding coding during intippies.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Mime types: mimetypes for detection of different types of files. using button standard, the standard pre-set files can be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Standard Dracoding: the encoding of newly created or in other way as with file opening open files (where the encoding of the file can be negotiated), but this setting is being displayed by the same in the project characteristics, if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD is not recognized. but this setting is being displayed by the same in the project characteristics, if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Create a backup copy: & quantitative aplus; created regularly backup copies so that when a current failure or crash can be recovered from this backup file, this is not the same as saving the file. this is not the same as saving the file. however, it is not used for backup regularly, according to the set time.</seg>
<seg id="1960">The preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editorial field or one own view (or the documentation in a carteireiter) which makes it possible to preview the documentation, preview and source code simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1961">Set the window settings on the standard back to the next start is useful if the user interface has come through changing the MDI modes and andocken / depend on views each other. it corresponds to the --resetlayout command line parameters.</seg>
<seg id="1962">The warning messages range is the tax of the possibility to disable the indication of warnings by Anhack of no more questions.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The place to change the behaviour of & VPL; can change the display of symbols instead of scripts, as well as the synchronisation of the VPL- and the source code in divided mode. regarding the different modes see.</seg>
<seg id="1964">Here is the parser and the structural tree that shows the picture of the parser-nodes into the document, in details.</seg>
<seg id="1965">In the area of mouse click on the structural tree, the following action is possible to change the structure of the structure with the mouse's mouse.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the field of structural change settings, the visibility of nodes in tree, can be set automatically as deep with a change of the structural tree. empty nodes are the empty areas in the text, whereas empty groups are that there are no element found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The area for stays of abbreviations (a type of templates) that can be unfolded when working on large text. abbreviations are divided into groups, each can enter a valid group of PHP, in which the ifclause abbreviation is slightly different than in a group valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">The plug-ins can be managed here. plug-ins are KPart-Applications from the third side, which can be re-used by any KPart-capable application, at the most famous & Conqueror;. with insertion of a plug-ins must be given the following:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to the plugin if it is not at a standard like $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Input: this information is handed over to the plugin to the start, so it can open the current file, the corresponding folders (path of current file) or the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="1971">Component in "Only-Lese" mode: check if the plugin does not accept the store. only-Lese-Kparts usually refuse to load when this option is not chosen.</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plugin: this is activated, then testis & quantitative aplus; if the selected information is correct. then, if the plugin is not available at the moment, if the plugin is not available at the moment, but it will be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantitative aplus; starting from version 3.3, the troubleshooting has been completely developed. dial support for the DBG Debugger. instead, the support for the DBG Debugger. instead of which a debugger plugin concept was implemented, which allows various implementations via plug-ins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently only a plugin is available, the support for the use of & gubed; inquantitative aplus; inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1975">Use of the debuggers for a project starts with the selection of a suitable Debugger plug-ins in the project settings. using the Options options, next to the debug plugin selection field, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If a debugger enabled a debugger, some additional elements appear at the & quantitative aplus; user interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view that is displayed in the contents of monitored variables. normally you will be in the left Dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view, where all hold points, with line numbers and conditions are listed below. usually in the bottom dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view in which the edition (as shown in HTML) of the debuggers will be displayed in the bottom dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported features of the monitor, everything is available or part of the following functionality.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Using this action, the connection to Debugger, if necessary, or they share the plugin to listen to debug. this promotion is opened by default if a project is opened, which must not be counted in normal case.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The equivalent session on the debugging session starts the session. closes the connection to Debugger or end the listen to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Transmits a HTTP requirement to the server using a debug request. this is equivalent to the use of a browser to view the current document. the issue of this requirement is displayed in the Debugger issue.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Indicates the debugger to start and send information about the supervised variables and the currently completed line. if this happens while the script is done, the execution is done before a debuganion started, the script will start with the requirement.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Indicates the debug to begin with the execution of the script, without information on supervised variables and the current line number. if this happens while a script has been given, the execution begins as soon as a request has been placed.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger performs the next statement in the script without entering into the functions or include.</seg>
<seg id="1987">Debugger performs the next statement in the script, whereby if possible in functions and include requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Shows the debugger to transfer the instruction and go to the next such as if there are not the current.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog where a variable or expression can be entered, which should be monitored. the supervised value appears in the variable view.</seg>
<seg id="1990">With this dialogue a variable is entered or a new value of a variable can be set.</seg>
<seg id="1991">& kxOpen; is a work by Keith Isdale like this part of the documentation. & kxOpen; is a & kde; front-end and a KPart of xsldbg which they can find at http: / / xsldbg.sf.net with many more works of Keith.</seg>
<seg id="1992">This chapter describes how to adjust & quantitative aplus; to adapt to your needs, and how to help and be able to become better.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Documentation of editing packages (DTEP; s) are used in & quantitative (DTEP;) to give support for markup- and script languages as well as CSS. your simplicity and flexibility are made from & quantitative aplus; a fast, user-friendly & IDE; for Web developers, easy to use and productive.</seg>
<seg id="1994">& DTEP; there are two types, family 1, the Markup languages and family 2, the script languages or & CSS; and day file contain two file types, the text file and toolptionrc; and day XML files are handy, symbolically-oriented suffering from image buttons (above the editing window), the text and instructions can add faster into a document as a user may ever.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be delivered correctly (see below), download or automatically created using an existing DTD. see for details about conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how to create TagXML files, then the & descriptionrc; and also toolbars. short, one & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and the contents of the uressources, the & quantitative pletrc; file contains the rules and information of & DTEP; tool bars allow a fast insert of tags in a document without risk of a writing.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag file are nothing as folder. you contain only the & descriptionrc; and the day XML files. day folder carry the name of the language and version, so there. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of TagXML, and declare if they are necessary, or not. although not all necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible, so many users have a better viewing and more information on the work with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail: everything about the possibilities and the limits are explained in simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of an TagXML document. it can only occur once in a document. it may contain the definition of many tags if there is only one element type over itself.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The tags is a script function. when used is & lt; attr &gt; an argument of the function. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Only valid for the conference room class. the name of the basic class for this class. (family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Only valid for the type Method. specifies the name of the class where this method is one. (family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, the day has an common Attributt group and the attributes within this tags can be added to any other day. (family 1)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Set a text in the dialog. this text is determined by the & lt; text &gt; -day. that's an only element type item.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Described a attribute of a tags. this element can only be found for each attribute. additionally, it sets the name and type of attribute. additionally, there is another tags that will describe how this attribute is to be displayed & etc; This is an only element type item.</seg>
<seg id="2008">To fill the source code for the attributes in day Editorial dialog and the Attributes tree</seg>
<seg id="2009">Requires source = dcop. the dcop interface within & quantitative aplus; is used to reach the source data.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and the name of an interface. the dcop method name within & quantitative aplus; is used to achieve the data source.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, an interface and a methodology name. the arguments that can be committed to the method. can be empty or averaged 29%, meaning the name of the current tags.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container day formed the elements of a list. it can only occur once a attribute description. it is an only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Put the position of attribute textured in a dialog box. this day can only occur for any attribute in a dialog (e.g. once for each & lt; attr &gt; -day). the element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Returns the position and size of a field in dialogue. this day should be present for every field in dialogue once (e.g. one for each & lt; attr &gt; and & lt; label &gt; Tag). this element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">There is a list of elements that may occur within the defined tags. this element is an only element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">There is a list of elements that have one day. this element is an only element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All TagXML files must begin with one & XML; Declaration begin: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be mocked and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces do not influence anything, but pay attention on & and & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; whothis &gt;, and & lt; text &gt; will be replaced, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the tagXML files the tools dialog box is in the & quantitative aplus; -Window to start and check out TagXMLA. another dialog will appear to follow its simple instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available yet. currently, the verification takes place only when charging the TagXML files in & quantitative aplus.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In the following example, for a family of 1 TagXML file. this file describes the & lt; schema &gt; -element from the & W3C; & XML; schema. the filename for this TagXML file should be schematic day.</seg>
<seg id="2022">In the following an example of a functional family 2 TagXML file. in this file a & PHP file is described. the filename of this tag file should be overload.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2023">& lt;? XML version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? &gt; & lt; day name = "overload type =" function "reload type =" function "&gt; & lt; attest name =" class _ name "type =" string "status =" optional "/ &gt; & lt; / day &gt; & tags &gt;</seg>
<seg id="2024">The & descriptionrc; file is also fairly simple, and there is an editor that can be processed via DTD edit via DTD; for a newly created & DTEP; should be created for a newly created & DTEP; should a simple & descriptionrc; with the following entries will be created:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[General] version = using 1 for & quantitative aplus; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for each higher version. name = DTD. (- / / W3C; / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name is used as a Nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">A action can be set up with settings... Click on New action to the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">This promotion is assigned to the scanning box. with clicking the user interface, a button bar can be assigned. with Kone is the current keyboar removal.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. the text can be entered in detail in detail and inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. using this promotion you can use external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) that use the document or used as input (or parts of the document), are the quick start -dialog or the different Lo in... actions for the (X) HTML-DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">The first must be the name of the script and interpreter. example: SH / home / myhome / myscript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% skriptest variable in command line: global script file: $KDEDIR / share / apps / quantity / quantity / quantity / quantity / quantity / quantity / quantity in their path: $PATH There are other special variable that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we will be replaced with the URL of the current document. in case of a local document file: / from the document name.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: is replaced with the PID of the current & quantitative aplus; process replacement. if by & quantitative aplus; only one instance is running, the text will be checked to the PID number. this is useful if DCOP is used on the control of & quantitative aplus; the external script will be used.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameter for this event, usually the filename of the current document or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the above included methods, a script can be selected by & quantitative aplus; in the input field input can be determined, which can be sent to default. possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected section of the document is sent to the script. the% input is usually only meaningful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output of the issued application can also be redirected. there are two types of output: normal edition, written on the standard error edition, which should be specified on the default output issue, by using the value the selection dialog box:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the Markup language, it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups. it is necessary to create a tool bar for each group. in the given case it is not too many, therefore one can create a tool bar with the name of the brand-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a tool bar is added, you need to add actions and configure your settings. choose the settings.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are pretty self-explanatory. press the new action buttonhole at the bottom end of the window starts to work-mode mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill out all the necessary fields and add them the day to the matching tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete all and if the day attributes and you plan to plan, activate the dialog "Tag," when available, therefore a input is possible when using the action.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is that a bad symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? if we replace it before we have trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that the action is better represented, we'll use & kiconedit; choose from the & menu;, graphics other programs (or where else it is located in its distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; used by default 32x32 pixels, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit size.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that this symbol does not only helps you to remember what the action does, but also to all other users of & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard that the day start, I decided to create a starting button as a symbol. by using green (green becomes usually interpreted, or should at least, a message to the user), or should click on this symbol no & lt; startup; -day in current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol no need to be connected with the action. this is done by the menu with settings... (in & quantitative aplus;) and selection of the required action. next to the text box is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder where the stored icon is, choose it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the user button and continue with other tags, so it still gives, or confirm to complete with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Assuming you want some usual & parallaplus; functions to the tool bar supplement, or it should be shared to a better overview by some Trento in several groups. open the tool bar settings dialog for Settings tool bars. make sure the toolbar will be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I would like to choose the tramp (on the left above) for my tool bar. after selecting the element to be added to the tool bar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the element to the tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I want to preview a quick way to access the Conqueror preview. I will select it and add the tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note as the separator does not support the grouping. someone who does not know my tool bar could believe that the & conqueror; -Button is the opposite of the Start Button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by test all symbols to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Secure in the right folder. after reeXML does not exist, but your tool bar (s) should be stored in the right folder. please adjust your & descriptionrc; so that your tool bar will be loaded (s) if a file is opened from the appropriate type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most important extension of & quantitative aplus; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the script language or shaping language that you like a & PHP; document tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentation, you could check the & quantitative repository, if anyone has already done for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you have to search for a existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; -language. then you need to create the docrc file. the first part we have to handle the second.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, e.g. php42 / # elements in the main index Top Element = your description for these documentaries e.g. & PHP, # Sec2.3 Sec1 = Sec1 html 1.02 = No 2.html tag1 = tag2html tag2 = tag2html 3 = tag3.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The section tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, see the & PHP documentation here:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE config File [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level Elements Top Element = PHP 4.2, Calculated = Table of Contents = index.html Getting Started = introduction,... introduction = Manufaction.html... Language Reference = Spage.basic-syntaxes .html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this shows that it is a sub-folder in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the chess corridors (except the Reason) mdash; but try it out.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents is referenced directly onto a file (and consistent at the upper end of the building view & mdash; folder will be displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces do not influence anything, but make sure to & & & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantitative aplus; Resourcendatts will be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The depth section is the range of docrc file which is to be displayed to the coating of a textured _ Fetch _ array function. by marking the function called and pressing Ctrl; H for context aid would be displayed directly. there are only two types of entries here: the Context List (ContextList) and the File Connections.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of different context elements that should be available (for & PHP, these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your file docrc / .kde / share / apps / quantity / quantity / quantity / quantity / quantity / quantity / quantity / quantity / quantity for local and global use. then create a folder (such as you specified this in your file docrc) in the same folder as docrc, and copy your HTML documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you're sure these good and it's worth, please send your docrc files with a description of important information, such as documentation is used to the & quantitative aplus; -community. you will not be rich, but we will be proud to have worked with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantitative aplus; you are not alone. it is possible to share the separator of resources (DTEP packets, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates), and there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by email to friends, partners or else to whom. at different places there is an Email menu entry, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP) with email, tool toolbar buttons with email, in the context menu of files and folders.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Resources can be uploaded into our main archive, from where all other & quantitative aplus; users can be reviewed and only available when our Team need it as a correct and useful to release the resources that it guarantees a GPG / PGP key. this means that the resources are guaranteed for our Team as well as for later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you will be asked for their private GPG key (the Passphrase is not stored), or in the case that you have several keys, you may have a look at. in the dialog New resource needs to remain unloaded (URL preview can remain empty) and with click OK to load the uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Upload the menus can be uploaded by the menus DTD DTD package (DTEP) menu toolbar, and in the context menu of files and folders in the template and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, even before the installation, examined & quantitative information; the integrity of the resource is warned and it may be canceled. please read the warning messages carefully. if the integrity and the resource is properly signed, a message appears with the indication of the resource of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML languages which is currently not supported by & quantitative aplus, but it can be time consuming, because hundreds of day files could be necessary in tagXML format. it gives the simpler way to allow an DTD automatically into a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be used from the menu DTD Loading and Convert DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD-description that should be used. afterwards, the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / quantity / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! DOCTYPE Definitions: the string, that in! DOCTYPE tag, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http / / / html4 / loose.dtd will appear</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of DTEP after conversion: when activated, bring & quantitative details; after conversion the & descriptionrc; -Editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantitative aplus, there are some key concepts. to understand these and full benefits from & quantitative aplus. this chapter should be addressed to them with these fundamental concepts, without their understanding & quantitative details.</seg>
<seg id="2082">This distinction is divided into three areas: global, locally and projection areas. this distinction concerns a number of components in & parallaplus;</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for each, the & quantitative aplus; it uses everything that is marked as globally, in common order structure of & quantitative aplus; this enables the group of administrators to secure various toolbars, actions and patterns in global tree that are available to each in a multiuser environment on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development for a single user. these are custom patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory, so that they can use only this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-based elements are available only within a specific project. this can be everything by & CSS; designs up to toolbars with special actions especially for the files of a particular project. simply said that this is most limited size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which means the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantitative information; MDI; consists of some main areas: the editorial window, the building views, the antitators with information and toolbars. please strike in, and for further information about these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the antitreiter to the right mouse button to obtain a context menu with the current document called entries, such as close to the current, other or all karteireites, new, delete or uploading of the document, jump to a bookmarks or execution of CVS command to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right click in the Editorial section regarding the revised document content, such as basic processing steps (cut / copy / paste), adaptation of the mouse under mouse pointer, or open the file, if the strings under the mouse pointer a file.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top end of the editors are the toolbars of the Editors. currently, & quantitative; 4.01 Transitional are shown as standard for which a set of toolbars will be shown. in the course of the further expansion of & quantitative, the tool bars will be adapted to the new features and thus connected user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of tool bars is really easy. if they want to add into their document, then click the icon that the day represents, then you can add the data for this just added day. you should add a day that has multiple attributes (like anchor), you can fill in a dialog of different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The building views (QIT;) enable it to navigate to the information & quantitative information; to navigate to open and cross-strips. in the diagram with antlers are available for files, project, pattern templates, documentations, attributes and documentation building views.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool which provides & quantitative information; this view shows all the files in the project and allows the management of the files in the project with right mouse click. actions like adding, removing, upload or deletion of files from storage medium can be carried out using the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another option of & quantitative aplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website & etc; It is available to you all possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories, depending on which connection they are used. the category depends on & quantitative information. global templates are always available, local templates only for the respective users and templates in projects are only available in the project. more to templates can be found in.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information about the available script languages. the concept of the integration in Global, Local and project also works here. by clicking with the left mouse button you can call the available information to a script. via the right mouse button, further functions are available, such as the script to start, edit or send an email.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With this view, one shows the internal structure of the active document. by left-click of an element, the cursor is placed on the position of the element. by the right click of an element, a list of commands will open in terms of navigation and the loading of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears under the other architectural views. with it, manfast attributes and namespaces can change. that's the contents of all available attributes with a few clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation for Web technology for your development. it can be downloaded documentation for & quantitative details; from the quantitative aplus; it can create their own documentation, and can be viewed and viewed by adding a folder doc to a project.</seg>
<seg id="2099">As standard, & quantitative aplus; two antlers at the bottom end of the window can be reached via the useful information window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This carteireiter shows information about each in Quanta running script. for example, the DTD uses the current document and all changes to the DTD.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This carteireiter shows all the errors in the markup of the current document. & quantitative pletus; scripts that are executed, give all error messages (as it gives) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantitative aplus; tool bars are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command. the chocolate set aside is the possibility to define your precepts as symbols in & quantitative aplus.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantitative aplus; is the ability to send a tool bar with an email. & quantitative aplus; sends the tool bar as a compressed Tar archive via & e-mail; if they get a tool bar in an email, they can secure this in & quantitative, like any other backup and load!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to adjust the place of & quantitative aplus; it has autoconf number of options to get to the configure script. to configure a complete list of all options, specify. / configure --help. the options are simple to understand and not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems with starting & quantitative aplus; you should check if your path contains & kde; 3 bin folders. also you should make sure that no older version of & kde; 3 in the PATH. same applies to & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantitative aplus; is a web development tool for KDE surface. & quantitative aplus; was optimized for a rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful features.</seg>
<seg id="2107">During labor, best & HTML; editor, the developers of & quantitative aplus, began to deal with an obvious idea: what would be, if & quantitative; an independent, extendable markup languages would be? well, this would make it the absolutely great web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer limited to clean & HTML; it is no longer limited to a general and comprehensive web development tool. it is now easy to define it in & XML; then it should be & posaplus; it should be the appropriate & IDE; for that.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Well, to the above claim must be fixed, making & quantitative information; as a product on the outstanding efforts of the whole & kde; development community is based on? thanks to & kde; -rumours is not only this possible, but it allows users and developers, & quantitative aplus; so you need to enlarge it for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& Exaplus; allows to enhance productivity with intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this may increase the productivity almost any task. by the program compilers, it can be able to see & quantitative information. (more about it can be found in.)</seg>
<seg id="2111">& Quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it has been designed for fast web development and has been developed quickly to a mature editor with many powerful features.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& Quanta; Plus is not associated with commercial versions of & Quanta; the original developer left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>

<seg id="2154">& quantitative aplus; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed, but as with each Open Source Projekt, developers can always use help. if they want to support & quantitative details; development in financial form, you will find the way here.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should be completed best from top to bottom, as for example, after filling the project called the whole directory structure for the rest of the project, all these paths and author information fields can be completed later with Shift; F7 project project characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project, for example foo. when entering the name, file will be automatically filled.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of & quantitative information; -Project File. by default, it has the name of the project in lowercase and without spaces with the extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>

<seg id="2165">With this option, all files and folders are displayed within the main folder and you can make a precise selection according to expertise.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the main folder. you can select the desired files by clicking hooks or, by removing the Häkah, out of the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The latest screen of the new project assistant contains three settings that can simplify your work. these settings can be uploading in the menu with project Properties in the menu window in the sub-window profiles or with the Shift Shift Shift; F7.</seg>

<seg id="2182">Allows removing of the current profile. if only one profile is present, the button is blown to prevent removing.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password will be kept in the core memory and is necessary for programming. this option is useful, if necessary uploading of files is necessary and the rather unsecure password on the plate does not come into question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or leave the dialog when you change your opinion before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantitative aplus; you can upload many high-speed profiles to different servers. when working or creating a profile, this dialogue will be displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">That is the server name to be copied to the files. either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed KIO slaves. at least, you should select from & FTP;, file (locally) and NFS.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for transfer. usually, it must not be changed, except the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your attackers, this is either a timesaving function or a danger. use it to your discretion. the password is stored on the plate, so it can't be easily read, but everyone with programming skills can be easily seen in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is just a set of files and toolbars. it may be able to use many views in a project, i.e. through simple exchange of view, various files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the currently open files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views may be stored in the menu Project or the Project toolbar, which can be stored or deleted via Settings tool toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantitative aplus; with which one has to do most. this helps not only increase productivity but also allows adaptation of & quantitative information; at its own work.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above are toolbars in & quantitative aplus; best about the menu toolbars can be made easy. use and add to the tool. adding toolbars will be treated down in the section adding toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The tool bars and symbols can be set to either by context menu (right click on the toolbar), in which you can remove any actions such as tool bar, toolbar buttons or toolbars, which can be set in the dialog where can be displayed on this or other toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to a action (icon) on a tool bar, the entries can be removed and action displayed that are self explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The tool bars and the actions on them can be set up in the menu with settings toolbars... and setting up actions..</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are essentially documentelette, code cutters and files for linking. & quantitative aplus; used Templates basically like a usual file system with extended organization and interfaces. we can copy, postpone or any of the system available in the pre-deposit box. templates have in & quantitative aplus; in about the restrictions you will present for the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantitative aplus; included templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions set before any template prior to use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary is all that is not purer. it can be inserted every file except text, images, & PDF; s, Flash files & etc. binary templates are usually inserted in documents using links (e.g. images with IMG src = / src / url). some examples see templates under global templates. further information on templates tree is available.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be created from any text document. based on this templates, new documents can be created. normally, a simple report for the purpose and organises the work in a corresponding way to be efficient. some examples may be found under global templates. see also for more information on templates tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This kind of templates is useful if not a new document is based on a template but the same text area always to be inserted into documents. you can find anything from a comment on a final note up to a complete menu of Javascript or Perl. see for more information on templates tree.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, this templates serve for all websites as templates. you are a collection of different documents organized in a file structure, summarized in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantitative information.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Create a document structure to exposing (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;) and choose File As template to save local template....</seg>
<seg id="2204">As soon as this is, note that (even if there is a project templates) the template is not visible in the project tree. look at the presentation of the project.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click File As template to store choice as local / project template. alternatively, the selection can be easily drawn with drag and shutdown to the building site templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: copy the file only into a preference folder. it can be used for all file management functions such as pulling and storing or add the file-tree of Conqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">One can click on a file tree or in the project files tree-view to a folder and secure site template to enter a name for the template and secure it. as standard, it can be saved in the project folder, but of course it can also be saved as local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates allow a very goal oriented forward way. you can attach headlines and footlines or dynamically with & PHP; create, add files or interlink with them. additionally, one can keep some things when using templates in projects very deep in the eye.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the subwindow template is based on the files stored in $KDEDIR / share / apps / quantity / templates and / quantity / templates / quantity / quantity / templates. each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers, as stated above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To define the behaviour of a folder is in the template overview with right mouse button click on the folder and select in the context menu tab. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection field with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection will be hidden as soon as the attribute attributes is checked.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is by default, it is activated for everything except for the stem end. if a trunk folder would be set in principle, it would be explicitly enabled. in case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text component. if nothing appears, it is likely to be found in a pediatfolder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows one added or presented text for templates in this file. this could be general headlines or footlines for all templates for a particular project and allows you to equip all templates with special headlines / footlines a whole presentation with the matching headlines / foot lines.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, using the context menu (indicate the right mouse button) on a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and add templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantitative aplus; provides two modes: VPL; & Editor and VPL; the first mode replaces the text editor by the VPL; editor and the Second splits for the editor window in two parts: the source editor and the VPL editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it invites you to edit a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; then you can edit and modify the source code editor in which the changes carried out in the VPL; editor in the source code is visible.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editor at a document that contains & PHP. it is not possible to edit this directly with the VPL editor. to edit this text, it is necessary to edit this text editor. to edit & PHP, there is no plans to change this behavioural code.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works exactly like the first, except that simultaneously, the changes in both source editor and the VPL editor will be activated and the cursor in the source editor and in the VPL editor will already be activated, the key pressure is activated by the active cursor of a window to the others, whereby the position is retained in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The sync distance between the VPL; -Editor and the source editor can be set via settings Quanta.... To option of VPL; - View may automatically choose between synchronization after one click or automatically. in the selection automatically the recommendation can be set too. in principle, the recommendation can be set for fast computer and a large span for slow motion.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of the website, it is possible to select the title of unvisible tags when working with the VPL; editor is also called, as soon as a new document with the VPL; editor is also called. this is used to change the suspension of the hanging factor. this enables you to change the following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow storage of information about the document, e.g. buzzwords for Internet search engines. meta-elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below. one click on the list makes the change of content, such as key words in the column name and keyword Keyword 2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way of designing pages in browser. you can add CSS rules with the buttons below the list or delete a change on the list is just like the meta-elements. the editing of CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to insert a external CSS style template by clicking on the file and select the corresponding file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The cursor is used as in a text processing, not possible by reason with arrows, possible. under rare circumstances, the cursor is used as usual. lyrics can be inserted by intipping and be extinguished by pressing or distance.</seg>
<seg id="2225">To add tags will be made in the same way about tool bars, as in the source editor. it is too notice that the insertion of tags will not be removed e.g. if a Anker day, encircled with text needs, each other ambient anchor is removed.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some tool bars like the tables assistant or the lists are disabled. they will later work in & VPL; will work later on & VPL; in this release, the tables or lists can be used.</seg>
<seg id="2227">& xsldbg; is a tool for examining styles. in contrast to other programs for styles, the search for specific elements are possible and the execution of styles can be tracked.</seg>
<seg id="2228">To compile & xsldbg; you need to compile, except & kde; yet the libraries were libxslt, libexslt and libxml, which are available in a typical installation of & kde; already available.</seg>

<seg id="2281">So there are many graphic tools for the same. why so & kdiff3;? let me explain short, why I have written.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merger was very complicated, because one of the contributions had made many changes, and at the same time a lot of jobs had changed. another programmers had changed much text in the same file. the result were numerous conflicts in the assembly.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program used by me showed me only the changed lines, but I could not see what exactly had changed in these lines. and there was no indications of the places where perhaps only the refresation had changed. the gathering of these changes was a small album.</seg>
<seg id="2284">That was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could be the difference within one line and changes to white characters. later there were added any amount of other useful features.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to compare quick text, copy it to the clipboard and add it in one of the comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function which made a lot of work was the same and interact of folders. this function was related and diff3; almost in a full file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way clutors are fully supported. this is useful if two persons can work and make changes in one piece of code. the original file (the base) helps to make detailed changes. in this editor, you can even edit the result. in this editor, you can even edit the result. the screenshot shows three Quell files at the merge:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; helps you also complete the same and merge complete folder. this screen photo shows & kdiff3; when I will perform:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; displays the exact differences between today's colour monitors. if you often have to check code, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white character and tabulators are displayed visible. if lines only differ in a certain number of white character, one can see it at a glance at the column on the left side. (no offense more, if no man changes the influence.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is equal, and the other one distinguishes itself in one line, then the color indicates that the file is different. red color means that both are different files.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name, but in different folders, you can use the Tipdesk work by using only the file names of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Diff3 folder, folder 1 folder 2 folder target folder kdiff3 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 3 -o target folders</seg>
<seg id="2294">The opening-dialog allows manual integration of file names, selection above the file browser (file...) or select a last open file from the list box. the opening dialog displays your selection and shows it to the next time. you don't need to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C, the analysis of the differences with two files will be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2295">About the button folder... you can also select a folder, if you select a folder, then select the same or merge of folders. if for A a file is selected, then used & diff3; the file names from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If Merging is crossed, the input field is active for the target and can process it. however, it is not necessarily necessary to define a output file. you can do this step later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The setup button opens a dialog with settings. here you can define options before starting with the same / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you do not want to compare all the file but only parts of a text box. & kdiff3; allows you to select text parts from the clipboard into the active window. the comparison begins immediately. in opening-dialog you need to select files, you can simply lock the dialog easily with the off button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also drag and use: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from a editor and let him fall on a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">What thought is behind it? sometimes, a file like several similar functions. if you would like to figure out what these functions would like to load them in & diff3; download and compare these relevant sections. now you can simply copy and compare these relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently you can extract nothing out & diff3; only let's turn out the text in a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the pulling and copy of text into another program as cut and insert (instead of copying and insert). in such cases, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">In the upper part of each text box is the info line. the info line of the spring window contains the characters A, B or C, the file names and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window will rest for a while on line. then a small relief window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three sources of sources are the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (this default settings can be changed over the settings.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">If a difference is recognized, one sees the colour that the file distinguishes itself. if both files differ, the default color is especially useful if you compare three files. this is very useful in the next section (merge).</seg>
<seg id="2306">Left in addition to the text is the collateral column. if differences were found, the column shows the corresponding color. with some programming languages where white sign is not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (at C / C + + e.g., white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, relevant for the price processing and in few, rare cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line, which separates the abstracts column from the text, is interrupted by the digits where the respective source file has no lines. if the line switch is activated, the line is indicated on broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (below the reference point) also has a info line with the inscription issue:, the filename and [Gechange] if you have handled the result. usually it contains text, but often also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are disbanded, the Save is deactivated!!! (use the buttons to the most dissolved / unrest conflict to find any remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparative numbers are used, any difference in the same time must be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in one of the window will be displayed in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed in the windows. this group will then be highlighted by the current group. this group will be highlighted by the color background and it will appear on the left a black beams.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes, through the automatic merge or through manual editing, no further line is left in the group; then it is displayed in these lines of text & lt; no line in the source code; this text is neither in the final stored file, still in a marking which might be able to copy and add what else.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; Collaboration with consignment; appears however in the clipboard when you copy such text from the result window. do not be careful with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: if when selecting the sources are ignored the options, ignore or Ignoriere C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments are treated as white character.</seg>
<seg id="2315">This will navigate mainly to the pictures and mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you are in one of the window, you can use the arrow buttons at the beginning, at the beginning, end-end, Strg-beginning and Strg-end, Siw can also be used by other programs. in addition to the vertical image line, you can also click navigating to Navigate.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the eye window, you can also use the other keys for editing. using the Insert button you can switch between single-feet or skipping mode. (default is the feeding mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the clustering columns synthesizes the view of all windows to the start of the respective group (as already in the Section merge and the editable expulsion windows).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The tool bar contains seven buttons to navigation with which you can jump to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-down / Ctrl-picture on downhill) or to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-down / Ctrl-picture downhill) or to the next / previous conflict. therefore, all conflicts must still be considered conflict. therefore, the conflict must be classified between dissolved and unaffected districts.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the selection into the clipboard, you need to copy the copying button (Ctrl-C or Strg-Insert). if it is enabled, you should automatically copy the clipboard automatically and copy the manual copying. be careful, because you might overwrite the content of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Zeilenends are stored according to the registered operating system\\ r\. Kdiff3 does not use the line-off range\\ r\. Kdiff3 reserves the line end of the source files, therefore you should use & kdiff3; also do not use binaries.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and list of the most recently used files will be stored automatically and reproduced at the next start. (pop-up menu &gt; Cat. 3...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Choose a lettering with fixed width. (on some systems the dialog displays scriptures with variable width, you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you disable this option, differences in short text will be displayed. if the chosen font is not supported, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be rounded. on these systems the button settings automatically introduces an unjust color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">When this option is enabled, the appropriate number of space is inserted when pressing the tabulator key. otherwise, a tabulator-character is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">When you press the input or return, the reiteration of the prior line will be automatically used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">When this option is activated, any selection will automatically be copied to the clipboard. manually copy the manual in the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can choose which type of line type you prefer to store. the default value is the generally usual selection of the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">At the same of files try & kdiff3; first, all complete identical lines will be ignored in the source files. only during this first step, white characters can be ignored. in this step, white sign will not be ignored. in this step, white sign will not be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) store a car backdrop '\' at the end of one line, but then they could only be ignored with different sizes on the side-side comparison, but then you might be changed using different sizes on the side-side comparison, however, when this option is treated differently, however, this option has to be deactivated. in default, this option is deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="2331">The default option is deactivated. in the first part of the analysis, numbers and associated characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored. the results are nevertheless displayed, but they are treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The default option is deactivated. changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intense after even smaller submissions. the option is activated in default. it is effective with complicated and large files, but slowly with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In the Automatically-skip mode, this setting is determined as long the result of the selection is displayed before going to the next uning conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Solves automatically all conflicts in white characters being used as a source. (default is manual selection.) This is useful if white character can be used in many files. note that the automatic selection will also refer to numbers or comments when the options are ignored or Igouting C / C + + -comments.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are treated in chapter for scanning of folders and copy of a merge. check for details below documentation for the folder comparison and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is stored and already a older version exists, then the original version is the suffix .original file. if already there is a backup file with the suffix .original there will be removed without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">It does not fit the language of user interface. changing this option does not affect the current program. you have to finish & finish. (this option is not available in KDE version of & diff3; not available because the language is discontinued globally.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following coefficient settings can be set separately for each entry. if you use this option to all entries the upper setting is used.</seg>
<seg id="2340">Over the selection fields for encoding is a short notice that the local coding is not changed. (this can not be changed here and has an informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Customize the file coding for source files. this is influenced how special characters are treated and interpreted. since the coding for each file can be adjusted individually, even files with different encoding can be compared and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have handled a file, you can specify what encoding should be used to store.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-processing error, they could not operate with your codec. (for example, your files can function 16-bit Unicode, but the pre-processing command can only handle with 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can define the coding of the output of pre-processing.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Switch off to suppress highlighted changes in white characters in text or reviews. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments when the options are ignored or Igouting C / C + + - comments.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode all differences in one colour coded overded column are displayed. after selection of A & B; B, A & B; -gt; C or B & B; C is displayed next to the normal nor one second supervised column with the necessary information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you would like to use the available space on the screen for long lines. aperture simply the less important window. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Include the comparison window next to each other or in each other. this can also be useful for advertisements of long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you consider the differences and decide to convert the files. a simple click will automatically compare the merge and uses the file names of the last source file as default file for output file. (if this function is used to run the merge, then the name of last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">For reading a file it will be delivered first to this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command is visible and not the file itself. you can write your own preprocessor, which may apply exactly your needs. you can remove this function e.g. for cutting interfering parts or to correct the pressing.</seg>
<seg id="2350">For reading a file it is given first to this external command. if also a normal pre-processing command was given (see above), then the output of this command is used only. you can write your own preprocessor, which meets exactly your needs. each input line must have an appropriate output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The thought behind is to enable the user more flexibility when setting the diff results. however, an external program is needed, and most users would like to program the self itself. however, the good news is that in most cases SED or perl completely sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this pre-processing command to convert the input in uppercase letters: SED's /\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ 'characters in the first clutch string.\\ 1 converts the found text in uppercase letters.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some key words to automatically add character strings (info: / cvs / keyword\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experiment with SED, you might be able to understand it and perhaps like you like this regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">The ignores of numbers is actually a built-in function in Kdiff3. but it is good as an example for a further advance processing command for line top.SED's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Every character between' ['and'] 'is a suitable matches, and each hits will be replaced by nothing, so virtually deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several items at one time. then you can use the Semikolon ';' to separate the requirements of each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of SED you can also use something different like e.g. perl -e's / REGEXP / replacement / switches'. however, if SED\\ (and\\) are needed for perl just yet (and) without the lead '\\'. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal preprocessor are set for display and interact. further operations change only the data that the line-down-down-algorythmus.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases if you use a normal price processing, the Zeilenabd preprocessor sees the output of the normal driver processor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful but as with any function, the text changed or differences, you can not notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often you have to edit programmer in a file many files. for this reason, you can compare and merge complete folders with & diff3; complete folders.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... for each object a proposal to merge; you can customize the proposal before the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... you can simulate and simulate the simulated changes, without which they really perform,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... causes selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with the selected objects (F6-key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to the same and merge of individual files. you just have to open files at the command line or in the dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three folders are run, folder 1 is used as basis. if no target folders was used, use & diff3; folder 3 as target folders.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders will not start automatically, do not start the assembly. to run the merge, you must select the appropriate menu entry or press the F7 key. (see further details)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folder informs you a small news window over the current progress. if you break the scanning of the folder, only the files are listed until then compared.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When the scanning of the folder is completed, displays & diff3; a list window with results on the left side...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Any file and folder where each folder was found during the scan, will be displayed here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The file structure is normally displayed together. you can use a folder by clicking on the + / - click on the object or simply using the arrow buttons for left / right. the directory menu contains two functions of all subdirectories, and all subdirectories can be folded up with which you can open or fold.</seg>
<seg id="2372">When you double click on a file, the file comparison is started and it appears a comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder (A) again. these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other file, this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details window to the selected object. if the merge is started automatically, you will be informed about problems of this type.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the above picture, in the columns A / B / C the colours red, green, yellow and black are used.</seg>
<seg id="2376">Identical entries, the colour is also identical, even if the age of the entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered to be identical when you're all of the same content. then also folder the same color. with folders, the age is unusual for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea of this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colours reflect the colors of a sheet, which is only green, then yellow and later, when it is old, is red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C identical, but not B: copy of B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical but not C: copy from C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C identical, but not A: copy of A (or if A does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C not have the same file type (e.g. if A A folder and B is one file): error: contradictory file types. as long as such flaccidental objects exist, the merge cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B didn't have the same type of file (e.g. if A is a folder and B one file): error: contradictory file types. as long as such inerous objects exist, the merge cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The mode for synchronizing is active if only two folders and no more explicit target folders were specified, and if the option is synchronize synchronize, then select & kdiff3; the necessary action is identical, so that both folders are identical. if for one entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist but not identical: bring together and save the result in both folders. (the user can only see as the visible filename for output file only B; copied directly after the merge. copied & kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">If two folders are run and select the option of new file instead of merging (uncertain), then select & diff3; the date of files and changes the newer file to copy. if the files are different, but the date is identical.. Solange such an error cannot be removed. such a mistake cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">While playing a file after the other hand, a status column shows a distance when the merge has been successful, and according to other messages when it is unexpected, you should make a last review and see if the status is everywhere in order.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If set in setup dialog the file comparative method is chosen, Kdiff3 will display further columns. these contain the number of unsasteries, dissolved, not white and white conflicts. (the column for dissolved conflicts will be displayed only if three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either run the just selected entry (file or odner), or all entries at one time. if you have selected all intermittent actions (even in all subfolders), you can start the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you have no target folder, then the three-file-merge mode C is used as target, in the two-file collision is chosen as target and used when synchronize A and / or B as target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have chosen a target folder, please check if all entries should be displayed in the target folders. there are some options to skip through certain entries due to certain entries. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries: select directory entry / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the key shortcut). in order to insert only the current entry, select action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If by contradictory file types there are still invalid merge actions, a message appears on incorrect elements. you can choose a valid promotion for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">If you merge all entries, the dialog window appears with the options to execute and break Simulate and break out.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simulate if you would like to see what would happen without the really changes. you will then get a detailed list of all the actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then causes specific actions with all entries through. if a manual load is necessary (run a single file) then a merge window will open (note the screen photo).</seg>
<seg id="2397">If you are finished using a file, select the directory entry / continue or press F7. if you are not saved, an appropriate dialog appears. then & kdiff3; his work will continue with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If & diff3; on an error, a message appears and detailed status information. at the conclusion of the list you should try to try out the cause of the problem. if you want to continue to select the problem of the problem, or do the problem to solve another action for the entry or proceed the problem to others before using the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been merged individually, see & diff3; these entries (in current session) and leads them not even again. even if the merge has been run or not stored, these entries will be considered to be done. only if you change the merge action, these entries will be merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu from & kdiff3; (menu Settings - &gt; Kdiff3 setup...) now has a section called directory collation with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files displayed on the stated pattern are displayed in the element tree. separate placings with a Semikolon;. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is *. file does not need to match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders are displayed in this pattern are not displayed in the element-tree. it may be more than one pattern, use the Semikolon; as a dividing sign. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .O.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders are displayed in this pattern are not displayed in the element-tree. it may be more than one pattern, use the Semikolon; as a dividing sign. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .O.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files that are also ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this folder is specific to a .cvsignore file. (see below: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems, files have a 4 -attribute. in other file systems, a leading point is marked as hidden. this option lets you decide whether these files are displayed in the element tree or not. this option is switched on by default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">For links to files: if the option is switched off, symbolic link will be compared. if the option is switched on, the files are compared to the links. this is deactivated in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">With links to files: if the option is switched on, the links are treated like normal folders and recursive. (note that & kdiff3; not on possible records, a link would result into a final loop and remove & kdiff3;) This option is shut down in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">A complete analysis of every file through and shows the statistics of statistics. (the number of dissolved, unforter, non-white and white conflicts.) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binding analysis, and much slower if they contain any text. (specify a corresponding anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare great folders through a slow network, this is possibly faster to compare the amendment to and the file size. however, this speed advantage will cost you a certain degree of safety. please do not use caution. this option is shut down in default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to the confidential date. there is no real comparison instead. the files are considered as identical when when copying the change date lost. please use caution. this option is deactivated in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activating the synchronizing mode if two folders are compared and no target folders. in this mode, the suggestions will be identical to the merge that both folders are identical. also the results of the merge files are stored in both folders. this option is shut down in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences in combination, the copying of the newer file is suggested as action. (this will be considered unsafe, because the other file is not changed too.) This option is shut down in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folders will be replaced or deleted, then the original version is renamed and will receive the extension .original when a old backup file with .original extension has already existed, so this will also be deleted without further backup. this option is also enabled. this option is switched on in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally the folders track currency would be able to pull single files; you can move the window divider with the mouse. if you don't want to switch the window divider in the window menu and switch to switch between directory and text boxes between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Probably you prefer to compare a file easily using double-click. however, there is also a corresponding menu entry. you can also run a single file directly, without the folder menu. as soon as you save the result, the status will be done, and the file will not run once again when you run the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2416">This status is however lost if you want to read the directory again: directory menu: new.</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparent with help of KIO slaves. Kdiff3 uses this to read files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders to open to local or remote computers.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with an FTP server. the second command line compares a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has another syntax as local files and folders. some things you should note:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relatively undouched or... that's not possible with URLs, these are always absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, idle &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named with the name / # foo # the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the file system on the server, sometimes by the protocol. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished whether a link is pointing to a file or folder. then it is always assumed to mark a file as link target. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no possibility to process permissions or change date. hence, the permissions or change of change from the original. (note that option is confidential in size.) (This is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose of use is currently as the differences viewer in KDevelop. KDevelop first launch the built-in differences viewer. to start Kdiff3, press the right mouse button on the differences viewer and then select In Kdiff3Part from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally you need & kdiff3; two complete input files. if it is used as KPart, it takes & kdiff3; the names of the original files from the patch file. at least one of the two files must exist. then starts & kdiff3; the patch program to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Conqueror, please click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview - Kdiff3Part. please note that this doesn't work if none of the original files does not work if the original files have changed since the generation of Patch-file.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & diff3; as part is implemented, it only supports the same of two files, a very small tool bar and menu. the merge or the same of folders is not supported in KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and Kdiff2 (now hew) are already. furthermore, the name Kdiff3 already indicates that it can lead to lead as the program diff3 from the sealing tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I use GPL programs already very long and have much learned about the sources of other programs. this is my thank you to all the programmers who have gone this way or go to it.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You have compiled the program from sources and configure the configure script, probably not the correct prefix to KDE. in the default setting, configure KDE the resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information about this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white character is different, these lines are treated as identical; if only one-white sign is different, the line will not be identical. if the Lines is next to Each Other, this folis coversely this line is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor is noted for any difference in the files where it starts and where he ends. this important information is simply lost when the result is simply saved as text file and it is too much effort to design extra a private file format that could store this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort was so far too large. you can always restore a certain version always through selecting a source A / B / C. to edit more large quantities of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing the text is suddenly; No src lins; published and the text cannot be extinguished. what does that mean and how can this be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; used already many colors for drawing subdivide. more highlighting would be confusing and missing the purpose. do not use another editor.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all functions of & diff3; use & kde; 3.1 or newer.</seg>
<seg id="2439">As you can use Kdiff3 on other platforms without KDE, you can find on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">A list of last changes can be found under http: / / kdiff3 sourceforge.net / Changelog or in the Changelog in the source package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile & diff3; compile and install on a system with & kde; use the following command in the basic folder of & diff3; -Distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir gives the folder in your system, installed in the KDE. if you are unsafe, you will find further details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Da & diff3; autoconf and automakers should not be used when compiling. should, however, do trouble appear, please report on the & kde; -mailing lists of it.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or Shift) copies into the clipboard and remove the selected text. add (Ctrl-V or Shift) add the text from the clipboard to the current cursor position and replaces the current mark.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only differences: files that are identical in all the folders are not appear in folder, and therefore not in the target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version you need to update the folder to update this file with the update.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">There are only entries displayed, the differences are displayed. if the target folders cannot be copied to the target folders. if the target file is not already modified, they are missing after the merge. (the behaviour is likely to be changed in a later program version.) This option is shut down in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to choose the source with the label A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the lines are attached to the end of the selected group (if they already exist already). if the lines are already present, they are removed in clicking the button accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="2449">The default option is deactivated. the differences in individual characters (such as' A 'and' a ') will be treated like differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & kpager; shows a minipreview of all virtual work areas. it is quite convenient to change their running programs on the working area to stop them or shift it. this works both within a desktop and with several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & kpager; can display all virtual work areas as well as those of running applications. applications can be selected and even be moved on the desktop and to others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, windows can be moved within & kpager; the movement is possible both within a desktop and other workareas.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu varies from where the right mouse button is clicked on the empty background of & kpager; however, the context menu will only be clicked on a application within & kpager; however, the symbol and the name of the application as well as the entries are minimize, maximize, on desktop and editing.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to the full size of the desktop. appears only when it was clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to the selected virtual desktop. only appears when it was clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is marked, windows can be moved within the & pager; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other workareas.</seg>
<seg id="2457">When this field is crossed, will appear in & kpager; the names of virtual work areas are indicated.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Enabling this field lets you cross the & kpager. show the numbers of virtual work areas. it has been intersected with the name, the names are to be ordained, & eg; 1. work.</seg>
<seg id="2459">If this field is crossed, the background of each desk is displayed as a background in the & kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2460">When this field is crossed, the running programs are displayed as small windows in the & kpager; otherwise, only the empty workareas are displayed to allow their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simply displays simple rectangle with the proportions of the program window. icon shows the window with its standard symbol and Pixmap shows a small view of the real program. remark: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & kpager can be determined: classic leaves & kpager; in a 2xn grid, as well known as Pager applications in some other windows. horizontally features all virtual work surfaces in a horizontal line and perpendicular to a vertical row, which is very good for the presentation at the side of the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & kpager; can be used as an alternative to the Pager Miniprogram in the Control bar. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size, which can display window as symbols or with their contents. furthermore, he runs out of the control strip.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Click the right mouse button within & kpager; and subsequent removal of switch-switches... lets the dialog box appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">Currently that cannot be changed in the dialog for Settings, but you can do it manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor such as & kedit; or vi. if you have no write permission for the file, you have to register as a user root or to your system administrator. in this file you need to enter the keys windowtransparent mode and refer to the value. possible values are:</seg>
<seg id="2467">Da & kpager; part of the package is debase, you need a functioning installation of KDE property packages.</seg>

<seg id="2481">& kmag; is a very powerful application that will constantly be expanded to develop new features. it is optimized for use on performance devices.</seg>
<seg id="2482">If you like & kmag, a window appears as pictured above. the main window of & kmag is displayed as a magnifying window. in the following window will be shown as a magnification window.. The picture that is displayed in the magnifying window is an enlarged area of the screen and is described in the following as a selection window.</seg>
<seg id="2483">In the default setting, setting up & kmag; the area around the mouse pointer like a mobile microscope. alternatively, you can add a selected screen range in the magnifying window (selection point mode) or the surroundings of the mouse pointer to the screen (eg; on the left).</seg>
<seg id="2484">If you want to avoid the mouse over the enlarged window, select the mouse pointer. please note that, & kmag is not able to recognize the form of the mouse pointer. this is always the default image; / Qt; -mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2485">In the selection panel mode, you can customize the selection window to your own needs. you can move it with the arrows and mouse buttons and change its size. this can be done in the following way:</seg>
<seg id="2486">Move the mouse over the magnifying window and hold down the left mouse button, so you can move the contents of the magnifying window and move. this also goes with the arrow buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If you need to press the & Shift, button or use the & MMB; you can move the selection window.</seg>
<seg id="2488">Using this combination you can change the size of the selection window. note that the upper left corner of the drop window will stand and only keep the lower right corner to move.</seg>
<seg id="2489">& likes; possesses a lot of functions. you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer, copy in a file to insert into the clipboard (to insert it later in other applications), turn the image and much more.</seg>
<seg id="2490">Starts or stops the update of the display. stopping the update make sure the required CPU time is 0.</seg>
<seg id="2491">Choose the refresh rate (Very low, straight, medium, high). the higher the update rate, the more CPU time is needed.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In this mode, a selection window will appear. the selected area will be displayed in a window.</seg>

<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulate a mouse click on the same spot as soon as the mouse avoids a while on the same place. it is intended to help people who emulate the pitives of the mouse. however, it can emulate the pulling with the mouse. however, this requires a little practice.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can handle the pain, which is created when clicking on the mouse and helps to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, you suffer from pain, who are using your computer to use a doctor if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To show it even more: even if & kmousetool is able to avoid disruptions when clicking with the mouse, it is against pain that is caused by the mouse because of the mouse, useless. and as with all ergonomic support, the result may expire each differently.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and performs a mouse click soon as soon as you break the motion short.</seg>
<seg id="2502">If the intelligent move is activated, makes & kmousetool; a break after it is pressing the mouse button. now move the mouse, wait until the lot of the mouse button. on this way, you can do the drag with pressed mouse button. the intelligent approaches requires a little exercise, but you can get it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">After the end of the mouse movement, this time has to be sufficient before & kmousetool; a mouse click is out.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If you are switched on, the torch-shift time (1 / 10 s) is active. here the time is set, the mouse button is waiting until the mouse button is waiting to get rid of the mouse, if there is no effect due to the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; now it is activated by clicking on the right and back, followed by a break, a click with the right mouse button. a slow Move to the left and back carries a double-click. these movements will be saved in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool; the first time has started, but they can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">If the sound is delayed, you can move your reaction time. open the & kcontrolcenter;, go to sound & multimedia, select there sound system and here the rider. there is a slider sound buffer you can adjust to a lower value to reduce the response time.</seg>

<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool; initially with the presets. in particular, the intelligent shifting should be turned off. if you are turned to the automatic mouse, you can then go on the intelligent move.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you are using the audible click, it is necessary to reduce the response times of & kde if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should make sure to make a mouse click without any effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or in order in the browser window which does not constitute a link. you can use the mouse to use such places where you want to use them again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">When your mouse is printed, you should clean your mouse. that's usually rather simple. the trick is that you can not only clean the mouths, but also the rolls that are in contact with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First of all, you have to take out the mouse ball. as this happens, mouse to mouse. however, it should be clear if you look at the underside of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the reels. these are attached to the sides of the hole in which the ball was used. the dirt and the pollution can be crammed with a flat blade or your fingernagel.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations, the operating system breaks off the operating system of & kmousetool; when you use the intelligent move, this means that & kmousetool does not mean that the operation can no longer be able to terminate the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; use in another window manager and move one window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem exists that you own a mouse click. this is the status of & kmousetool; reset and you can continue to work as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool; continue to execute mouse click and put the cursor to another place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor there. however, use the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop when you want to retrieve your mouse over a neutral area. secure zones for mouse pointer. secure zones for mouse pointer & eg; the grey areas around the toolbars and menus and the cover lines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I tried to work with the intelligent move, but I do not create it to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The intelligent move is a advanced feature of & kmousetool; and it needs its time before you can move it to copy and to insert it into the clipboard, where you want to move the mouse with a pressing mouse button. however, there will probably only be some problems. here are some advice:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Use the intelligent move not, if you just begin to start & kmousetool. instead, use the text instead of a mouse and hold down the Shift key, while you move the mouse button to the other end of the text and move there again the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Therefore, use the audible mouse click. this makes each time when & kmousetool; the mouse button pushes a sound like a mouse click. so you can use the intelligent move, even without the audible mouse click. however, you need for some exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2524">In order to use & kmousetool; you must be installed the Xtest extension for & X Window; that should be the case most of the system.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse is only available when the system has a sound card and speakers and this is correct.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; when the mouse is short, once the mouse pointer briefly, this program was developed for people who suffer the RSI syndrome and those working of the syroasts pain.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; can also be configured that a certain time is waiting to start a pulling-up before the mouse is left. in this way the drag and shooting with the mouse can be done.</seg>

<seg id="2621">In filters, text is processed until it is sent to program in-dispatcher. you are useful for improving the language to replace wrong spoken words or abbreviations, to select a matching language and speaker to avoid certain shortcomings of language synthesis and their voices.</seg>
<seg id="2622">To understand the work of filters, it is important to know how the program "-dispatcher "work with a text. & ktts: distinguishes four types of texts.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The edition of Screen editing has the highest priority. it will be presented to all other orders and will keep these orders. if the edition of the Screen Reader is read, the orders will be resumed again.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warning is the next priority. this level is important news such as & eg; processor is going to be hot. a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders will be resumed after the issuing of the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">News have the next big priority. a message subbreaks off normal text. & kmouth; is an example for an application that is news. while you can welcome you with & kmouth; someone welcome you to enter the room. & kde; messages are also news. read it.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text orders. each order to use the card orders is a text order. KSayit is an example of applications that uses the text orders. text orders are intended for the issue extended texts that have no particular attention.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four orders are processed in queue long, with the exception of the edition of Screen editing. if an application is sending a screen reader, while & ktts; just a such reading will keep this issue and finished.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First you need to know that filters will never be applied to the output of screen realising. they are used on normal warnings, messages and text orders as well as on & kde; -messages.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filter process the text and forward it to the next filter. at present there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filter is implemented as modules. in the future there is still further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Replacement parts replace parts of a text by other text. the parts can be delivered either as words or as regular expressions. & ktts; is provided with predefined character strings such as: -) by text or for the conversion of messages from & conversation; or & kmail; in a better understanding form.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; transducer use a XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert & XML; from a format into a different format. included in delivery of & XHTML; are some XSLT files to translation & XHTML; in SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2633">You can send orders depending on the text of the text or on the program, sent to a speaker. if you have sent a female voice, you can read the text by KDE News about it for example. Siehe can read about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these different filter has adjustable rules, according to which he is used for voice output. if the filter appears that its rules is not applicable, he gives the text unchanged at the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">When a text order, a message, warning or a & kde; notification shall be sent, it will be processed by all activated filters, which have been established on the side down below. the processing of filters are made in the order from top to bottom.</seg>

<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is a W3C-Standard to mark text for a language output. this standard includes brands for controlling the voice of voices, volume, volume, gender, and pitch. SSML is part of the VoiceXML specification, another W3C standard.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently supports & ktts; SSML are only partially available and only in the basic functions. the following restrictions are available:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You have to install the Rab _ diphone voice (British male) since it is the standard voice that uses the festival in the SSML edition.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and punclimiting filters (SDB filter). this allows you to start & skip faster with the presentation, as only the first set must be synthesised, not the whole text order. so you can also skip or skip forward and break even if the language synthesizer is not directly supported.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you can see the propositional detection filter. when the first start of & ktts, it is automatically set up as a set of propositional detection filter. you can change its settings or modify other Satisitinertia filters, but not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2729">In the easiest way to try out the device selection by selecting: switch on the card selection, which drives & ktts; switch on the card selection again, change some features and check how the selection of the microphone has changed. to, of course you have to have more than one speaker, otherwise the filter is invalid.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktts, then faster with the forehead can begin, as the first set must be processed, and not the whole text block, which can be very long.</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can then stop text orders on the map ticket orders, even if the language synthesizer does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal proposition characteristic filter is automatically set up when you run kttsmgr for the first time. it cannot be removed only. do not change anything at this filter, unless you know what you do.</seg>
<seg id="2733">To compare text with a regular expression for satzend and add a tabulators (Decimal code 8) to Sattensions (Tabulural code 8). note that the standard Satisitinerary filters will keep the character set.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD Filter can never be applied to & kde; -News (kisers), warnings, messages or output of screen reproduction.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you are removed from exploring the normal sateraser filters, you can reinsert this again by using the file standard _ sbdrc.</seg>
<seg id="2736">On the card interface selection, you can overwrite the speaker settings for the application. the card ticket is displayed if</seg>

<seg id="2740">Select here the features of the desired microphone station. if this property doesn't matter, don't give it any matter.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Check out this check box when the property should have priority before other features. you can also use multiple markings here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor when there is a critical factor. you will always use this feature. the only case you might want to specify the attribute language, if you may know that a specific application will be sent in another language than that in the working environment.</seg>

<seg id="2752">The settings for the talk speed will be ignored when & ktops; & HTML; (this is that the HTML in SSML will be controlled.) Deactivate either the filter for the transformation of & HTML; according to & XML; (see) or if you are quite brave, change the .xsl file of & HTML; -to-SSML-transferring filter, and set the talk speed up.</seg>
<seg id="2753">I do not create that websites can be read with a female voice. I created a female festival speaker, but & ensuts, reads the websites with a male voice.</seg>

<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information about basic network technologies are given, in the second all by & networkconf; changeable configuration files will be discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This area can't replace more information about IP networks. in this section, only basic information about the integration of the PC is conveyed into a small (home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">At present, IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv4 is expected that it is expected to continue in the near future. this description focuses on the widespread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is the knowledge to assign the IP address of a network interface, at the & eg; workplace is the network administrators, which can be used for a valid IP address, or if available, the IP address can't be chosen as desired.</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up a own small (home) network the IP address should be selected for this purpose reserved to avoid IP address contacting with the global (Internet) network. addresses from the table below are not forwarded in the Internet, therefore its arbitrary use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet can be used for such machines through setting up a gate.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks mostly addresses in the range from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set on 255.255.255.0 so that all computers are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second the loopback address (localhost = the own calculator). the standard route is required for the IP address.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for the IP traffic in the local machine. normally, the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to an own so-called loopback interface, which works like a closed circle.</seg>

<seg id="2895">& kdat; does the band returns and read the forging information of the tape. recognizes & kdat; the guing of the band does not know if the band is being formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Recognize & kdat; the proclaim, looking for the appropriate index on your record. can this not be found, you will be asked if the bandindex is to be created.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything goes smooth, the icon changes for the tape drive to indicate that the band has been mounted. in the status bar there is a good news. the volume of the tape can now be searched for the band.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Prior to throw the tape, first the integration must first be solved. there are three methods to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">And, in fact, there is a modification of the symbol for the band that the integration of the band has been solved and shows an appropriate message in the status bar. the band can now be discarded without risk.</seg>

<seg id="2902">After entering the bandname and the capacity goes & kdat; with the formating of the tape. all data on the tape go lost! after completion of the process, the band is automatically bound and is ready to use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you encounter the backup process, you must select the backup files, that can be done in three ways:</seg>

<seg id="2922">This creates a safe profile with just selected files and default settings. you can set the following settings for a security profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current folder, in which the backup is to be done. the list of converting files will be automatically updated according to the selected file folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all files that are listed under backup files, only the files are secured that are located on the same file system, like the folder. folder that can be on other file systems, can be viewed separately from the backup files. each entry is considered tar independent of the other file system.</seg>

<seg id="2926">The name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup is used.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file before the call of tar. this causes that all files will be secured and a new snapshot file for the next backup will be created.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of buttons files & gt; and; and lt; files were not completely implemented at the time of compilation of this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">The settings can be setup via the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. the following settings can be set:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to the device file for tape drives (normally / dev / tape). this path must refer to the non-recomic variant of the tape device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">This setting is active, sent & kdat; before the band is tied to the drive. with some drives it is necessary to run before read or write operations.</seg>
<seg id="2932">The option is switched on, tries & kdat; to lock the outlet with tape drive. perhaps this setting does not work on all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is switched on, the deletes of the integration of & kdat; automatically disclosure the band. do not use this option on Floppy Streamers.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is switched on, tries & kdat; not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter whether this setting is active or not, you must & kdat; in any case the block size for your tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & dat; a tape is formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the band. this file should display only one memory block on the tape. the contents of the file is composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n byte) The volume-ID. the format of this string is username: seconds, where hosts is the full name of the system, which has been formatted on the tape. seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the era has been formatted in which the band has been formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file named in the folder $HOME / .kdat file.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives that can be administer directly with & GNU; - tar. even other tar versions should work as long as it is not an incremental backups.</seg>

<seg id="2940">& ksandlog; is a & kde; viewer for system protocols. the program is suitable for inexperienced users, where you can obtain information on your system or where the system allows you to obtain information about your system or install system log; experienced users with fast access to the example of information about problems that occur on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksandlog; helps users to understand what your computer makes in the background. the task of & ksecoslog; is a simplified presentation of the protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users, which can't know where you can obtain information on your system or where the system is deposited to different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Furthermore, ksandlog; experienced users allow quick access to the example of information about problems which occur on their server. & ksandlog; attempts to provide some expanded functionality, using the protocol files to be filtered and evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1, & ksandlog, has a number of useful features. among others include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for format of the Syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other features are also included and will be explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you see in the following screenshot, select & ksusing log; functions available, with their help the individual protocol lines of a protocol file easily filters and sort them. the individual options for sorting and filters will be shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start try & ksusing log; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocol has started. it will not be displayed under Linux normally in the folder / var / log, for the normal user does not have any permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filters according to a limited range of criterion or according to the selected filters. in the default setting, the list box contains only displayed next to the filter. in the default setting, a protocol line is displayed only if in one of the columns the character string of the filter search term is included.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also choose one another record at this point. select the column process for example in the protocol file protocol, and then apply to the name of a process, so it shows you & ksusing log; all protocol lines, which have been sent or created from this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is activated in the default setting and helps you to recognise the important protocol lines. protocol lines of level error are displayed with a remarkable color as a protocol lines of level indication. the colored representation of protocol lines can be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to display only certain process (e.g. in the protocol protocol or at cron protocol), you can then be useful to examine the process identification (PID) in the column process. this may then be useful if you want to check the output of a particular command as for example, using the Samba server. in this case you will use filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can jump the option to new lines in the context menu of the main window to show all new lines of date.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksandlog; allows you to use multiple protocol files in separate sub-windows. in order to open this function, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage. as soon as you selected a subwindow, select a protocol to display.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksandlog; has a dedicated website to http: / / kssystem log.forum-software.org. Dort you will find more recent information about the source of & ksecoslog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksusing log; can also be found in the following folder des & kde; Subversion Archive: ksandlog; in & kde; -archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; System V Init editor, rather popular (and the following is named) as & ksysv; this section leads a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The system V Init is developed rapidly to control the program starts when running the system in the & Linux; world. therefore, because it is easier to use, more powerful and even more flexible than the traditional BSD-Init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go on historical aspects here (amongst others, because I even don't know about it: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because someone might try to do a machine on system V init without creating a new installation and reformatted. the & Linux; kernel first will need to make sure that the old init was removed from there, if there was an option there.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SYSV Init also differs from the BSD Init that there are configuration files in a sub-folder of / etc. this folder name is called rc.d. there is rc.sysinit and following further folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a lot of scripts. basically you need a script for any system service that would like to start at the High-level system or change to another runlevel;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things as setserial, which will only be launched at once. such calls belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should lie between / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if it's not much use for this. you can also use a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run something like when you want to do with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel is searching for various positions after the program init and starts the first to find it.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The standard runlevel is in / etc / inittab. you should see in the initial range as the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can take a look into the second column and probably notice the default level 3 is. if you want to change this, then you can upgrade / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. if you have something through it, then you will repair it by restoring the system and run the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how do you start it all the right scripts? if you enter in rc3.d, you probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that in this folder you will find no right files. instead, each entry here is a link to any scripts in the directory init.d.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How starts and stop init actually system services? very simple: each of scripts is so written that there is an argument as start and stop. you can actually start the scripts in the following ways:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would keep the httpd server. it reads the name, and if it contains a K, the script will be called upon the argument. if it contains a S, the script will be called to the argument.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people desire a simple way to create machines for many purposes. I might have & eg; a server running level, that can only run httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc; it also could have a user lap level, the & eg; & kdm;, network & etc; starts.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you can learn the use of & ksysv; you should not be very difficult because the program was such as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointer is easy to say trivial: simply drag one entry from the availability of availability to one of the six rounds to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also change scripts between Runleveling or change the position within a level by changing it. thereby, the entry of its original runlevel (or its position) is removed. this happens if they go out an entry out of the available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: you will be postponed if you prefer to copy it into a new range. in order to select only on a new runlevel, you need to insert copying from the menu menu or insert in the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the promotion.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of an entry is sometimes not calculated. in such case you need to edit the sorting numbers of surrounding entries, before you can try to insert system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: there is no possibility to recover entries in the paper basket. so be careful not.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tab button to activate the various working areas (available system services, runlevel 1 stop, runlevel 1 stop & etc;) and cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move one entry into another round level, move it into the clipboard (you can use Ctrl; X) and add it into the desired rounds level with insertion (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">In order to change the sorting number or the name of a single entry, press the tab button to change between different fields. do the tab button to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the menu file must be confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. presets are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc). otherwise it will be recovered from & ksysv; recovered changes to the default settings are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with the Standard Runes and now it starts to restart the machine. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO -Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in single-use mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the standard runoff level to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services with & ksysv; for execution filed under runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), then you need to edit additional files in / etc, which are available only in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The type of how system services are started in this distributions simplifies the configuration for proprietary integration programs in this distributions, but is unfortunately no standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using another distribution, please check if all configuration files are required (and whether they are in the right directory). some services (like & eg; Apache or httpd) is easy without message when your configuration files are not available or false.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The importance of & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you are using a different distribution, please send information about the runlevel so that this manual can be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the user and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & user; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of & user.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have made changes, you have to save this. either use the appropriate symbol of the tool bar or the entry Save in the menu file.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& user; is an easy application. the main window consists of two card cards, the user and the user guide. for editing, select the desired users or the desired group with a double click on the entry. it appears the user or group characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some cards are only displayed if you have extended system settings. only if you are using advanced system settings. only if you can print custom settings. other cards appear when shadow-passwords, or for example / etc / master.passwd like in BSD-Unixes are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The card password appears if shadow -passwords, or for example / etc / master.passwd installed like in BSD-Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card card only appears if needed for at least one integrated filesystem (quota) and initialized (recognizable at the quota.user / quota.group on the file system). here you can change parameters for each user parameters:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each file system. the current file system is selected using the field of file system with position limitation</seg>
<seg id="2997">The map groups informs about the group height of the chosen user. the default group, to which the user belongs, will find in the field of Primonal Group. furthermore, the user can highlight in other groups by changing these in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The dialog features of the group contains a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or a group, select adding the user or group or click the appropriate button of toolbar. editing or delete the selected user or the selected group works analog.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module you can install the LILO boot managers, remove the boot password, remove and change the time to boot from the standard operation system, remove the default system system, remove, modify, change and change more.</seg>
