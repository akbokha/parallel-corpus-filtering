although I had visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love to America is extraordinary .
as many of my generation I grew up with American films , I have read and operated with American music , American authors and his sport .
in fact , this country had a der@@ ar@@ able effect on me that I became mainly because of an American film journalist .
as 14 @-@ year @-@ old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , a fe@@ ar@@ ful repor@@ ter with the help of Julia Roberts as Jura student , the Supreme Court of Justice to judge his interest .
I was caught .
free to Method Man , &quot; I was it as if that is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that is what I want to do with my life . &quot;
and the year that I lived in Arizona , had only reinforced my ad@@ mir@@ ation for the USA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I always said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; America is the only country where I have ever lived , whose diversity is so welcoming , that you always have always who you are and it is easy Ac@@ cept@@ ance in a community of equality people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I even had a very anno@@ ying love letter beyond his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump arrived .
much has been written about the x@@ en@@ op@@ ho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most exceptional aspect of his asc@@ ension is to me as he is going to face with its commitment .
he never holds behind the mountain , as you says so nice .
he says exactly what he considers , like a former colleague , and explains publicly his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Latin@@ os , Af@@ ro@@ amer@@ ican and Women .
nevertheless , people responded to his statements and approved in dro@@ ves for him .
the 13 million votes , who won the Republi@@ can elections , was the highest number one of the candidate won by the party .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans that support these big@@ u@@ ots person , I asked me ?
I was able to bear Tr@@ ump and his voters not to learn with people who had learned during my time in Phoenix .
as for example , Professor Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , Director of the Journ@@ alism programme , people from all over the world , a deep breath @-@ man , with whom I could talk about Islam and his past .
the Tr@@ um@@ ps also backed by Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the present editor of the &quot; Cinc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er , &quot; agreed .
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to view the Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
Tr@@ um@@ ps Int@@ ol@@ er@@ anz is also in contrast to the gener@@ osity , which I experienced with Sandy B@@ ahr , who f@@ ights against the environment for life , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like their son .
she yet fits them to the dedication of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es , who always helped me with a lot of patience and wor@@ m@@ wood and my colleagues to acc@@ ust@@ omed us to the complexity of American life .
then Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors who helped me too much with my career .
these people and those caused by them deep@@ ens my love to America .
while Tr@@ ump ra@@ ged his way to the nominated Republi@@ can Presi@@ dential candidate , they gave me a halt and the equivalent of his limited vision of America .
however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
on 8 November 2016 over 50 million Americans , mostly white , the presi@@ dency of a man , despite - or maybe just due to its cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people .
the con@@ front@@ ation with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump , because they were either diso@@ bedient to their rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism , or because they were prepared to over@@ look these things , and broke me almost the heart .
perhaps it is un@@ fair the Tr@@ ump @-@ elec@@ tor as R@@ assi@@ sts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the people enter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of my friends , is exactly what has led us to this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is su@@ perf@@ ici@@ ally and resp@@ ect@@ fully and indicates an in@@ ability to understand those who do like a different way and do .
it shows the people that their wor@@ ries and fears about h@@ ec@@ tic changes in their congregations will not be taken into account .
could it be that these voters , of which most of them are , voted for Tr@@ ump , because they would like to reg@@ ain control of a country that they have disappointed ?
with other words , they may say that they are still important in this America ?
perhaps perhaps .
however , you cannot forget the words of David Rem@@ n@@ ick , who comments the cruel decision to raise a man who looks back down with cont@@ emp@@ t to those who look like it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( An@@ m . ) : as much as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ jection of white to all other eth@@ nic@@ ities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spe@@ aking of white in play on the White and whi@@ pl@@ ash , which means that the big Van Jones called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has exactly what happened to America so great . &quot; &quot; &quot;
millions people around the world estimate the American ideal - whether the myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which faith or background you can always have , America is worth each welcome .
for this land chose as his president , twice the son of a Ken@@ ian@@ ity , whose history , as he himself says that is no@@ where else in the world .
however , with the Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps election , however , there is a huge part of the white America &apos;s promise and says : to Hell with frequent , religious freedom and the whole term of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in the Americas after 9 / 11 , the white man again will say .
in all this I have to think about K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a rally for Hill@@ ary Clinton had a word change with human consumption .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would have been my son , Captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; he asked Mr. Khan .
the quantity responded with a loud voice &quot; No ! &quot;
&quot; do Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; ro@@ cking the quantity .
&quot; have Latin@@ os a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered them .
have A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they called them and their voices were pure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; don &apos;t someone who doesn &apos;t like you to make a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a refer@@ ential and loud &quot; NE@@ IN &quot; !
Mr. Khan ended with the words : &quot; God be than@@ ked to Mr. Tr@@ ump , is that not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was added .
the country , for which his son was fallen , sent him a message .
this is Tr@@ um@@ ps Country , saying the message .
and all the people , like Mr. Khan , could no longer be found in this new America .
and that break@@ eth me my heart .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero commune in the province of Oaxaca with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ean city of Cat@@ e@@ ura ?
the music that is played at both places does not only have changed the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large gar@@ bage dump , just 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists , but worlds removed from the nearby pre@@ col@@ oss@@ al ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
for some years now the La B@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( Musik@@ ban@@ de ) has been playing in the community : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , with their musical instruments one possibility to over@@ coming the surrounding poverty .
a musical school of 100 students has become a central interest for the church of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero in Oaxaca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the municipality , located in one of the p@@ oo@@ rest provinces of Mexico , is known for its Drugs abuse and the Ban@@ den Viol@@ ence .
however , this changed after an acci@@ dental meeting with a French pilots , who started a musical project and the youth offered a rare hopes .
the young band members take care of their obligations compared to the music group , the local press Not@@ ici@@ as Oaxaca N@@ VI writes :
as soon as they come from the school , they walk back home and immediately after lunch they run through du@@ sty roads to follow their great passion .
they come always laugh@@ ing and with shiny eyes and play in the bust@@ le you learn day for trumpet , tromb@@ one , Pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , forest horn , tim@@ bre@@ l , Bon@@ g@@ os and the Con@@ ga .
music from rub@@ b@@ ish
more than 7.000 kilometres south of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura - a village , which is practically at the largest gar@@ bage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paraguay , is based on instruments which are made from recovered waste material :
music with recovered instruments , made from local firm waste materials , made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ e@@ ura where the recycling of F@@ avi@@ o Chávez started to transform parts of the waste in instruments .
the instruments im@@ itate violin , viola , C@@ elli , double bass , gu@@ itars , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trumpets , trumpets , tromb@@ ones , tromb@@ ones , tromb@@ ones , tromb@@ ones , tromb@@ ones and percussion .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ an and Latin American music and music of the Beatles , from Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article in the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Chávez re@@ members a local econom@@ ist and music teacher of the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura to the initial time :
first it was very difficult because we had no space for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach at the same place where the parents knew no music and it was very difficult to contact parents , because many of them do not live with their children .
that changed when F@@ avi@@ o was shown something that he had never seen before : one made from waste produced violin .
today , there is a whole orchestra which plays on instruments of recovered material and is called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra .
a documentary names &quot; Land@@ ing Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( harmon@@ ic gar@@ bage dump ) shows the musical performance :
around one billion tonnes of rub@@ b@@ ish every year .
those who live with him and of him are the p@@ oo@@ rest - like people in Cat@@ e@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn it into something beautiful .

the orchestra even played his music before Pope Francis :
these Eastern African countries show how technology and team work can fight the illegal fishing industry
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that the wild illegal fishing is fought .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that targeted solutions for environmental problems .
the re @-@ publication happens in the context of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for joint use of content .
in West Africa , it was known that this ship had already been operated in li@@ mat@@ ory barrels of illegal fishing boats before reaching the other coast of Africa .
according to the Eastern African countries , the East African countries were correspon@@ d@@ ingly frozen and inclined to a sc@@ ary of the law of this kind to their coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the com@@ od@@ ors , Moz@@ ambi@@ que and Seych@@ elles mobil@@ ised rapidly against the ship . they refused to have one of their har@@ bors and ref@@ uses to share a fishing village .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Premier is surrounded by countries who simply refused everything to refuse , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reminds us of Ki@@ il@@ u , a executive employee of the Ken@@ yan F@@ isheries Authority . it is part of a team that discovered the ship and persecuted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 the ship was exp@@ elled from the waters of the region : it wasn &apos;t enough to catch the fish there .
finally , it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars on Liberia , due to pill@@ aging the country &apos;s fish stocks .
the core of this initiative to cross the criminal practices and resources , F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the N@@ RO stop illegal F@@ ishing ( Il@@ legal fisher@@ y ) .
the members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar for six countries that had exp@@ elled the Premier from their waters .
in this way , we have eight countries that are con@@ sp@@ inning and working together . they are talking about where to work illeg@@ ally f@@ isheries , &quot; says Tony Long , Head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts Project En@@ ding illeg@@ ally F@@ ishing . this project features F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support .
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated : what is being caught , is hidden , but because of it is extremely difficult to split up , the illegal fishing is a main cause of over@@ fishing regions .
because of the deliber@@ ate failure of existing laws , which should be protected by means of certain hab@@ itats and types , the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems will harm an equilibrium .
but while action against illegal fishing was once handic@@ apped by bureau@@ cr@@ atic hur@@ d@@ les and also through the sn@@ ail ent@@ ail , with the information between individual countries , so the actions nowadays occur in real time , with tra@@ ce@@ able on F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communications platform .
there can exchange the individual countries such as lists of existing licenses , news to susp@@ ect activities or details that could be noticed or experienced during an harbour inspection .
fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very atten@@ tively when they move on the open sea , via satellite data .
this allows to mark the authorities to mark ships that find in forbidden areas - about such a susp@@ ects think that a ship will load his caught fish on other ships .
ideally , such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fishing licence , where they were on the way and possibly even if they have a criminal off@@ ence .
countries that are against illegal fishing , can be refused on the basis of these information to accept such vessels in their har@@ bours . what means that the ships can &apos;t sell their charge , so that they could even be forced to pay for pen@@ alties , as in the case of Premier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it goes by significant financial losses for the owners , meaning that the illegal fishing catch is not fin@@ anci@@ ally worthwhile . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , executive director of NF@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consultant responsible for fighting illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i .
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created , at an estimated $ 20 million in lost turnover , which the eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i network lose every year due to illegal fishermen who penet@@ rate them in East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una @-@ fish bre@@ wer@@ ies that attrac@@ ts the commercial fishing industry from all over the world . under these also , illegal fishermen .
their practices include actions like the sailing under false flag , f@@ ake license papers , speci@@ als by phant@@ as@@ ien@@ amen , fish protected species and the fish in nature areas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take advantage of the missing international cooperation and make the weak@@ nesses of a non @-@ consistent control system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier , a ship was illegal and a country could say &apos; You could not run my port . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but another country could say &apos; Com@@ m to me &apos; . &quot; and just this leg@@ ale hat@@ ch tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i .
the closed front ends .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i was involved in more than 30 studies of susp@@ ects .
it has revealed criminal networks , who had f@@ ake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used multiple fr@@ au@@ dul@@ ent ident@@ ities and found it out of vol@@ at@@ ile ships and found it .
based on its collaboration with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority for com@@ b@@ ating crimes , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing over great distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us fairly wide in the networks of organizing crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it builds a system that should help F@@ ISH @-@ i , susp@@ ects ships more precise .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system that will always be further developed , also helps to hide illegal ships .
the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position . &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ g@@ g M@@ at Tra@@ cking , einer N@@ RO , which deals with f@@ isheries data and f@@ ISH @-@ i technical support .
some of the ships turn off , for example , the automatic identification systems due to which it cannot be created by satellite .
the Cop@@ eland is therefore helping to build a system that combines various information levels . it should help F@@ ISH @-@ i help to find criminal ships with greater precision .
a model program
but F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African Nations can actually take effect on the und@@ ou@@ bt@@ edly global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , president of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently the Sky@@ Truth has opened its platform Global F@@ ishing Watch with Google and the Oc@@ ean@@ ic organization Oc@@ e@@ ana : a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed worldwide by means of each individual tra@@ ce@@ able ship worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to gather together with the neighbours to get a better picture of it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says he . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to un@@ ite and bring their resources to study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this on global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project to run on which a global system started persecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only feel crimin@@ als but they are also scre@@ ams .
ships that had previously explo@@ ited the earlier without license and can hardly be reck@@ oned with consequences , knowing that they are observed .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ ISH @-@ i countries have meanwhile increased a 33 % increase in f@@ isheries , since then fishing boats buy more licenses .
after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had helped Gre@@ ko 1 doors found the insp@@ ectors there on board towing nets , whose use is prohibited .
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
other countries also notice these successes . &quot; the effect is so powerful that us now also copy other countries , &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; we have become a study project . &quot; in West Africa , several hundred million dollars disappear by illegal fishing .
in 2015 , six countries joined the West Africa Task Force to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . furthermore , it is the goal of leaving more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland .
recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s latest member of Somalia was able to report his first big triumph : in October , there was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that went on a false flag . and not only the ship was used , towing nets were used , which are now forbidden .
the ship was still booked in forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take a strong sign for fishermen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Gre@@ ko 1 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time the evidence that such a special , collab@@ orative work to protect the oceans actually works in the entire world . Emma Br@@ yce is freelance journalist and lives in London . she writes about the subject environment , technology and nutrition .
their articles appear in Wi@@ red magazines , T@@ ED Education , the New York Times , and the Guardian . situation in Venezuela will continue to continue : demonstrations in several cities with the aim to re@@ conquer the country . &quot;
the road movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are considered to be a protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum of the President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

after the government had rejected the application of the opposition to a referendum on a referendum , Ven@@ z@@ ol@@ aner , in whose eyes had the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country , in which they were assembled in the streets .
among the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the Re@@ order of Venezuela ) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them .
the debate will also be led in other parts of the country - amongst others in the low@@ lands of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ den@@ regions Mé@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , in the central north of the federal state Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and at Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ part@@ a .
the political and economic situation of the country deterior@@ ates continuously , which is noticeable in everyday life in the life of Venice by an acute short@@ age of food and medicines .
many representatives of the opposition saw the chance of a fundamental change in the official President of Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , but ultimately the post@@ ure of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , co @-@ acting during the Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ izes the context of the Government statement as follows :
as part of the social , political and economic crisis , in which the inflation rate of inflation was estimated at 500 % ( the inflation rate is estimated to be for many as the only way to return to the country to withdraw his institutional structures and to conclu@@ de a new government alliance .
the campaign of Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad , r@@ á@@ tica or shortly Mu@@ d ( about : round @-@ Table of the Democratic unity ) , called demonstr@@ ators to join the opposition to the president of Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro . here , the trial against the president Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro was scheduled to continue on November 3 , should continue to continue the agreement of the referendum to be held on November 3 .
the call was commented on Twitter as follows :

on Twitter are pictures taken from disp@@ utes , as well as reports of op@@ pression and mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment .
particularly large waves beat the message via police repression in the centrally located town of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there , demonstr@@ ators moved back to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves according to their own testimony before the police and armed advoc@@ acy of the government .
hours later they could leave the cathedral again , but the protests went on .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the An@@ den@@ state T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira :
the women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira do not wear black because you don &apos;t see what many national@@ ities have not have !
meanwhile , an inf@@ ographic survey already accounts for the round , which forms the magnitude of op@@ pression per day :
so the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government had asked the validity of the claim in question - this was now demonstrated in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the road .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Labs added to this :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ d@@ ado claim that 1 % of the signatures are counter@@ f@@ eit .
here is your counter@@ act !
on the road !
others , this prot@@ ested as a further step in the fight against a government , who made a little about the devastating economic crisis , thus prefer@@ able to leave critical votes against the devastating economic crisis :
they have taken us so much - but also the fear !
the mar@@ ches always take more on frequency and intensity .
some vene@@ ers reported the media to be hungry and to participate in a strike , instead of working or shopping .

the interview was translated into English and will be published here with friendly permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to view the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argentine town of Córdoba .
as an adult man , Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano said now in the context of the large La Per@@ la @-@ Ribera process in the province of Córdoba against his father .
in the trial which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes committed during the Argentin@@ ean military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano did not find his life .
it all began to bear the same name as his father , up to the most brutal Mil@@ et@@ ro@@ per@@ ations in the prison La Per@@ la , who died at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
for 34 years he held the family of family .
in the situation I believed that it was fine .
I felt like a secret mag@@ ent .
as a child with 15 years , you do not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
I could not know that my father was a thief , Fol@@ ine@@ ers and the mur@@ derer .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano was G@@ end@@ ar@@ eri@@ e@@ beam@@ ter . during the Argentin@@ ean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of State terrorism , his father was Deputy Commander of the Secret Services Division 141 in prison La Per@@ la .

this is not the story of Luis Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano , the op@@ pressed due to ab@@ duction in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and kidn@@ apping of a 10 year old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qu@@ i@@ j@@ anos son , a man who had experienced the extent of the atro@@ cities which he had experienced as a boy in the course of the years , and he had said before a Bundes@@ court against his own father .
his story shows what great power has a parent over his child and chose to chose a way for salvation .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father began to take me to the military base , I often walked with us in the sports hall . there I got married with a boy , who made mar@@ tial sport .
all called it &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and several days later he showed me a black @-@ white photo and called me to identify my boy@@ friend .
he said :
you are a dick@@ head , you &apos;ve joined you with one from the ERP .
pass only that they will not lead you a day and I must save you .
the ab@@ brevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Rev@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pueb@@ lo , - the Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the Military arm of the Revolutionary Workers Party of Argentina .
that is why he for@@ b@@ ade me to go back to the Sports Hall . some days later he took me with the military base .
he said to me , I would be secret .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be in order : for so my father had taken me .
on the military base I had to destroy papers that had list@@ ened to the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : University Stat@@ ements , handwritten notes , literature , certificates , prop@@ aganda staff , books , just everything .

my father took me four times after La Per@@ la with everything in 1976 .
during the first time and during the last time he left me at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he ordered me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ rack , in the cars , furniture , television , refriger@@ ators - just everything possible .
all of it was stolen .
he gave me a little into a blan@@ ket , and ordered me to wear it . when I opened it , I saw that a large cl@@ ump of silver was located .
on that day I went to the other end of the Bar@@ racks where the stolen objects were completed and under@@ took me with a guard .
suddenly he interpreted to an open space and said :
the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
I saw in and saw a song , tor@@ tured on humans .
it looked like a field bed and metal springs .
later I found out that it fortified the end of an cable . the other end was fixed by the body of the person who was right there .
they took a man with hands on the bed , poured him with water and pursued a load of 220 volts to the gen@@ it@@ alia .

the st@@ ank there was de@@ struc@@ tur@@ ally ... like a dirty wind .
years later , when my father stood under house arrest , the same od@@ our came out of his room .
I knew the smell immediately and I became clear that the smell of a body is in need .
I never was able to forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible to make a man so much harm ?
&apos;@@ i knew that these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the det@@ ain@@ ees were fast@@ ed with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and contributed to sight .
he spoke to &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; L@@ op@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pe@@ z , a civilians who was also in trial ) and I took the opportunity to throw a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses , on which naked people were filled with the face down - all were fast@@ ened at hands and feet .
in the vicinity of the entrance , people still felt on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father noted that I saw at the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why do you have said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why do you mean ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why did you meet me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and was buried .
I know this because my father told me home .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices .
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero stroke there a man and killed .
( according to the survi@@ vor@@ s of the survi@@ vor@@ s of Civil Code Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also indicted in La Per@@ la @-@ Ribera , students of Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Molina ) .
in the following video , Emilio F@@ essi@@ a , the director of the La Per@@ la Memorial , through the former fol@@ ds .
the road to which you came in here is also the way to which they came here .
when you see on the map , you see that they were about this path and tor@@ tured for the first time .
here their names were changed , and they were assigned a number in the process of de@@ activ@@ ating one number .
when torture survived torture , the det@@ ain@@ ees were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the arrangement of above came that they should be re@@ located .
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of people and the dis@@ appearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; war@@ fare &apos;
my father brought all the possible things to go home .
at that time , I had no idea what the &quot; war@@ fare &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was even when I was the military , I was in the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie - I became clear that war@@ fare is a bay@@ on@@ et or possibly military police , which one has fought against an enemy .

but if you enter into a house and the refrigerator , the record players , clothes , paintings , money ... sti@@ ve , then does not have any degree of war but v@@ and@@ alism .
that is theft .
I always asked me how my father , the head of security forces , could bring with this v@@ and@@ alism .
I don &apos;t understand it .
I was also an officer in the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter into an house and steal all in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do this .
once he called me a crime and I answered : and you , who rode cars on the road ?
you are no crime ?
he explo@@ ded before rage , struck me and cried :
if you go so far , I will find you and ref@@ res@@ h you .
to do this we need no other !
so my father was .
I have no only good memory of him .
when I said in the trial , I showed a photo of that , on whom I bore a jacket and a wheelchair of wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought clothes with home .
at that time , the defence accused me to have been a fellow soldier in this crime . I answered , no problem , they can set me to load what they wanted .
I was so there to speak .
&apos; the dis@@ appearance of the dead is the last ab@@ brevi@@ ated act &apos;
now , where I am older I Reu@@ de I Reu@@ e .
I have children . if you only have children , you recognize the value of a life .
it develops and recognize that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
good , you have ex@@ ek@@ elled so during the dictatorship of mankind . but why the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
why can children escape ?
one day my father brought a girl with her home , whose mother was killed .
it was like our pet , almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl .
I always turned the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
you could simply have to put it into prison .
I guess , it was simply decided to kill these people . but why does their bodies disappear ?
had these people not even families to whom you could commit their mort@@ al remains ?
the dis@@ appearance of the dead is the last ab@@ brevi@@ ated act , which man can do a man .
my father told me when the democracy was re@@ introduced , they brought machines to eliminate the remains of the prisoners .
they were shred@@ ded and no@@ ises - no idea , where . &quot; one will never find something , &quot; said my father .
but anything remains of course always .
&apos;@@ i have seen how you have killed people ! &apos;
just to show it , I have nothing against the military .
I even was even at the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said just the truth about 20 crimin@@ als - among them my father .
the thought to display my father was taken during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I made him a letter of all the atro@@ cities which I had to talk about him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I have not killed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt compassion , and asked me why the whole new patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings , &quot; which they were supp@@ os@@ edly def@@ ended , actually good .
then I cried :
how can you tell what to tell me ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have sinned yet , and you have comp@@ elled me as a child to participate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;ll show me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did exactly what I did .
in 2010 , I paid the first display .
I finally knew that he was a bur@@ gl@@ ar .
nobody can imagine that I was vo@@ re@@ engineering . I finally said to my own father .
Luis Alberto Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest standing before the end of the trial .

the sentences in the &quot; meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
the term &quot; meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the Spanish order of the judgment .
after four years , in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historical La Per@@ la @-@ Ribera proceedings were in charge of crimes against 7@@ 16 victims in August , 1975 and December 1978 .
he was found guilty of crimes against humanity for crimes against humanity . the Tribunal sentenced in 28 cases li@@ fel@@ ong pen@@ alties and nine cases of adh@@ esion between 2 and 14 years . in six cases there were acqu@@ itt@@ als .
eleven of originally 54 def@@ endants died during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ la@@ judgment : murder , torture and rape by officers . # Es@@ War@@ State terrorism
all the def@@ endants were members of the military , including former military police , former police groups and civil staff .
Pier@@ o De Mont@@ i was kidn@@ apped along with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he taught the following words to the speaking chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human heads .
the court part is a historical landmark for all human rights organisations who have been working for years in justice for victims .
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argentine organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , founded in 1995 , was murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said :
the trial lasted more than three years , but the research lasted 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argentin@@ ian government passed the country on La Per@@ la , so there was a memorial to be managed by human rights organisations .

an translation error makes older people in K@@ YO@@ TO to &quot; fe@@ ar@@ ful drivers &quot;
a sign with the translation error at a center in K@@ YO@@ TO , in which one can extend his driving licence .
the photo was used in the social media .
adaptation of the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese town of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can extend his Dri@@ ver@@ licence , in the last month witnesses of a very special translation .
in a sign the Japanese word ( codi@@ le from sh@@ a ) , which means &quot; older drivers &quot; means , perhaps - but perhaps also with evil back@@ grounds , # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; terrible drivers &quot; was translated .
the wrong translation took place from 1st to 20th September on electronic advertis@@ ements in the entrance and the building itself .
adaptation of the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was dealt multiple in the social media .
the error was charged with the translator Julian Holmes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers .
the daily Kyoto Shim@@ bu@@ n published in Kyoto .
&quot; how could it come to an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation .
this is an acc@@ us@@ ation for older people and in an international city such as Kyoto simply un@@ acceptable , &quot; said Holmes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the def@@ ective English translation was first removed . the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropriate title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ der drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police pre@@ fecture for the Kyoto pre@@ fecture . however , she explained that the error was already in the text which they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for their correc@@ t@@ ness before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported like this :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are sorry that older people are insul@@ ted by the in@@ adequate correction ( the translation ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News sat with the phenomenon of the &quot; fe@@ ar@@ able &quot; older motor@@ ists in Japan apart and wrote :
the word &quot; terrible &quot; was denied as an un@@ reasonable description of older motor@@ ists . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers who are involved in accidents are involved , but quite a reason to worry .
in the Kyoto Pre@@ fecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19,@@ 460 accidents were caused by senior citizens in 2005 . this corresponds to a share of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , Sen@@ iors donated 1,@@ 8@@ 03 from a total of 11.@@ 850 accidents .
thus , their share increased to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has fallen in total , the proportion of seniors caused by senior citizens in the same period increased .
the name not mentioned repor@@ ter in the published version of the article comments on the light that show the advantages of some Japanese apparent against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo on translation defects received the following comments :
- &quot; Is it not the reality ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so the translation is not at all , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
- &quot; I don &apos;t think that a real translation error is . &quot;
there are no few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a true mine of this bizar@@ re error in English .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ users Andrew .
the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are mani@@ fold .
you need two important skills : passive voice knowledge to understand the output text and active language skills to transfer it into the target language .
the latter requires the active master of the target language - something that is in native speakers in case . in general , the convic@@ tion applies that trans@@ lat@@ ors in the target language - not in the output language - speakers should be .
so , a French native language should translate from English to French - not from French to English .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ User Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ workers with English as the mother tongue that might have translations into English . this may be missing to lack of terms , cost reasons , or the relatively small number of English speakers that may learn Japanese .
some companies that have self @-@ employed translation have no foreign staff . then the Japanese company , whose English knowledge is considered to be the best one , for trans@@ lat@@ ors - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ User Karl Baron .
machine translation are also widespread - often with funny results .
the wor@@ r@@ ens and en@@ cap@@ tive propositions which are made by mechanical translations , show that this technique is still unable to replace human trans@@ lat@@ ors . this applies to some languages for a few languages .
some of the stran@@ gest English formulation in Japan , including those that are often used T @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for sty@@ li@@ stic reasons - not to be read or understood even though .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ users Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors like jewelry still acceptable or at least harm@@ less . but by major companies or from the government that have funds to ensure greater standards can be expected to expect more carefully .
the city of Kyoto uses a serious source of their translations in the future .
Venezuela : protests and media measures on the Internet and Television
the main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( free surfing ) of IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to PRE@@ N@@ SA y Soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institute of Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , 7 April , ven@@ ez@@ oli@@ an Internet users , that they had no access to the online transmitter Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay .
later other users wrote that the Internet recording of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV did not be accessible anymore .
other online transmitters also contributed to the recordings of the protests in Caracas , which were organized by op@@ positi@@ onal groups , who resi@@ sted the Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros by the government .
the protests began in early April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the parliament and transferred the duties of the Parliament to the executive and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection is glu@@ ed and receiving the us@@ ern , VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# C@@ ens@@ or@@ ship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages of ven@@ ez@@ ol@@ ish provider are again closed .
that is from the site of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular in vene@@ ers with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media have been on the reporting period since 2014 . at that time , the Commission threatened to report on t@@ elecommun@@ ication with fin@@ es and closure , if they continue to report about demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as a &quot; Declaration on violence . &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels , I signed again at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
aston@@ ishing that it is cheaper than to buy two litres of lim@@ on@@ ade .
the local NGO Co @-@ fil@@ tro confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay is un@@ accessible through a blocking of the domain name system ( DNS ) but also two further online transmitter . this also applies to the website where the National Assembly transfers its sessions .
earlier follow @-@ up of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , showing that the local Internet providers are able to use DNS . this is a technology that answer the DNS server requests concerning certain domains .
if a website has been blocked by DNS , the server answers incorrect or denied the inquiry to call such a website .
we confirm a DNS @-@ lock : @ el@@ o@@ lic@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
on V@@ PI@@ TV , a third per@@ si@@ bly channel , the transfer was set on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ PI@@ TV @-@ Camer@@ am@@ ann El@@ vis Flo@@ res , who was transferred live in Caracas , was put into custody .
Flo@@ res was defeated , whilst he was in police custody .
he was released eight hours later , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on show again .
even though some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it has also been reported that the government is regulated by the government : thus the Ven@@ z@@ ol@@ an@@ ians will always be worth the access to multi media coverage over the current events in the country .
many girls to act as a slave in Paraguay
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a cri@@ m@@ ita . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today , Tina is fought for the rights of children and collec@@ ts witness against other cri@@ es , which were exactly as victim of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the shortened version of a report of c@@ tur@@ ally , which is published by Global Vo@@ ices with kind permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ elan , es@@ cu@@ elas Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; Flying cows , dec@@ ay schools &quot; ) , processed by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America and re @-@ released .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household in which she did not eat along with the family that lived there .
just before her studies at the university , she returned to the house once again and heard how the owner of the house full of pride over them . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that , from which something has become , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old she began to work as Cri@@ ad@@ ita in Paraguay more than 46@@ ,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to work at school .
the shop is very simple : a big family with little money transfer her min@@ ded son or her min@@ der@@ year old daughter to another , abundant family . in exchange the child will receive food , a training and a roof over the head .
however , what is not mentioned above , the children must pay for countless days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse may not be raised - and all that is in the framework of a contract that cannot lift up .
this referred to as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go Practice is widespread in Paraguay according to the participation and acceptance by major parts of the society and despite abundant complaints from human rights organisations .
after completing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for an organization that fought for the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ ad@@ itas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testimonies , calculated and den@@ ounced .
she tried to name things in the name , because the feeling of grat@@ itude that is imp@@ lied with cri@@ m@@ ity is guaranteed in general stand@@ still .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ den@@ a .
on the other hand , the family , who has her daughter in the faith that they will improve their training in society and can do something out of itself , &quot; to another family . &quot;
on the other hand , the family is dedicated to the girls and whose exploitation is justified with faith , that they would give someone an opportunity to get someone else and maybe even is hungry .
the Vic@@ tims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
if the girl is har@@ assed , his family becomes many years later .
sometimes they never experienced them .
in January 2016 , the so far unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the bor@@ ough@@ ly in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , but a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín came to the hospital in Ca@@ ñ@@ az@@ a@@ et , her body showed no more violent impacts . shortly afterwards she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ ad@@ ita in the budget of the former Military Tribunal of Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as civil servants at the registration office .
Mar@@ ín lived with them in their home in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
by the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ re@@ ira allegedly killed as long as with a stick to Mar@@ ín , until they suffered dead@@ ly injuries .
this should be the last punishment in life of the young girl .
a few days later , the media reported on the incident .
they decided that the murdered child was a Cri@@ ad@@ ita .
organizations such as UNICEF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the deep in the par@@ agu@@ an Society of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go for the death of the girl .
it recorded the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; several dozen people came to protest violence together and demanded that there was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no other Carolina &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the name of the girl and photos were widespread in the social media .
&quot; in Paraguay more cows are registered as children , &quot; mour@@ ned Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
without papers , it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control , among which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the sp@@ ouses and nearly 60 civil society organisations demanded an ast@@ er@@ ous analysis of the Falls .
they want that Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was sentenced to 30 years in prison .
if the case comes from court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be landmark - when the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go will come to court .
the everyday life of a Cri@@ ad@@ ita
Cri@@ ad@@ itas are not only explo@@ ited as working forces but they are ins@@ ulated by other girls in their old age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ mers that her father worked , bank@@ rupt@@ cy had to register and lost his father &apos;s work .
their brothers had to work all work and started to sell on the street or on the market swe@@ ets to earn money .
they all went on to school .
only Tina was sent as Cri@@ ad@@ ita to the capital As@@ unci@@ on .
in the house of their employer , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours each day .
during this time , they had to share the time so that you still remained time to learn .
she arose every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared breakfast for their employer .
Friday , for example , cle@@ ver the fridge , plaster the living room , polished the furniture and des@@ per@@ ation of the ground .
when the school was at the end , she went home again and had time to learn .
the more time it was done with learning , the more free time had her .
but this time was limited because they had to make a dinner for their employer .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she was never hungry , but got not unlimited food . &quot; I could get more books from the library of the house@@ holder as food from the fridge , &quot; re@@ members them .
the library was well equipped and belonged to the house@@ holder , a former military and sympath@@ izers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party that belonged to the dictatorship of Alfredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
at some departure the goo@@ d@@ r Al@@ var@@ den@@ a to stand next to him and editorial from the opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; or &quot; El Pueb@@ lo . &quot;
in doing so , he tried to convince them to give the reports of the official media about the regime &apos;s regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he held it for intelligent , but did not under@@ go with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the goo@@ d@@ man had found someone who heard about politics while he spoke about politics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they not allowed me to visit my family because they were the opinion that I would have heard there &quot; poor an@@ gu@@ hab@@ its &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; so they supposed that Al@@ var@@ den@@ a belongs to the native group of Guar@@ ani , at home again her native language Guar@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their Lord feared that they had the education that they had allowed to lose it again , explains them .
but it was totally clear that she was for everything she received from them with their hard work .
also at school Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was also discri@@ min@@ ated in school . &quot; a thing about which nearly never spoken , are mo@@ b@@ bing and the sh@@ ik@@ ans of which Cri@@ ad@@ itas are exposed to school .
because the other children have parents , they know immediately that someone who has no parents , is a Cri@@ ad@@ ita .
I was unable to invite home to my house . I had no friends in the school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in time where friends arise , I felt very clear that I was one of the group .
the isolation was the worst of all , &quot; explained Al@@ var@@ den@@ a .
the Company endor@@ se the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook Group in which one can do vac@@ ant requirements for cleaning agents and kinder@@ gart@@ ens in Paraguay .
the administrator of the group is Pep@@ a Kost@@ ian@@ ov@@ sky , a city tour in the District of As@@ unci@@ ón .
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a little companion for my little daughter who plays in the morning and afternoon with her .
learn to learn .
please note you .
starting on Monday , if possible .
the display received five &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the place Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a year @-@ old girl and gave their phone number .
another woman who also came from Ñ@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she loves little children and is very pretty , &quot; he wrote .
in the third commentary by &quot; a girl from the national interior , I want to work . &quot;
then the author of the ad was then once again :
Dear friends , I have found one . I looked about if it works with her .
thank you , I am writing again if something is .
the shop was completed .
in Pro@@ log about the report Cri@@ ad@@ itas , ¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ án@@ do ?
( Cri@@ ad@@ itas , how long still ? ) , a collection of witness statement by former Cri@@ ad@@ itas , writes Or@@ ti@@ z :
in the course of our history we managed to abol@@ ish systems like slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ i ( a practice from the early history of Paraguay ) , the Con@@ qu@@ ist@@ ad@@ ores ( a economic system in Paraguay ) and to support them that many girls and boys had to provide themselves in a system of slavery , with whom they become easy victim for abuse and exploitation .
social ine@@ quality in Paraguay and the vision of power are the key to understanding the phenom@@ ena known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
bill bill writes Egyptian users of social media to register in the government
image of Pix@@ ab@@ ay , modified by Global Vo@@ ices .
published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
sixty Egyptian parliamentary elections recently ordered a bill to &quot; regul@@ ate the regulatory and user of social networks . &quot;
if he is accepted by Parliament , users must register social media in Egypt at a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter .
on the basis of the law , then a place would be set up to use citizen and citizens to share social media .
within six months , with the assum@@ ption of the law , users would have to register and registered users on the site of the site with their correct names and staff numbers to use social networks .
if it be missed to do this , this could bring a penalty of up to six months or a fine of money .
the bill , consisting of six paragra@@ phs , and in local media , including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt is Independent , defines social media as &quot; jed@@ we@@ de Application , which runs over the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice , video setup and text . &quot;
it is un@@ clear how the law is set if it is assumed , since the draft cannot place , such as Egyptian authorities must lay down the user , not in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is not able to ensure the regulation on the level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , member of the parliamentary elections , related to the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a user name and a password to come through the fire@@ wall which blocks Facebook . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt is planning to establish a fire@@ wall on national level around Facebook . due to them , it would be necessary to submit information on its identity to access the network .
but it is not known so far that such plans exist .
experts and experts on site are sk@@ ep@@ tical about the technical fe@@ asi@@ bility of the fore@@ front .
Ram@@ y R@@ ao@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ological ( &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices :
I doubt the technical capacity and the understanding of the neither authority in Egypt concerning things that have to do with technology .
according to my opinion it is so that same as they are violent on physical public and private premises , it could also be done online .
if I feed them , then this means that they will apply a powerful surveillance system to apply for citizens who want to apply a permit or not . and this means a crazy system to monitor the activities of the people and to carry out a judicial process .
that &apos;s technically impossible to realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
in order to be passed by the law , the draft must first be discussed at the legisl@@ ature of Parliament and the Constitutional Court before it enters into the debate .
whether its assum@@ ption and implementation will be successful or not , the draft &quot; stands in line with a pro @-@ military thinking in the Parliament , whose sens@@ es will be maxim@@ ized and ensured that no devi@@ ating an@@ ew is present on the image area , &quot; says R@@ ao@@ of .
last year , Tam@@ er El @-@ Sh@@ ah@@ aw@@ y suggested a bill of law against Cy@@ ber Cri@@ me , who was to be found guilty of life imprisonment for those who are to thre@@ aten to thre@@ aten the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest . &quot;

high above in the mountains of Kurdistan in the nor@@ theastern Iraq region work the shelter H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza and her team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organisation Nature Iraq , to protect the spiritual Persian Leop@@ ards .
a sub@@ type of the larger family of Leop@@ ards , who are occupied by Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian Leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . all in all , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are due to wild animals , loss and fra@@ gment of their hab@@ itat and as they always find less spo@@ ils .
why is this particular type of le@@ op@@ ards so important ?
how R@@ aza in the video shows , &quot; is the Persian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Persian ecos@@ ystem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Kur@@ dish ecos@@ ystem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the health and the growth of the ecos@@ ystem also depends on that a large cat@@ er@@ tier is present . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chance to see a Persian Leop@@ ards actually is really small and goes towards zero . when the team is found in the video , that they all have a recording of a large cat in the camera , R@@ aza breaks out in pure joy .
as illustrated Bi@@ olog@@ in shows R@@ aza passionate about a different side of their country that has not only exists from war and conflict .
she has been involved in field studies for wild animals and on educational programmes of Nature Iraq for six years .
since 2013 , she has also been a member of IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group since 2013 and is preparing to set protection zones for wild animals in the Kurdistan region .

in early March 2017 , the daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ vacc@@ o , the progress made in the North @-@ East Japan , have been forced to re@@ build the life of those in the last six years . a great earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima joined the cat@@ astrophe .
K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ vacc@@ o Newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , in the Pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , the pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was one of the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in Japan &apos;s Nor@@ theast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring pr@@ un@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate were forced displac@@ ed , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had disappear whole coastal cities from the map .
in addition , the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima still experienced a nuclear accident , already alone , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their houses .
the special report of K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ vacc@@ o shows a local point of view that progress has been achieved six years later in order to re@@ build the life of local authorities .
the detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics of the Japanese re@@ constructions and the survey results of the affected themselves .
the housing plant in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ata
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ vacc@@ o Newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned spare parts ( in the set ) , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u , were completed in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could be the largest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , with 80 percent of the planned spare parts .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hima still forms the final light with 70 percent .
there are still six years after the cat@@ astrophe , evacu@@ ated by Beh@@ e@@ fs@@ wald , which had evacu@@ ated evacu@@ ated from Beh@@ avi@@ x@@ ju@@ u@@ ut@@ ak@@ u in the final spare parts .
after the three times cat@@ astrophe , nearly 80 000 people saw themselves forced to live in Beh@@ e@@ form .
in December 2016 still 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such containers .
almost 40 percent of the Fu@@ kus@@ hima living in 2011 still lived in not@@ ions , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was successful . more than 75 percent of the evacu@@ ated , which were shel@@ tered after the disaster in accommodation houses , were settled in final houses .
for I@@ w@@ ate the figure is 34 percent .
the status of works and everyday life in the three concerned pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ vacc@@ o Newspaper was able to have discovered 10@@ 74 from 1100 schools that were affected by evil until December 2016 , which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , the industrial reconstruction of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult .
while nearly 100 percent of the fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i have now been in operation , only 30 percent of the fishing ports have been re @-@ commissioned in Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and nuclear accident , have moved in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agricultural land in large @-@ area .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas , whereby only 66 percent of the farm@@ land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent of the farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hima can be used again .
it is un@@ likely that only a sequence of atomic fact is , because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed farm@@ land of Fu@@ kus@@ hima are located in the nuclear zone of nuclear zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has recovered continuously , but again the Fu@@ kus@@ hima still remains far back .
the tourist figures in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are up to 90 percent of the same stand as before the mis@@ fortune . Fu@@ kus@@ hima still can only have 75 percent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ vacc@@ o Newspaper also reports that since the cat@@ astrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants , it is more difficult to earn their li@@ vel@@ ih@@ ood .
is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake ?
to determine a total image , the newspaper introduced numerous surveys under the native population and among the evacu@@ ated people . she asked them about the state of rest@@ art and also , as their indig@@ nation has changed towards the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in her introduction of the article the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ vacc@@ o Newspaper explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ vacc@@ o led a survey to bring more about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness among the local population in experience .
the survey carried out that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents , measures were taken in order to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.9 percent of respon@@ dents say that still not enough in danger of disast@@ ers .
how it stands out to be evacu@@ ated from the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima
in its issue on the anniversary of the earthquake , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ vacc@@ o Zeitung has strengthened its attention on the situation of evacu@@ ated Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
Fu@@ kus@@ hima still had to experience the massive earthquake and devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima was also witness of the worst , cat@@ astroph@@ es , atomic fact that Japan had ever experienced .
of 160 000 evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima , nearly 63 000 people were displac@@ ed in areas outside the pre@@ fecture .
at the beginning of 2016 , there were more than 23 000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima , in permanent spare parts .
after 2017 , there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hima living outside their home pre@@ fecture .
in the disaster areas , most of the evacu@@ ated areas are still alive , older than 50 years old . you have to come in proper container , because the efforts to re@@ build Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima still have to compete with massive construction projects . this is about construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games , which will be held in Tokyo in 2020 .
the world is small : our po@@ d@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
if people meet people from other countries that speak a different language , the differences may seem to be bigger than the simil@@ ar@@ ities .
however , after a while , you often recogni@@ zes that a more than it seems at first glance .
these global connections are important , since they are able to challenge our advantages , our perspectives and remember that the world ultimately is very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look forward to these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we treat topics , who earn less attention in reporting times than they earn .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected with someone over voice and country borders .
Veron@@ ika Kri@@ con@@ i speaks about the simil@@ ar@@ ities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ i speaks about the time to love the lack of common language skills during a journey in rural China ; Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences he has collected in a small village in Madagascar .

a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered this week to the intensive care unit : last Friday , a police officer had defeated at Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia at a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia around a protest against au@@ ster@@ ity .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , studied social sciences at the Federal University of Go@@ i@@ ás , suffered a skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma and several fragments .
doctors oper@@ ated him on Saturday , and now put it into an artificial Com@@ a .
his condition is considered critical .
the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus which spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days .
on the pictures is also the face of the police officer , which was identified with a strike . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police announced in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended until the end of the investigation of the active service .
the images show the police officer , as he proposes in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his impact on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Luz ) .
would be a police officer of a demonstr@@ ators and on the intensive care unit , his face would be visible for six months in television and the entire repression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ ol@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , divided by Lu@@ iz da Luz , divided by Lu@@ iz da Luz , where you can see how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several sanitary short on it .
another video with the same scenes , but from a different perspective , is also immersed in the social networks .
in the below shown clip you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus down the 50th second .
for Mat@@ eus family , who lives in another state , Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazilian re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 Euros ) to cover a part of the costs for medical treatment and to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia during the hospital .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further non@@ violence against activ@@ ist in Go@@ i@@ ás .
Go@@ i@@ ás experienced a wave of political power : here was the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me Irish from his father , because he had attacked the Occup@@ y Movement in secondary schools , and now we have attacked the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , who has been attacked by a polic@@ emen who struck him with a strike in the face .
police trans@@ missions
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil where it came to the most brutal police operations against demonstr@@ ators last Friday .
police officers set up a stage in protests at the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had built a stage for speakers , Gum@@ mig@@ ra@@ de and Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
the de@@ pu@@ ties of Fl@@ avi@@ o Ser@@ af@@ ini , social and peace @-@ party leaders ( PS@@ OL ) , asking the police to ren@@ ounce violence against demonstr@@ ators .
this also includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country .
once again the Brazilian media prot@@ ru@@ des , by changing the focus on another , unexpected prot@@ agon@@ ists : a window plate .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported specifically about a cr@@ ushed glass windows to create a photo of their title pages .
in contrast , the O Glob@@ o preferred a title story with a set of fire .
there is no pl@@ au@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason , more about a broken window plate than the protests among thousands of people who serve the defense of a special thing .
this must also be seen if you stri@@ ve against any form of atomic damage .
too , the term &quot; V@@ and@@ alism &quot; will also receive a ab@@ sur@@ d , un@@ disp@@ rop@@ or@@ ish significance , and the typical violence of the military police are committed through head@@ lines with the title &quot; demonstr@@ ators on con@@ front@@ ation course with the police . &quot;
the Lost Vill@@ ages to Cuba out of the Ab@@ in@@ du@@ str@@ alization in Cuba
with the introduction of the Act of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , nearly hundreds of sugar cane factories were opened to the doors of Cuba ( Photo : Juli@@ o B@@ atist@@ a )
the parish church Gregori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cub@@ an province of May@@ abe@@ que , is commonly known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill , regardless of that there is no significant sugar @-@ harvest on site .
it is two years ago when the activities were m@@ apped into the sugar cane factories .
after the earth , the sug@@ ar@@ cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory was lost after and after its installations until only the rum@@ ours of steel and concrete remained .
about 272 workers had to be re@@ inv@@ aded .
some changes the work .
other re@@ signed and comm@@ utes a day to the factories which are still m@@ apped .
N@@ ene , a Sol@@ dier veter@@ an , open every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugar pipe industry does not sei@@ ze his sleep .
he heard that it works in the eastern part of the sugar cane factories which are re@@ active after long in@@ active days , because they have been preserved .
that was something that he did not expect .
N@@ ene reminds us that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane Factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar industry resistance have already the pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , the low market prices , the I@@ ne@@ ff@@ icking , the bad administrative decisions and climate change .
in 2016 the production was 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the year 1910 produced .
the news would have been a motive for the country before a few decades , but the bad harvest has already been no novel@@ ty more .
why was the Cub@@ an sugar industry switched off ?
the old railway station of the community saw better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ atist@@ a )
the reduction in the sugar industry sectors was an economical need : the 155 sugar tubes mills were technically ob@@ sol@@ ete , and hardly competitive for the country .
the initial idea was to focus the production on the most efficient factories , the annual production rate was 4 million tonnes .
they only left the factories that can produce sugar for the most 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0,@@ 03 euros ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the moti@@ fs that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar tu@@ b@@ plants and the power crisis on the global market .
nevertheless the sugar price increased from about one decade ago .
from 2017 until 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the report published by the OECD and FAO , Agriculture and Nutrition organisation of the United Nations .
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar cane would generate roughly $ 85 million for the country .
not all ran well
&quot; today the day is going to enter with safety in history , &quot; these were the first words of the Cub@@ an President Fi@@ del Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o .
from there , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the following years the dis@@ closure of a total of 98 sugar tubes factories , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further training .
the same happened in the Gregorian tube factory Gregorian o Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
if N@@ ene is known as a soldier , talking about the closure of the factory , the word that he repeated most repeatedly , &quot; Sc@@ am . &quot;
nearly all respon@@ dents say : not one of them was informed that the factory would shut down .
in order to obtain the place , they were a full @-@ time working group .
in front of the first semester , the first letters began to come .
it was officially un@@ written documents , which would only be found regarding the parts that would be removed , the address of the address and the date .
all were signed by Ul@@ ja Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister for withdrawal .
from there the responsibility was over and the letters were always more common .
Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the l@@ act@@ ate factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money , that he was still in operation .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , wa@@ its for the retirement in another plant , Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was against his will in the stand@@ ings of the factory , whose construction he helped .
with each part he removed , he dis@@ assembled from one of his 31 years of work .
the best developed industrial sector of Cuba and the most important work@@ pieces has been deleted .
in many cases , there were no alternatives to work stations and services that were generated in the municipalities in which they were found .
we will never know if during the mamm@@ oth speech of October 21 , 2002 , the former president in the eyes of the present people saw that factories were not working for the areas whose factories were not working for five years , everything would run well .
the price of the population for the closure of the sugar tubes factories
sugar cane has been extracted only high by grinding .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ atist@@ a )
after two years the parish church Gregori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things changed , but not always to better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory was closed , or better , when they began to beat them , they also list@@ ened to the asphalt road , they also list@@ ens to others .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to search other factories .
they became spare parts .
without a future perspective , many young people left the region at once .
in the area a food factory was created whose production is not used to supply the church .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant remains impressive .
at the end of 2016 N@@ ene came back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work .
nin@@ ety @-@ forty harvest@@ ing the old soldiers bring a pension of two thousand Pes@@ o per month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
LORD N@@ ene , a man black skin colour , small , with few teeth and clear@@ er voice , is not a reas@@ oned person , but he is the lies that they told him not .
they qu@@ el him for ten years .
N@@ ene goes with 65 years in R@@ ente , not because it is missing him by force , but because he is bitter .

first Nations Youth you@@ ths use Hi@@ p @-@ Hop to express itself and receive their own culture

you@@ ths of the first Nations communities in Canada have the subject to deal with topics , which are important for them . do they do with Hi@@ p @-@ Hop , thanks to a number of walking workshops .
since 2014 , as part of the N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an @-@ tour , mobile recording studios can accommodate direct schools and youth centres to provide youth groups Song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live appearances .
the original workshops were led by the Ped@@ agog@@ ues David Hod@@ ges , who lives in Montreal and in North Quebec with ten crew communities and then worked together with the Cre@@ e Hi@@ p Hop Group The North@@ Stars .
the workshop gets that the young particip@@ ates in convers@@ ations issues such as &quot; cultural identity , language , meditation , love , self @-@ acceptable &quot; or whatever is to be found in mind .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos , where the yo@@ ungst@@ ers are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia , and was invited to organize similar workshops with the strain of Win@@ un@@ ev@@ ago in the US state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Y@@ oo in the field of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , called Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; in which nearly two dozen usually indigenous young women have disappeared or murdered .
the cases were not resolved .
the next video of the Nem@@ hi Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video player to mediate , as important to the preservation of traditional customs and customs , despite the influences of glob@@ alization .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people do not always rule the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song we recorded the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation , the refra@@ in will be sung in Cre@@ e .
the young participated in this young people got some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly by the North@@ stars Hi@@ p @-@ Hop Group which gave them a St@@ rop@@ he in the dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .
at the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ side of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an , the st@@ rop@@ he is available in the address , also an translation into English , which is translated here :
sometimes I feel when no one would be interested in me
but I &apos;m trying to go on the earth my days
that is the day when you will take our scre@@ am
because we have lost our way in life
but I believe that we will raise us a day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
so they can grow and lead the same as our youth
so you can do it , what they are the Creator for ?
in the commentary part , the reader and suppor@@ ter of Cre@@ e @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also adds a contribution and adds the st@@ rop@@ he in a silo ( which is also published on his blog and published here with permission ) :

in Japan one can see almost any restaurant of plastic dishes .
to show potential customers , what exactly on the menu bar will be found in the proximity of the entrance @-@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( located in the set , &quot; Plastic models of dishes &quot; ) from any food that will be served in this restaurant .
customers see this plastic put@@ ted and decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of this plastic .
in the T@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi district of K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi there is a multitude of these small enterprises that produce those plast@@ ers , which the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are so commonly that they don &apos;t get them all . a new trend , however , is now transformed into normal mobile accessories and other g@@ ad@@ gets .
at N@@ aver Mat@@ ome , the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i published a series of social media links and photos , which show this unusual tw@@ ist with the sh@@ oc@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now in special sale : new with plastic covered mobile phone bands , as shown in Ki@@ chi@@ jo@@ i Tok@@ y@@ u Kauf@@ haus .
many of these artificial foods were turned to kit@@ schi@@ gen collecting objects , as in this case , refriger@@ ator@@ mag@@ nets :
here are some Sho@@ c@@ ous refriger@@ ator@@ mag@@ nets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom of the Ess@@ enn@@ ines shall become increasingly w@@ alled .
in this case , an ka@@ ans @-@ don ( a popular travel dish with seafood ) has been transformed into a mobile phone stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as cell phone support .
we have also produced this part for the Tokyo exhibition in Tokyo .
and here is an apple , keeping your mobile phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and this is just the beginning of an increasing flight to the Com@@ ic .
some mobile phone support and mobile designers allow you to produce your own artwork . in this case , ik@@ ura or salmon was used , a popular t@@ opping with white rice is served .
on Twitter some users had their doub@@ ts :
is there someone who say : &quot; Wow , cool , now I can manipul@@ ate my mobile phone with laugh@@ ter ? . &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic gr@@ illed can also accept a less appet@@ ite form to surprise visitors or family members un@@ pleasant .

a Mexican project tells stories of the survi@@ vor@@ s of the struggle against the organized crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for victims of fighting against the drug dealers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports in@@ - and foreign media about the inf@@ am@@ ous &quot; struggle against the drugs , &quot; in Mexico , the mis@@ sil@@ ences and the tum@@ ours regularly appear only in statistics . however , this reflected not the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle with themselves .
the coverage of the drug law as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ ells , ur@@ ged the stories of the victims of conflict perfect in the background .
the day after a violent incident looks hardly any person on the fun@@ eral or to those who have learned to live with pain .
there are behind any loan , behind each bone re@@ funds in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories paying parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , their wounds maybe never heal .
that is why the Mexican News portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has called the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; with the drug trading , &quot; ) to give these victims a voice and told stories of people who were in the struggle between the prosecution authorities and cart@@ els .
animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project so :
organizing crimes against us not only fear our lives .
the impact are a lot of pro@@ found .
for example , if shops close because they are threatened by drug dealers and all the congregations will have to drive many kilometers to buy some as milk .
the pain of victims
&quot; &quot; &quot; a video with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que cam@@ bian p@@ or el &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as fears life &quot; ) tells exactly these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father , who sear@@ ches every weekend secret graves after his son .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ guez , who lost her father and two brothers and two daughters to their neph@@ ew on a single day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a priest : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as every sun@@ day we prepare ourselves to the task that we have prepared to go and searching for the graves after the human being we loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 , when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on October 13th he left the house .
on October 15th he should return again , but he never returned . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very difficult for me , because I &apos;m now with three children who need a training .
there is also my mother , who is also here with me .
at the moment it has no income .
it is the insurance of my Father , but they won &apos;t pay them out because they ask a death certificate .
where should we get that ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vi@@ vi@@ r con el nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
we don &apos;t just need to show the faces of those who are afraid of fear . we must show the international community , the conflict , the frag@@ ility and the state control .
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some ex@@ cer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ HB , a reading of Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the State of Gu@@ err@@ ero in Central D@@ iko .
their contribution reminds us that violence should never be considered normal , no matter whether in which form it occurs :
I &apos;ve been familiar with illness and Sens@@ ational journ@@ alism now for some years .
I pass at newspaper ki@@ os@@ ken every day and see the cover page with pictures , which actually can only come from a textbook for crimin@@ ology or from Ak@@ ten of specialists .
it takes me from the version .
sometimes I have the feeling , as if I am the in@@ car@@ nal , or sad . it acts as a lack of respect to the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be equal , or consider that this is normal .
she writes on :
no , it is not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin wants to be great , if it &apos;s big . and it is not normal that people can hear about the &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets .
for me , when they were those who have lost someone who lost someone and those who have feared that they also happens something like that .
I see our weakness , when stories become naked numbers in a statistic only .
the facts on men is incredible for me when death of six people and the dis@@ appearance of 43 students in a neighboring village may be justified that they were &quot; wake @-@ up . &quot;
I think they are trying to talk that they are not spar@@ ed by such trage@@ dies , if they don &apos;t touch and still be silent .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution &quot; Four months Re@@ pressing in the Capital distri@@ butions : as a family re@@ pl@@ under@@ ed as a family with dr@@ au@@ ctions . it describes how the armed crimin@@ als did not destroy money from their business , until they did not only destroy its business , but also their family are torn apart .
you think all that you have lost and about how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain never goes , the g@@ rief remains , the anxi@@ ety comes up again , if you are alone .
hab@@ its have changed , phone numbers also .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the more we are removed , the better .
she completed her report with the words :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to be arrested for the others , because you don &apos;t know when they will lead you or kill . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I asked me in these terrible days , if there would be my deep roots feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot to do what you cri@@ es . I have to learn to live with pain .
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the contribution &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation of violence . &quot;
in the introduction he designs any questions regarding : who car@@ es for the child of a missing wife and a man who was killed by organized crime ?
how is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mex@@ ic@@ os ?
he is not like other boys of his age whose parents take care of them .
Br@@ yan is a f@@ ather@@ less and nar@@ rates that he makes himself a egg , cooked potatoes , tortillas , tortillas , and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of fl@@ ac@@ ons with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every year .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for the whole life of violence and who had to learn to live so .
when he was five years old , one told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day that his childhood ended .
his childhood was over two years before , when he was only a few blocks away from his home , the bloody dead bodies of his father , who had been shot by armed men from a pre@@ occupied car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez was seen as follows :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , when violence through the organized crime and fighting against it , with the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most vulner@@ able city in the world due to the number of murder on public security and government of the United States government .
in 2010 alone , the public prosec@@ utor had 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to an average of 8.5 Mor@@ den per day .
these are only a few of thousands of stories that organized the organized crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country .
just a few stories live in view of the new head@@ lines . but this project reminds us of those who are not forgotten .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co , &quot; Nar@@ co@@ data project has launched the data journ@@ alism project , whose aim is to present the complex information behind the failed struggle against drugs , which has tor@@ tured the country in the last four decades , in a wise manner .
if a painting is worth a thousand words
&quot; Sh@@ aring is Car@@ ing &quot; of Fli@@ ck@@ r users Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ ING : this contribution and the pages , to whom it linked , include pictures , on which violence is represented .
the fact check is important in a moment in which it is about to raise a rum@@ or to ex@@ lar@@ ch a f@@ ake .
but how is it that the first time is di@@ pped ? content in social media , regardless of whether or true , tend to exist .
let this photo of a terrible accident in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) seven years ago .
since its first publication , it has been used to identify potentially explosive atmosph@@ eres which actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false copy of image and event - &quot; wrong text &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Draft News - denied not the fact that there are plenty of careful reporting about events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but there are questions about our desire to get images to messages .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 a tank car entered the town of S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , til@@ ted and explo@@ ded . 230 people died .
after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country was neg@@ lec@@ tured and devast@@ ated . the streets in the region became dangerous paths full of impact , which were difficult to ride .
in addition to the tank , the cargo car fell victim to the tank .
political representative described a fire ball , the dozens of houses contained , including a cinem@@ as close to people who was full of people who illustr@@ ate the FIFA World Cup .
the houses are bri@@ dging and stolen bodies in the streets .
many people were burned to un@@ aware .
a painting with the title &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur users Myst@@ ical Monkey , January 12 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident depic@@ ts the gray scenes of this day .
above is an example .
it shows rows of carbon@@ ized body which are m@@ apped to the ground during persons .
but here the story does not find its end .
over the years , the same photo was en@@ ched several times on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms , but true , real but not in the context of the trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , the com@@ bat@@ ants of the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the un@@ le@@ gen@@ ic villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
Aug@@ enz@@ eu@@ gen reported dra@@ stically the atro@@ cities which they had to flee .
houses and shops were burnt down and bodies were burned in roads and using .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were mass@@ ac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one remained back to count bodies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many were tender , shot or burned .
only on satellite images could be illustrated the fol@@ ly time .
the reason for the attack was also un@@ resolved , but the army @-@ based war in Bagh@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and an attempt to win the B@@ oko Har@@ am , country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture from the DR Kongo back again , as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack was presented :
that is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this mis@@ er@@ ical use of the image of the DR Kongo is only one in a number of failure ; Africa Check has been docum@@ etary orders to Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the picture was taken as a cover for mass strike .
another step further bring out personal comments , such as the image from the DR Kongo on the sources of mass media in connection to provide arguments .
the p@@ inc@@ eption also occurred in combination with the dead@@ ly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar in Myanmar .
according to a flash , published by the United Nations , those who could flee , rape and some dead , some of burning .
while others reported about the violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Post@@ s reported like the following descriptions associated with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture was taken by an Saudi Arabian News page , which claimed 2012 , the President My@@ an@@ m@@ ars Th@@ ein being told , mon@@ ks and politicians had participated in the assassination of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from the DR Congo to modify this information .
the original contribution , which was accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be called here .
other news agencies , the AF@@ P as their source , had also been wrong with this statement , but did not have the image taken from the DR Congo in connection .
the worldwide range of false information
tracks of these wrong coupling dates back to the years 2011 and 2012 and come from anywhere in all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; returned image search &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can see how far more information can be exceeded . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a converted photo search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found less than 18,@@ 8 billion images ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) 344 images , which are similar to the said image of the DR Congo .
they come from a mixed mas@@ ch of private pages , platforms social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some false reports have passed , have taken another attempts to escape the for@@ g@@ ings .
we have listed examples for the miss@@ ile usage and associated with the respective countries , based on which page it had been published . thus , we want to display the reach clearly than by the language alone .
several examples from the listed countries ( which were joined together in some cases ) may have several examples of mis@@ use .
here are some cases which can now be felt completely ( on the map in orange ) :
map : News Fr@@ ames .
country examples of wrong coupl@@ ings of the image from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange @-@ ceased countries point on pages or server , about the examples of fal@@ si@@ fications or fal@@ seh@@ ood are still available .
the countries in grey are examples according to met@@ ad@@ ata and information that are available via Tin@@ der@@ &apos;s , probably also for@@ age examples .
as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Algeria , 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a link to the image from the DR Congo was posted on an online discussion forum in an online discussion forum ) as part of a thread to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war of Buddh@@ ist Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

t@@ wit@@ ter@@ ments after the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am as this here , the picture of the DR Congo used to illustr@@ ate the &quot; atro@@ cities of Islam , &quot; clearly shows no pages like the Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster that contra@@ di@@ ct this .

Myanmar , 2017 .
as a consequence , the Government of Myanmar published a judge of what they came as &quot; inten@@ tionally , messages and photos which came to international media , international human rights organisations and governments in an attempt to create mis@@ understanding regarding Myanmar . &quot;
this condition , which has been published solely on English , also includes references to f@@ ake pictures of rum@@ ours that kill H@@ ate Spe@@ ech and disp@@ ers@@ ed by extrem@@ ist groups , to present that Muslims Budd@@ hist@@ s kill and elsewhere ( what often used by bur@@ m@@ ese national@@ ists ) .

this post , which addressed to the members of the Russian Orthodox Church , is clear that the picture of the DR Kongo shows Muslims who Christians kill Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein seems to have been involved in 2012 that mon@@ ks and politicians had been involved in killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims , and brought the story together with the p@@ liers .
the article has been updated 2014 and is currently included in this release .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article was published in 2014 about students who had been killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the Catholic close news page An@@ á@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , has explicitly stated that the image is not of the red@@ ness , but it claims that it has a &quot; similar way @-@ dist@@ ic attack . &quot;
in connection with the massacre of the B@@ oko Har@@ am of 2015 in circulation , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to resist that there were connections to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Y@@ an@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ y@@ a@@ u@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria bur@@ ns the world ) .
the picture of the DR Congo appeared with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and dissolved a discussion under Muslims after the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and on the stop at Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve that their communities took these events , which took place in the name of Is@@ l@@ ams , a major attention in the name of the Is@@ l@@ ams .
United States , 2015 .
the picture was band@@ ed to the Mass@@ oko of the B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 ( and more than 9.@@ 300 times saving ) , but the messages that were associated with them were detected in any religious context .
instead , the goal was to raise the attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of the media reports compared to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Vietnamese ) , 2014 .
after a message has been written by a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; god@@ father Juan Carlos Mart@@ os &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , in circulation , discussion for@@ ums like this here in Vietnamese and declared it to Fal@@ se . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the embassy that contained the picture from the DR Congo , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ iner mission@@ aries and god@@ father Juan Carlos Mart@@ os .
there are further confirmed examples of a def@@ ective use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
for other Ac@@ counts , aggreg@@ ators and pages in the following countries ( in the portfolio in grey ) shows Tin@@ Eye also , but are not fully tra@@ ce@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with UR@@ Ls and time / date stamp exist on the Web@@ cra@@ wler and disp@@ ers@@ ed them via image file names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original accident of 2010 , the picture finally carries a correct description but the original fee is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two strong topics or frames ( floo@@ ding ) , which make this post navigation . the first frame is focusing on religion .
the photo was used in terms of major discussions about silence in connection with the ex@@ h@@ ort@@ ation of Christians or the defense of Muslims - the ex@@ h@@ ort@@ ation of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hist@@ s .
a second Fr@@ aming uses the image to discuss how an African life is assessed compared to a European or French life .
religion understand and the value of human life is both important . therefore it is worth to examine how images are used in connection with these efforts .
however , a deeper question is what happens if readers cannot give this pictures longer faith .
with social media , there are only some people who un@@ intended to exercise the water around a tragedy .
sug@@ ar@@ ising this mood of mis@@ sil@@ es and fal@@ seh@@ ood , that actual atro@@ cities are true and tast@@ es the actual grass of what actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar in Myanmar ?
the spreading of for@@ ci@@ ble images was already deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
a argument is that the re@@ tention of images of a ref@@ usal comes to recognize the tragedy . sometimes these pictures will even be required by the victims .
at the same time , care is that there are for@@ ci@@ ble pictures reader and spectators and give them the ability to feel emp@@ ath@@ y ( such as this study , who visited how for@@ ci@@ ble media must work on it , others ) .
while there are many as many for@@ ci@@ ble represent@@ ations in the news media , fact that it is indisp@@ ens@@ able for the current News report .
Techn@@ ologists experim@@ enting with algorith@@ ms to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News . &quot; they will be thoroughly thinking about the situation in which a picture can actually become a little sug@@ ary , but actually replaced by the context or in totally miss@@ ile species .
any investigation of false supplements should also be considered internationally as internationally .

the &quot; Un@@ tran@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uni@@ qu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo of Andy Simmons to operate in accordance with CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. un@@ mist@@ ak@@ able ) ende@@ av@@ able to offer voice enthusi@@ astic a selection of words from all over the world , which are difficult or not to translate at all .
such words are in any language : they press some situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these un@@ mist@@ ak@@ able words are already well known today ( like the famous Portuguese Saudi de ) and others who are deeply ro@@ oted in a special culture ( for example , the Spanish slow@@ s ) .
but all resist hard against any attempt of a simple translation .
a word or expression is not sufficient , which is why a full explanation and sometimes a bit context is required to understand exactly what is meant with this one word .
these unique words have been collected in an online list for all time .
most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to concentrate on small languages .
in the blog you can find words from the category of V@@ anu@@ at@@ u , like :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Bem@@ ze you in recognition of your parents in recognition of your younger years .
and words in the H@@ uns@@ ric Language which are spoken in parts of Brazil such as :
&quot; truck &quot; - Con@@ veni@@ ence or f@@ aul@@ ty , which will feel after you have dar@@ ed in cold days in the sun .
in Bir@@ ds own words from his blog About :
she de@@ compos@@ e other cultures , un@@ veil other things and we@@ aken our cur@@ i@@ osity .
sometimes you can influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page yet would like to publish more of this &quot; un@@ mist@@ ak@@ able &quot; words , and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are .
speakers of the &quot; Treasure Languages , &quot; which are appreciated by Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload your favorite words here .

like Sri Lanka with the worst flood disaster in the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka has seen the worst flood of flood disaster in this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ sun , which usually places the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ ac@@ ag@@ alu O@@ ya in 15 districts moved to the south and west of the country on the shore .
after a position of the disaster centres of Sri Lanka of 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and nearly hundreds of people are missing because of the floods and sl@@ ud@@ ge .
more than 400 000 people have been affected last Friday ( 26 May ) and approximately 100 000 people have been brought to 304 safe destinations .

it was used in January . I took part in San Francisco in San Francisco with a neighbour and love girl in San Francisco .
I trust in my four year old daughter , she tru@@ sts to me her children , she is my rock in the surf .
in one minute , we are calling for the rights of women .
in the next release , we add rights for trans@@ gender .
we are located in a sea of umbre@@ llas and people , some hold the ic@@ onic picture of a woman with head@@ scarf , bound from an American flag , other sk@@ en@@ code slo@@ gan@@ s against Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my gir@@ l@@ friend looks at me and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things do not affect you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslim ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I already led this entertainment .
people who have been working or people who know me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built up in her conception .
they were mus@@ cular to me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see any equal .
we pract@@ ising our religion differently .
we identi@@ fies us to be a Muslim , on different kind . but somehow we are all plug@@ ged into the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is well constructed in our collective idea that once they were Muslims , which can &apos;t be cleaned there .
mus@@ cl@@ ed to be emp@@ ath@@ ed
I don &apos;t think so alone .
that &apos;s even the poet , whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what images are in the sense when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
when Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I &apos;m now , he was an orthodo@@ x Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Quran , and Prophet Muhammad , died up to the day where he died , the center of his poetry .
but in the western introduction , religion Rum@@ is was deleted as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this extin@@ ction is a major part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another exists in the induc@@ tive paintings of Muslims , western books already existed since centuries .
this temp@@ ting language is determined by the dark man that fear should fear and the exotic woman who was to save .
the landmark Palestinian scientist Edward S@@ aid represented the story behind this pictures in the 1970s .
but these pictures also rise up today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood they continue to stop them .
I have been working in the news industry for thirteen years and I have seen how to domin@@ ate this powerful , def@@ ective Nar@@ rative our news@@ fe@@ eds .
this Nar@@ rati@@ onal over@@ sh@@ rub the reality that in the last three decades nine Muslim women have led their countries , while the United States could not choose their first female presidential candidate .
this Nar@@ rati@@ onal fail@@ ing to recognize that when French , Muslim women are hin@@ dered to wear and su@@ ce@@ de @-@ Arab , Muslim women to cover their entire body , that both are both sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group practice his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this severe an@@ rati@@ onal g@@ atory Muslim women to lead movements for change .
it looks like that the first Muslim prayers had been spoken to the American soil of Afri@@ cans , which were brought to this way with slave .
it del@@ etes the existence of Que@@ er Muslims .
this Nar@@ rati@@ v has occupied our collective pre@@ forms of der@@ art deeply and def@@ ici@@ ently , that often S@@ ik@@ h @-@ males and children are often in@@ tim@@ ed to target in@@ tim@@ epi@@ ped attacks and attacks .
because of these stories , which we tell and tell the way we tell them , Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; others . &quot;
among the 1.7 billion belong
in the news industry we can do more than just stories that are based on facts .
or to alternative facts .
we also create Nar@@ rative , who help us to understand the world .
and my industry is di@@ ver@@ ted to capture the Nar@@ rati@@ onal of the 1.7 billion .
and we are concerned here where seven million Muslims who are in the highest degree &quot; diverse &quot; religious group in America . &quot;
more than one @-@ third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ ins@@ ulated Americans .
six out of ten American Muslims belong to the immig@@ rants of the first generation that come from 77 countries .

four decades ago , my first parents came to live in New York to live their American dream .
my mother made her first jew@@ ellery design in 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; Wol@@ k@@ enk@@ rat@@ zer were made by the Muslim , American st@@ atics from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
at that time , when Khan thought out the Sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were indig@@ nant and Americans .
but am I un@@ mist@@ ak@@ able Mus@@ lim@@ a and American ?
sometimes , when people ask me why I don &apos;t ask for por@@ k , I say - instead of my Muslim recipes or take my hand@@ y@@ att@@ ain@@ ees , who bear all Muslims with respect - &quot; from respect to Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
I dun@@ gh@@ ed , we do not bear all pocket aces with us .
we must also have no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or to be chosen by almost always for additional security checks at the airport .
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim schol@@ ars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who ende@@ av@@ oured to fight far spread about the Islam .
these lies are produced on the running volume of a well @-@ ador@@ ned Islam@@ op@@ tically machines with cash equi@@ p@@ ments , Th@@ ink @-@ Tanks and Experts for Fal@@ sch@@ information , which is our already faul@@ ty picture of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is manipul@@ ated .
due to the stories that we tell and tell the way , in which we tell them , Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia consists of more than just a fore@@ igner who under@@ take the head cloth .

I want to explain that .
I was born as Mus@@ lim@@ a , but I was born in my pre@@ ference force when I was four years old when I was four years old in a provisional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious life , they reach the following terms : belief , behaviour and affili@@ ation .
my Muslim faith and behavior are maybe not visible , but they are there .
perhaps my gir@@ l@@ friend would see my neigh@@ bor , my rock in the surf , that I can see Mus@@ lim@@ a when they could separate through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the all@@ ab@@ infinite rit@@ ual with my daughter when I kept silence in my arms and her Arab verses to protect the Arab verses to protect the coral and the Q@@ ul@@ s are called .
I repeat for three times every of them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I therefore , because they are protected from evil , the evil one can see , and the evil which one can not see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my Muslim faith is probably not visible , but my Muslim belonging is always part of my shadow .

use approved .
belonging to my grand@@ mother is the image of my grand@@ mother &apos;s grand@@ mother with their sisters , as they had to win a contest of art of floral design in Kar@@ achi .
it is the picture of her that I slept in this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by their finished and un@@ finished paintings with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters , which can be almost extensively .
Mus@@ lim@@ a means to speak the prayers that she had said to me if I have a bad day .
Mus@@ lim@@ a must be in it as she has taught me to say to God : Allah Mi@@ an what God means , my only Lord .
for a people , which was founded over centuries - by a &quot; Empire &quot; colonial @-@ colonial company , founded a company with the name of hon@@ our@@ able British Ost@@ ini@@ dien @-@ Kom@@ pan@@ ie , it has a deep significance to call God my only master .
the author 1987 with her grandfather .
use approved .
affili@@ ation means to grow up and to hear that men are not crying , but at the same time that my beloved grandfather weeping cri@@ es .
in mid @-@ war , while he writes books about modern Islam and the independence of K@@ asch@@ mir@@ s , N@@ ana J@@ aan wept un@@ surrounded by his family in India , K@@ ash@@ mir , family , which he did not close in its arms in half century .
belonging to know that there are millions Kur@@ ds and Palestinians whose families were torn apart from the country of col@@ oni@@ alists , who have dealt the Muslim world like the game risk .
Mus@@ lim@@ a means to know that in the last two centuries , Europeans have seen all up to four Muslim countries . &quot;
it means that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of history was rejected in a century above a Muslim country .
it means to know that at the same time the grandfather of my Grand@@ mother , an in@@ edi@@ an , lam@@ in@@ arian sub@@ tan of the British Empire , was called as &quot; dangerous &quot; because he led the first mosque in England .
even before there was air@@ crafts , he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever been and preaching the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

towards my Muslim tribe of the 1.7 billion , deep in our unforgettable family trees are back ; our un@@ displac@@ ed history .
it means to remember that fourteen years ago the most powerful army of the world , with troops , spread over every continent , apart from Antar@@ c@@ tica , to pursue mass destruction in Iraq , non @-@ exist@@ ent .
it means that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried among the ruins of the war .
an American Mus@@ lim@@ a means to know that the self @-@ mor@@ ate in veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means that if a tragedy off the USA and the susp@@ ects of a Muslim name bears the story of four times more than a story with a white attack .
it means to know that four hundred years ago the first prayer call , Az@@ aan , was called by one delivered black slaves with the name of Bil@@ al .
it means to know that two hundred years ago an African Islam@@ ist named Bil@@ ali Prophet has been reconc@@ iled and brought to this country .
it means Mal@@ col@@ m X to name an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people over@@ crow@@ ded the airports to fight against the Muslim ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand for our dreams and if we say goo@@ db@@ ye to black life .
an American woman , a c@@ ah@@ ari , a c@@ ah@@ ari , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , represents the inher@@ ent inter@@ sec@@ tional@@ ity of our multilingual ident@@ ities , but to fail to communicate them on others .
the Nar@@ rati@@ onal of the 1,7 billion hide more possibilities than a magic cubes , but is represented in the reduced branch &quot; we &quot; against &quot; them . &quot;
one mother means to be my child , and all Muslim children , well @-@ knowing that ma@@ ison@@ ous and privileged people establish on this two @-@ quality Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia .
structural Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia exists in the Muslim regi@@ sters , which began with President Bush and grew up in President Obama .
it exists in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it exists in the immig@@ rant , who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it consists of a country that its borders with people from just over the countries closes it bom@@ bed .
it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; no @-@ fly list , &quot; which takes largely Arab@@ ians and Muslims .
we are the wars that we lead and the bombs we throw to Muslim countries .
due to the stories that we tell and due to those who do not tell us we are here today .
in a study with the title Asc@@ ent of Man , scientists of the North@@ western University participants showed a scientific image and asked them to assess groups on a scale of 1 to 100 as regards evolution .
Muslims received the lowest score .
the conversation which we have to lead
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deep to reveal the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are back for decades to recognize the roots of our fears and the incorrect and dangerous aspect ratio that we inter@@ actions in our news inter@@ actions .
at least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims within the media industry , trying to capture our multiple d@@ ash ident@@ ities and forgotten history .
the po@@ d@@ cast lake Som@@ e@@ thing , Say Som@@ e@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the po@@ d@@ cast # Good@@ Mus@@ lim@@ estone ; the vir@@ al video erie Secret Li@@ ves , a initiative , multiply Muslim authors to print and Ms Mar@@ vel , the pak@@ ist@@ ani , Muslim , American super@@ hero - all this makes me hope .
screen@@ shots of media initi@@ atives that want to show complexity and inter@@ sec@@ tional@@ ity of American life .
coll@@ age of author .
but I am concerned about this difficult global time point where we are located .
and at this moment , consequences has to go beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is a reason that con@@ spi@@ racy the@@ or@@ ists who existed in the dark corners of the Internet now lead the White House .
they have grown exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally because they were Muslims at &quot; other . &quot;
there is another group that has grown exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally by making it &quot; others &quot; created .
a few years ago she had not yet given them ; now they have rule major areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the re@@ alities and the history , which I was not aware of , when I was so old now , as I was now my daughter , but who made me today become an un@@ disp@@ uted Muslim .
things I have left here like a baking stone lane in my speech .
things you may wake up memories , because in all the inter@@ sec@@ tions that make our humanity the story likes to listen to another &quot; others . &quot;
just now , at the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , Con@@ vers@@ ations will take place at the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia .
more than 100 academ@@ ics speak about our problems with the &quot; other &quot; , &quot; structural rac@@ ism &quot; and &quot; American mil@@ itar@@ ism . &quot;
but these are no terms with which we usually have to throw us in our schools or who we read in our papers .

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
why do I tell that at this T@@ ED@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who has shown us how wars are led and people through the Sch@@ affen of the &quot; others &quot; in the public screening , four decades themselves scientist of Stan@@ ford was .
we have to ask ourselves un@@ comfortable questions according to the role of what my gir@@ l@@ friend and I think in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the occupation that we have had a new future , in which we had no president , the chocolate cake has bom@@ bed , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion beyond .
it starts here with all of us .
today initiative for nar@@ rative art wants to store urban variety
history collection , by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ User Daniele Rossi , based on license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a way , here and now in spite of any language barrier with someone else in connection ?
for Steven Bird and Ro@@ by@@ n Perry , the fo@@ unders of the Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) is an answer to stories in their original language .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Global Vo@@ ices reported a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Global Vo@@ ices &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about a different initiative by Steven Bird , the un@@ mist@@ ak@@ able Blog . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written word but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to maintain and pro@@ claim the language variety of big cities .
indeed , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in Oak@@ land , where T@@ LS has already carried out events since 2015 , the risk that small and not so small languages are not given to those born there .
to the makers of the Project :
the mass mortality of the world may be avoided if we are able to accept cities - secure spaces in which residents must not forget to be eligible for .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening often is connected to understand &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these events instead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listen to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listen to feel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format history , history of history initially set their history in their own language , or explain it then to English .
although the participants are not a professional history of history , their commitment and their presentation will result in the hearing of the audi@@ ences .
they call laugh@@ ter and emotions out when the language is no longer a barrier .
for example , the following video shows a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round the history of history of R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate also takes the opportunity to explain the customs of customs of art .
in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the f@@ use of h@@ asen and the P@@ avian in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
&quot; &quot; &quot; after he explains the significance of his f@@ encing , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how is that to talk to an audience who does not understand your language ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a wide gr@@ in@@ sen , he divi@@ des his feeling of emotions : &quot; &quot; &quot;
they have heard !
they were atten@@ tive ...
they were all with me !
so far , the events of the Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling have taken place in three cities , and the organizers hope to expand this . all who are inspired by the project can be informed with T@@ LS in order to organize your own history of history .
Puerto Rico calls on state debt of the state debt
with the aim of a re @-@ test of public debt of Puerto Rico , which amount to 72 million US dollars , participated in a mass demonstration on April 3 , 2017 . the march of march kick@@ ed off at pu@@ ert@@ or@@ ic Capit@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the Old Town of San Ju@@ ans .
it was proclaimed by group@@ ing &quot; Fr@@ ente Ci@@ ud@@ ad@@ ano p@@ or la Au@@ dit@@ or@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( Civil Front for the Neur@@ at@@ ement of debt ) and the ec@@ umen@@ ical Church meeting Puerto Ric@@ os .
the advoc@@ ate of the re@@ proof of debts have also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
the People of Puerto Ric@@ os ur@@ ges that the politicians , banks and government agencies who are responsible for the debt of responsibility for their corruption .
we call for a financial inspection and a Ste@@ ering Committee without personal interests in public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions , corresponding to the economy .
we are pressed and supp@@ ressed .
the people of Puerto Ric@@ os ref@@ uses to pay a debt , which is not their .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pension@@ ers will not take up with sin@@ king pension payments .
we require immediate action .
the island - not in the state of state territory of the United States - suff@@ ers from a severe financial crisis .
hence the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; an independent non @-@ profit organization without party status with focus on soci@@ o@@ economic development , a law to state responsibility , as an alternative to existing state view .
these are their reasons :
Puerto R@@ os Economic and Financial Crisis requires a wide restructuring of state infrastructure .
measures are carried out from the outside without the participation and convic@@ tion of citizens risk to be threatened by the people .
the demonstration called the name &quot; Nach@@ tw@@ ache for Light and Truth . &quot;

the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web developer Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bas@@ sel Saf@@ adi , has been missing since more than one year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives have continued the campaign for his freedom and remin@@ ding the contributions which he has made for an open net .
at this year &apos;s re : PU@@ BL@@ ICA , which is held annually at the annual Conference for digital culture that will be held in Berlin , devoted an event to the # Free@@ Bas@@ sel campaign .
Mé@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist who is produced in France @-@ based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , Managing Director of the book Cost of Freedom in three to five days , covers ex@@ cer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Colle@@ ctive In@@ tranet ( The cost of freedom : a collective research ) .
the book written in the last year and is available here licensed , includes a series of essays that deal with free culture in the presence of the repression .
it is a tribute to Bas@@ sel and his work .
in the introduction , it is :
this book would like to learn how to build open knowledge and what are the true cost , with which this is connected .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors , who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked on page to view over the fog , which gives our news@@ fe@@ eds to create something from our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to liber@@ ate Bas@@ ket@@ ch@@ il , beloved and celebrated Internet volunte@@ er , who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15 , 2012 .
his name was cancelled from the directory of the A@@ dra prison that he sat on October 3 , 2015 .
since then we have no information about his current state or of residence .
the introductory part of his book with the title Colle@@ ctive memory gives his friends and his family a voice to know his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom .
to see how Bas@@ sel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us will begin to think about their own dest@@ in@@ ies , deeds and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what have we chosen for us ?
what have we abandoned in this process of temporary extreme belie@@ fs ?
the web developer of Open Source and digital activ@@ ist has been in the Syrian government authorities since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bas@@ sel was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution , to an unknown place .
his wife , the writer and lawyer in N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi reported that the &quot; Military Police Bas@@ sel had taken the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ ha@@ zi reported that she was contacted on 12 November 2015 by individuals who were committed himself as an in@@ sider the Assad government and having regard them by a alleged death sentence against her husband .
however , its position and condition remain unknown .
a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bas@@ sel played a decisive role in incorpor@@ ating the access to the internet and knowledge of the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist , and currently over@@ lap the director of the New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that formed the Bas@@ sel , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bass@@ els cultural prototypes were fo@@ stered as the work that he started with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually construct the ancient ruins of the Pal@@ m@@ yr@@ as .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross@@ cross of numerous civilians and here &apos;s Greek @-@ Roman architectural types with hi@@ ther@@ ly traditions and Persian influences .
at that time , at that time , he could not know that ten years after working with this work , the IS would put everything , this architecture , not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens , but the world em@@ bo@@ died .
this strip in the digital archae@@ ology and the conservation has created a time capsule which will be open to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future of in@@ valuable value .
in this way , Bas@@ sel was not able to close this project .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of their man to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison :
I spent my whole life to dream of freedom and Bas@@ sel taught me to emb@@ race her .
I am overwhel@@ med if I call his name .
Bas@@ sel brought me English , even when he was already in prison .
I learned to read English well , to write and speak English .
he always has his knowledge with everyone who has asked . he has taught other detention , English to read and speak .
Bas@@ sel opened me the gate to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet at .
he also brought other in@@ ges , as they use computers at least , at least theore@@ tically , without having actually held one in their hands .
G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a commission that she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 , when he was in prison .
Bas@@ sel and N@@ our@@ a have worked together in the book for a year .
she sang the lyrics by him when she visited him and he translated them from the Arab to English .

here an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a titled &quot; It is happening &quot; :
it happens during each visit ,
I sing in the world of your enchanting eyes ,
that I lose my mind in the moment , in which we emb@@ race poor ,
that each of the d@@ angers is no matter ,
each of f@@ ences , bo@@ ilers and gu@@ ardi@@ ans
I sang the pris@@ ons of the prison
and I turn to every detail of your voice and words .
what I carry with me with passion ,
if thine eyes fail to say
and I leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I return rapidly to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to get all the moments ,
and to weep and to smile .
I testify to myself that I will return soon ...

today we repeat our demand in hope that we have to do this for the last time .
Moz@@ ambi@@ que : infr@@ in@@ gement of corruption on pre @-@ tax office due to corruption
Moz@@ ambi@@ que re@@ acted with wrath on a corruption in which a government member returned to the workplace in the state apparatus by which the corruption was committed .
this is the di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other def@@ endants with four other def@@ endants .
the money came from public funds at the airports of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , whose Council Cam@@ b@@ aza between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 because of a good leadership and immediately called his re @-@ setting into the company , which was then on 19 April .
in accordance with a statement by the General At@@ tor@@ ney of the Republic , which evaluated the request , there wouldn &apos;t be an obst@@ acle for Cam@@ b@@ aza , to return to his old post , as the company did not agree to discipline .
however , many residents do not use the action well .
the Centre for Public integrity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution which provides for public transparency , sentenced to an interview with the Deutsche Welle , decision to set the company &apos;s decision :
represents a set@@ back in the struggle against corruption and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and even a step in regard to the efforts of our legal system , the C@@ IP .
what we estimate is that the company should have been creating a discipl@@ in@@ ar@@ ction proceedings against the tra@@ iling list .
however , the company was silent , however , does not apply adequate legal steps to use the corresponding functions .
Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a major voice in the Mos@@ ambi@@ que social media , re@@ jects this behavior , and consider the case as &quot; rebel@@ li@@ ous &quot; :
if Cam@@ b@@ aza was a competent type , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to prison and half of them had to eat half .
he could hold lectures and motiv@@ ating words , he could advise and shot his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he has accepted to re@@ integrate it into the company which he saved harm .
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza is glad@@ ly paid for his silence .
resi@@ due !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mos@@ ambi@@ ence and Student of Political Science in Brazil , says the director no Mor@@ al :
Cam@@ b@@ aza is rewarded by the state , because he won &apos;t bel@@ t@@ ted him that one has rewarded someone in such way that the state has already ended so massi@@ vely .
Cam@@ b@@ aza is missing the Mor@@ al and to serve the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but has only served themselves in the state .
Cam@@ b@@ aza used the state to be a in@@ exhau@@ st@@ ible money source and the state itself is tired of being tired and finally was condemned to a long term of imprisonment .
hon@@ est@@ ly , I don &apos;t know why this man was rewarded .
Fran@@ ce@@ y Ze@@ ú@@ te is preferred to remember the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , Sam@@ ora F@@ el to remember that a thief has belonged to prison :
th@@ iev@@ es include in the prison Sam@@ ora Mak@@ el the Moz@@ ambi@@ que is not only staying for ever as the first independent president in memory , but also as a sharp , trimm@@ ing and - Inci@@ dentally - Proph@@ etic Red@@ ner .
one of his most famous oral represent@@ ations , when he was energet@@ ically confirmed that &quot; an ambitious man should be able to be able to sell his own individual interest , to sell his own individual interest . &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said : &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that it is not so . he changes the tac@@ tic , but he does not change his am@@ itions .
an ambitious man is a crime &quot; at the same time . &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also dis@@ closed :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he sat down for 10 years and was free .
and today it sets him the company , in which he was a schol@@ ar , again under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ OM@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - for gr@@ ates . ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) , May 12 , 2017

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cen@@ sored many users to wrong
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; signi@@ fies K@@ ich@@ er@@ erb@@ ach or Sp@@ acy .

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their posters from the net , because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; ab@@ stain@@ ed .
even though the origin of the Word is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people East Indian origin or in general as ad@@ j@@ ectively . &quot;
Facebook licensed the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or the sex@@ es ( in Bur@@ m@@ ical let@@ tering ) as part of an initiative to tackle the far spread problem of the Hass@@ language in Burma in the social network .
over the past few years , the asc@@ ension of radical national@@ ist movements has given an extremely dis@@ able K@@ onn@@ ot@@ ation .
in particular , it is a word that mostly used by Ultra national@@ ists as hate Muslims , representing a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to fight them in Myanmar in Myanmar , the company has cen@@ sored a lot of sen@@ sible content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; mag is usually associated with rac@@ ism , but the word is not automatically detected in Hass@@ language .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; lots of people have reported that , in which they have discussed the use of the word or have covered doub@@ ts for the use of the word .
in addition , there are several bur@@ ial words with basic different mean@@ ings that have the same accounting sequence like &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , on Bur@@ m@@ ese also called &apos; Kal@@ ar ht@@ a@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters , as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( coil ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar o@@ at &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ ka@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ ky A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at declared the various mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
a post of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he had asked his friends on a spiritual way whether they could find out how he could lin@@ king his back pain , making a word game .
the sentence K@@ u la - &quot; Healing &quot; ( K@@ u ) + the Fra@@ ct@@ ant ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - similar to the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different .
there were various reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win H@@ d is the opinion that they will reduce the language of radical national@@ ists , but also emphas@@ ized that Facebook would be analytical to spread out all post , who spread in sus@@ pic@@ ion , rac@@ ism .
Facebook del@@ etes the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it automatically filters the word automatically .
the Autom@@ ism will not understand what you are writing on Fac@@ be@@ que .
what to do instead , is the post carefully to analyze and check it by reading the un@@ ev@@ ing words .
for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar Ht@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( Sp@@ ell@@ b@@ sen ) .
the good is that these three @-@ piece national@@ ists who spread hate speech will receive a quite good lesson .
now it is time to circumc@@ ise their national@@ ism .
while the action is able to send a strong signal to all , the hate language may not stop the efficiency of this strategy .
the experiences of social networks in China like S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ chat have demonstrated that the c@@ ensor &apos;s c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship often will start to start a new word or an alternative writing of cen@@ sored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described as Facebook began to clear his post@@ s when he wanted to make his friends only that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was banned from the social network :
... when I was atten@@ tive to this new Directive of Facebook , I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the Word was closed .
Iron@@ ically , my post has been removed from Facebook and me , the li@@ ken , post and parts of content for 24 hours , because the Post has not promised &quot; the Facebook community standards . &quot;
Facebook has a variety of postcards from people , who have no negative inten@@ tions , or those simply try to show their opinions against the Hass@@ am radical national@@ ists .
Patrick Murphy wrote that his mail was removed , who has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech is removed from Facebook .
in the post office , the author shared his opinion why extreme national@@ ism and religious fundament@@ alism are bad in the country .
Chan My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook would have more should do before the start of the initiative , for example , the Bur@@ m@@ ese internet community asked advice :
Facebook may have a well @-@ wanted intention to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma by their platform , but it does not work .
such words are sc@@ anned only more hat@@ red within the different communities .
it seems , as if they have begun to have this without local context or technical support , and so words as &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; Ass@@ um@@ curr@@ y . &quot;
even when they found out that they made mist@@ akes , they didn &apos;t try them to be retri@@ eved .
if they only have more respect for the 15 million benefits , they would like to find a large turnover , that would be great .
fac@@ eb@@ ooks automated c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship has led to users among users .
rather than take it , users can now have fun and write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech to see if their posters will be taken away from the net .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook Post@@ s which were not ab@@ stain@@ ed by Hass@@ language :
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair and watch your bro@@ sen@@ curr@@ y and watch a Indian film .
just to try out whether Facebook contains the post , which contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;

the post states &quot; If you are a doctor , healing then people ? &quot;
screenshot , used with permission .
in the last five years , extreme national@@ ist ide@@ ologies and religious treasure specialists have used social networks to expand their voices and its influence .
among other things , it is intended to heat the violence in the municipalities in Myanmar , especially in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where disp@@ utes between Muslims and Budd@@ hist@@ s have been forced to flee to escape .
Facebook was told for his failure to give them the hated of them on his Bur@@ m@@ ese pages under control , critic@@ ises her .
but instead , rather than to read the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better to concentrate on context than on code concentr@@ ating initiatives and learned of them .
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is concluded with the children &apos;s age .

the to@@ e before is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the country unanimously approved a law which is to offer this practice , so that the married age is now at 18 .
before this change of the Eh@@ eg@@ es@@ etz@@ es held some members of Hin@@ du@@ istic and Muslim religious communities in practice , and in May 2016 , brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mah@@ ar@@ aj , the leader of the various religious groups of the country gathered that the state should not be able to mix , because that , age do not im@@ ply the ri@@ fe . &quot;
this happened a matter of fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago has been a contrac@@ tor to the UN &apos;s Human Rights Convention , the minority which is defined under the age of 18 in the age of 18 .
the UN &apos;s official statistics for the year 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children who have been married to 15 percent in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago was 2.8 percent , and with 18 were 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the Federal Statist@@ ical Office of the country confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys under 19 were married .
online pet@@ itions and social media movements , which ende@@ av@@ ed to abol@@ ish laws to the children &apos;s to@@ e , followed by the base and rejoiced in large support . und@@ ou@@ bt@@ edly helped them to carry out this result .
nevertheless not all of them are smooth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Hin@@ du leader , for example , had no concerns to say the criticism of the children of children , they should say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to worry about their own affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of religious opposition compet@@ ed for st@@ resses in this actually un@@ complicated cause , and sometime in doubt whether the opposition would be at all at all .
but at the beginning of 2017 , the bill was decided against the children of children - despite 4 Sen@@ ators ( including one woman ) of the opposition and an independent , which ab@@ stain@@ ed - so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law .
now , only the President of the country must vote and let the law pro@@ claim .
one of the country &apos;s lowering of the country has been a status update which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle again posted on Inst@@ ag@@ ram :
Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence R@@ amb@@ har@@ at : the bill against children before it was approved in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes against it and no one against them .
after having decided in the Senate , the draft version can now be implemented for the law .
most of the social media users were thr@@ illed because the laws finally had been changed before it &apos;s finally .
Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , which was a minist@@ erial minister in the Ministry of Education , said :
it has too much time and un@@ necessary Ger@@ ede , that has devoured the core of the thing , but do you know what ? the p@@ to@@ e is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago now , and that &apos;s nearly any prize .
while Abel &apos;s Jackson &apos;s opinion it was definitely long enough to abol@@ ish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ al @-@ Thomas was over@@ happy that the day was finally arrived :
public Status Quo update to Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ al@@ - Thomas , which says : , Great Excellent news !
the Eh@@ eg@@ es@@ etz has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for that - 0 against it ! ! ! &quot;
Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , which belongs to Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( W@@ I@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society which said right openly said about how important the adoption of the law noted , noted :
the married age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
the draft version for the Eh@@ eg@@ es@@ etz@@ stein was adopted today , on 9 June 2017 .
in the House of Represent@@ atives there are 41 members and 35 of them were present at the vote .
all members who were added to the Law have approved the law .
the children before is not allowed in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long battle ( ... ) # child@@ judge .
many thanks to all activists who have challenged him .
congratulations to our con@@ gr@@ ats .
a thank you to our M@@ EP@@ s .
but a possible hook comes in the form of Sat Mah@@ ar@@ aj , as Secretary General of the San@@ atan , Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du @-@ Organization of the country .
months ago , Mah@@ ar@@ aj announced his intention to take judicial steps , the law should be passed , and it seems to be able to redeem his promises .
during the At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris Al ra@@ wi , a suppor@@ ter of the law , said it is definitely more right when Mah@@ ar@@ aj wanted to go against the law , the most social media users would like to have the debate about different .
Patri@@ cia Wor@@ rel@@ l beat :
Dear Sat , if we expect to talk the discussion so in general , in a way that we are able to talk to the state into our bedrooms , that they may be able to prevent them from large , hard @-@ ro@@ otten@@ en men who are contrary to the advantage of them , would you be ready to continue the discussion ?
or do you think that it is not a problem ?
however , if it is now to a judicial action against the law , or not , this legislation is an important step - but there is still places in the world where the children are legal or still the norm , although it gives laws to say them .

through the mirrors from websites , Turkish users can watch Wikipedia content again
the English @-@ speaking Wikipedia page was presented in English on January 18 , 2012 , to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IPA copyright laws in the USA , internationally dar@@ kened .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
since over a month , Turkey we@@ aving the popular and the C@@ row@@ d@@ sourcing principle based enc@@ y@@ clo@@ pe@@ dia Wikipedia .
tag tag is clear how important the platform for users can be found to share helpful and share information .
both students as well as repor@@ ter and fans of TV series for@@ bid against the blocking .
although many advanced users @-@ experienced Internet users are used , conversion tools for blocking websites ( a current article from the New York Times report that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world ) , fall by most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey had been forced by Wikipedia since 2008 , like recently published in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University will find regular block of the Internet since 2007 , after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) has been adopted .
after China , Turkey is the second most well @-@ known country of the world when it comes to massive c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of Wikipedia .
while the platform remains closed , there are now several Mir@@ ror@@ sites ( pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and often updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform laid out all Turkish Wikipedia sites on its de@@ centr@@ alized peer @-@ to @-@ peer network , which is not based on the system of domain name , making it difficult to make a complete c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship .
the content is available in spite of the legal prohibition .
in a blo@@ g@@ post IP@@ FS on his efforts :
after we heard the news ( on the blocking of Wikipedia ) we got everything , snap@@ shots of Wikipedia on the IP@@ FS platform . thus , the opportunity to read the content in de@@ centr@@ alized and distributed way .
this can help the users to see at least all Wikipedia content , even if they can &apos;t reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org themselves .
IP@@ FS also gave that this stage is independent of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it only concerns screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to handle the lock .
Crist@@ ian Con@@ sol@@ i of Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ kno@@ ck@@ .org , an open source project that anyone can use the open source project that everyone can ut@@ ili@@ ze similar Mir@@ ror@@ sites when it is locked in the country of Wikipedia .
Con@@ sol@@ i reported sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ rah@@ i - Global Vo@@ ices member as well as staff at Mozilla at Pan@@ ig@@ rah@@ i &apos;s Open Boy &quot; Pod@@ cast :
it is no complete copy from a proxy address , a Mir@@ ror .
you &apos;ll get to another URL , that &apos;s not the original . that what you see is from Wikipedia .
essentially the server heads the server on the right Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia even if they are closed in Turkey .
for this is executed by a server which is not in Turkey .
a curious wild photographer using his camera to make attention to the need for nature conservation

sin@@ king Gir@@ i was with the photos he looked around , never satisfied . they were missing with po@@ or@@ ly positioned moti@@ ves and balanced colors .
the motiv@@ ated it itself a camera to wear and try to gra@@ ze the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
today , at the age of 28 , S@@ essions , Nep@@ als joined the international stage on the international stage .
and its home place right next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , it offers the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that len@@ ken the attention of Nep@@ als as animal world .
he described Facebook as it helps him in his work :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could it give better for a passionate game photographer ! !
I just felt at home when suddenly Navar@@ aj ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had a call from my Father that would be a le@@ op@@ ard on the banks of the Rap@@ ti River .
the river dam is just a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sau@@ rah@@ a .
immediately I ordered my camera with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father watched him , and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the le@@ op@@ le@@ op@@ ard was located and I immediately started to kne@@ e pictures ! !
it is a co @-@ operation with the authorities to obtain worldwide recognition for Nep@@ als Nature and wants to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not so fe@@ ar@@ ful as they look like .
and he ought to know , because he had already seen his tig@@ ers from face to face :
a tiger can &apos;t be inter@@ fer@@ ed from the opinion of the sheep ! !
late evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
also I was because of darkness on the way home , when suddenly the king of the bust appeared . he immediately tells us , and we look forward to seeing me through the sin@@ al @-@ trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , S@@ itting the logo &quot; I click for Conservation ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) to his photos .
however , its passion for the promotion of Nep@@ als Nature and Wild@@ animals is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days , and mostly lived in a tent in order to photograph in Bar@@ dia National Park pictures from Ot@@ tern . up to 12 days it lasted until he could photograph a tiger and live six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist information .

years after the marriage , there were Indian women for the first time to arrange the names of their hus@@ bands .

this post has been written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on Video Vol@@ unte@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organisation from India .
a revised version has been published here as part of a Content @-@ Sh@@ aring Agreement .
in many parts of India there are women with the greatest care , the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
instead they use a p@@ onom@@ en or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
from Ch@@ om@@ is@@ gar@@ h to Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra and Ut@@ t@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h give women to respect to the husband &apos;s social pressure , as well as the fear of consequences , they should retain the norm , these practice live in life .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto from the Indian state of O@@ gli@@ a was sentenced by a head@@ court and to the community of the village , after having talked to a married relations with names .
the tradition does not call their wives to name , is also common among men . however , they have far from less assign@@ ments , if ever , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the P@@ une district of P@@ une , in Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including healthcare professionals , a unique club and thus became fast to the main talks about the city .
it is a place just for them alone , where they discuss the host@@ esses of Patri@@ arch@@ ate and discuss .
as one of 56 clubs , which in 13 Indian countries , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the Community video Vol@@ unte@@ ers and joined the degra@@ dation of Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ine has been working for seven years with the help of their video camera on the discovery of practices , such as children &apos;s marriage to the turn of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and direc@@ ts this clubs .
it reports about how this clubs created a safe place for these women and made them at the same time to the change of the wall .
the first video , the Roh@@ ini pointed in its discussion group , did women who do not call her hus@@ bands at the name .
she decided on this theme because they wanted to start talking about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with whom women can easily identify .
not according to the names of their hus@@ bands , a Br@@ auch , whom they have pleaded not guilty , have never been placed in question .
Roh@@ ini mean :
this tradition bears witness that a woman resp@@ ects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who doesn &apos;t agree , is watched as a woman without Mor@@ al .
the tradition is so deeply ro@@ oted in that we have never made thought of this discussion round .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini wanted to have her husband never before the name to try out at home , as it runs .
she showed the video of discussions round her husband and her mother in law .
Roh@@ ini told :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband still weigh long after the video was at the end .
Pra@@ k@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said that I should call him from now on his name .
Roh@@ ini started her first discussion with this self @-@ confidence in their luggage .
many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women would be protected .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in Ut@@ t@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after video projection , the women tried to bring discussion with a exercise in gear .
Roh@@ ini asked every participant in the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , anno@@ ying , sad , lov@@ ingly , and so on .
then she asked them all , &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us as they want , means they not respect us ?
should it not be equal ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day to whom they brought the name of their hus@@ bands on the lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ine was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra over the breaking of a centuries @-@ old tradition , in which married women to never talk the name of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini told :
one woman was so sh@@ y that during the whole exercise just ahead of themselves ; a others decided to leave the complete fru@@ stration against him and his family , st@@ ating it .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I &apos;ll never forget it again .
still in the ad@@ ren@@ aline , with an ancient Br@@ auch , the women decided that they would actually try to make their hus@@ bands at their name .
and they kept their word .
in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports .
the husband of a wife called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas behind them in the head : his wife could not stop his name to tell his name .
another club member decided to do with dinner before the entire family .
when she had her mother in law , she was afraid , and said that there was an error .
another woman said , &quot; Roh@@ ini said that I should do it . &quot;
a husband &apos;s husband was less understanding and the situation arrived in violence .
Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , like for example , the wearing of the red point on the fore@@ head , which shows the state status :
why do only women have to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband , that I would bear the zin@@ ok point if it also act .
he laugh@@ ed only and I stopped to bear it .
the other women did not hear completely , but mine , they are now able to choose in a better position , even to choose him in some days .
for many women , the discussion group is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals .
&quot; we make a trip at each discussion .
normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field .
I don &apos;t want to make sure the women who could hear what could hear , &quot; says it .
during the last months , they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes for the first time in her life ; they dance and sang and spoke about things about which they had never made thoughts .
raw ini says :
since so many years I have been working on these problems and yet I have been talking about some things , for example how our ident@@ ities are linked to our hus@@ bands , never so hon@@ est .
it feels great to say some things loud , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion group , we have talking about the concept of honour and how it is connected to clothing .
some women in the group have borne only Sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most of it is okay , but some wanted a sal@@ ine c@@ ta , a wide shirt about a tro@@ users ; they don &apos;t have dar@@ nel .
after a lot of stri@@ fe and discussion about the advantages of their own clothes @-@ election , the Mor@@ al is connected to Sar@@ is and much more , Car@@ ug@@ sailed Roh@@ ini their own couple Kur@@ t@@ as ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) in a discussion round , so that women could bear her .
next , they now decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a to which they can carry je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is sure to make it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the question of whether in the five months since their first discussion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; discussion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has changed slightly , Roh@@ ini confirmed that the things are slowly moving into rolls : &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have made only small steps so far .
some women tested it a few times , but then it stopped to say the name of her husband .
some , including me , make it still , but only if they are alone and no other family members .
only one or two will continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women have now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot on their fore@@ head .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes that they want to reach in their lives - like the line for more freedom of movement or the own clothes @-@ election - at the end of a difficult to navigate the river .
looking forward to self @-@ confidence , it is aware of them that they are sitting in the same boat .
how raw ini explains :
each of us is a sacrifice of Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am it too .
but this club gives everyone of us the confidence that something is going to change .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction if any woman is talking about home and other people , what we speak and what we do .
we all sit in the same boat .

a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which was probably made recently .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published under a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of in@@ car@@ cer@@ ated Chinese dis@@ sidents Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has moved attention to the international community since his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he was hospit@@ alized due to liver cancer in the final stage of cancer .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( citizenship ) , after he was involved in the draft Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o that calls for the democratic re@@ forms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China has referred to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a internal matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a speaker tells of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this thing with some other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless China continues to earn calls from the international community , Nobel Peace Prize and his wife , Di@@ chter@@ in Li@@ u X@@ ia , who allow to allow for a treatment abroad .
while some countries critic@@ ized the strict treatment of the Pa@@ ares in Beijing , others are completely eradi@@ cated on the topic .
Hong Kong Free Press has collected some reactions from abroad .
United Nations
Z@@ eid R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , Commissioner of the United Nations for Human Rights , met at the end of June of Chinese civil servants to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
however , a speaker refused to comment whether the United Nations must ex@@ ert pressure to allow h@@ ay to make a treatment abroad .
Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ø@@ r@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
the relationship between China and Norway has been transferred to the store after the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 has been awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian government said they have nothing to do with decision .
diplomatic relations continued until December last year . only in June , Norway signed an agreement to re@@ locate the salmon to China , since exports have been largely blocked since 2010 .
after that the message was spreading that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee introduced its hope on an un@@ conditional release of release and invited Li@@ u to pick his prize in Oslo .
due to his arrest , he was not able to accept his prize .
during the ceremony , Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on July 6 , the European Parliament adopted a decision on which China was asked to liber@@ ate Li@@ u and his wife immediately from house arrest and to allow him to seek medical support , where he wants .
the leading diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , in China also called for release Li@@ us , as they did in a declaration on June 30 :
at the same time , we expect all restrictions of Mr. Li@@ us &apos;s wife and family members .
you should meet all the visits and receive they wish they wish to communicate and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
USA
U.S. ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad distributed that Americans would wish him that he has the opportunity for the treatment abroad unless it is in help with his help . &quot;
an spokes@@ person for the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AF@@ P on June 27 that the message refused to release the Chinese authorities , not only to release Li@@ u , but also his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from her house arrest .
the opinion of US Embassy moved with a certain response from China after itself , with the exterior of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that &quot; no Land has the right to be unique and un@@ related comments on Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley shared that China should offer the following :
protection and freedom , such as travel intelligence , and access to the medical care of his election , which they are entitled to the Chinese constitution and legal system as well as the international obligations .
the US Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz are also introduced a decision in the Congress to un@@ cover the Chinese government to un@@ cover Li@@ u and his wife un@@ conditi@@ onally .
I needed China to allow the Nobel Prize @-@ winner # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , allowing it to be in proper medical treatment . ht@@ t@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany
on July 3 , Berlin , the German government spokes@@ person Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote that Li@@ u &quot; receives all the medical support that he needs &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot;
the Chinese President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping was issued on 7 and 8 July at the G20 summit in Hamburg .
previously , diplomatic sources reported in Peking of the News Agency Reuters , that China had great concerns whether the vor@@ tex could over@@ lay the visit to Hamburg .
Canada
on June 28 , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um asked China to provide a reasonable medical care and to give it the possibility of being able to leave his family .
Li@@ us lawyer told AF@@ P earlier that Li@@ us Mr@@ s Li@@ u X@@ ia , who could visit him every day , but the police always monitored the room in the hospital and that it is not permitted to talk with someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact .
Mc@@ Call@@ um tells us :
Canada calls on China to safegu@@ ard its international human rights on human rights , including freedom of expression , to preserve the exercise of these rights .
France
in a declaration on June 29 , France , France , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs asked for humanitarian reasons :
all necessary measures must be taken in order to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o gets all treatments which he needs . furthermore , his wife and family should have contact with him .
although the news coverage had already reported that French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , announced that no further information may be out whether France would be able to end it .
Taiwan
the Council of the commemorative event in Taiwan called for China on June 27 on , to release Li@@ u and require a greater tolerance towards those who want peaceful resources to demand political re@@ forms and democratic development .
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ature Yu Me@@ i @-@ n@@ u demanded from the ruling Democratic Pro@@ gress Party in China to allow the sick of intellectual Li@@ u to treat themselves in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leaders in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed himself very careful in a declaration on 28 June by Li@@ u and gave him that many asked him to pray for Li@@ us .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my faith that he took the initiatives that he had taken and had contributed to a harmon@@ ious , more stable and we@@ al@@ thy China , which would have contributed to a more peaceful world .
I felt personally and encouraged me when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tu@@ als and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the charter of 08 , which stands for democracy , freedom and legal rule in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .

Singapore is a city or a country ?
the question is sil@@ ly appear as Singapore has been recognized as an independent state since Singapore .
but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am should be viewed as a city in Singapore .
this re@@ mark triggered a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting of a meeting of the international branches of the State of New York , the Minister noted that many people were the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore as compared to Singapore with other countries .
he under@@ stands that Singapore should be considered a city .
... no one has questi@@ oned whether New York is a democracy ...
that &apos;s it , most people go an error .
I have tried to explain that we are otherwise .
we are a city .
we are no country .
the blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io accused the Minister of Justice to spin the logic in order to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore .
and then , after all our efforts and offerings , this valuable land is to be created , we hear that we finally have no country .
it was so vul@@ gar , it had the licence of a flight before the responsibilities , a mandatory infr@@ in@@ gement .
Singapore , if thou art not my country whose land is it ?
the reasons mentioned by Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am were not very pleased : he def@@ ended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of its , he appeared in@@ sof@@ tened .
on the other hand , he def@@ ended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally the cities that are permanently led by a party .
these cities are democr@@ atically .
once you reach the core point of the theme , once again the good old glue of the author@@ itarian fe@@ as@@ ers return to be demo@@ c@@ rat@@ ory logic , leaving the twi@@ sted logic , because they fit better to their power .
in the final outcome , the responses were given by Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am on the last week of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am answers to his American guests in our press , our J@@ udi@@ k@@ ative , our political system really non @-@ answers .
related questions tar@@ .g@@ z with non @-@ answers .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls for Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , his opinion , since they have not understood this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country but a city , so to which country owns our city ...
shortly , I understand nothing .
I would be very than@@ k@@ ful if our wer@@ der K Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am would take on the effort to clari@@ fy this point if he was high paid to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
based on the blog his comment , he shows referring to the reviews that you should start to read the whole address of the conference , so that you could understand the context of the statements by Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am better , according to which Singapore has a city and no country .
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore has more a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stated why the elections in Singapore will be so un@@ willing , even if we are looking forward to free and just elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he disp@@ ers@@ ed Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said , Singapore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be not a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he obviously didn &apos;t tell it in that sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment over Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , who makes the leader of a her@@ al@@ growing generation , making such a pol@@ em@@ ic statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore has said , &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Gar@@ de that I expected to agree with them or not , but this is another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , member of the new generation of the political leader of Singapore , I have doubt and I &apos;m not even sure whether he really believes , really associated and aware of what he def@@ ended .
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review summar@@ izes the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am arguments :
did Mr. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am committed an error . &quot; did Mr. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am committed an error , or was it a friend driver ?
if Singapore is not a country , we are only regarded as an independent and sover@@ eign state ?
if not , what country is the sover@@ eign rights of the city of Singapore ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally country and city .
since he plays an important role within the government office , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am are of serious importance .
why do the people help their military service , but they only defend their city ?
who must pay our Prime Minister ?
what is the value of our pink staff ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
but the Journey Journey of a Dec@@ ade to the mean age , Singapore is always a city :
&quot; I did not say what I said ... &quot;
this pack seems to have many people more expensive ...
no one has ever told that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we were always a town / island state .
I can understand that we often hear statements such as &quot; the defense of the country mainly &quot; etc . , but this is not quite true .
we were to speak from the defense of the city .

global Vo@@ ices asked His Ed@@ itors : what is the most mis@@ er@@ able aspect of your home or home country ?
your answers are published here as part of a continuous series , with the rum@@ ours that should be revealed and another fac@@ et should be shown .
the newest part of this series is from Nev@@ to Thom@@ pson , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
the question that is placed in Japan on most , is : &quot; are you American ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1994 I live and again in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on the situation in which the situation takes place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in his conversation partners by taking personal questions .
in my clari@@ fication then the standard response follows : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice @-@ hockey , nature . &quot; many c@@ ops are perhaps un@@ fortun@@ ate before rage , but if they are kept for Americans , but do not distur@@ b me .
for som@@ eb@@ ody who doesn &apos;t know , there are little who distingu@@ ishes ourselves from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why the Canadian flag bring a Canadian flag well visible on their back@@ pack when travelling .
all love Canadian .
Americans , however ... .
so it was , when I started travelling around the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Canadian have always applied little bul@@ ls of their baggage to distingu@@ ish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care !
there is no weapons with us !
the same sex@@ es have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
all seem to think , Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
we obviously say very often &quot; exc@@ use . &quot;
Canada is also supposed to be the toler@@ ant country opposite ethnic groups .
we are not as such as those types south of the border .
we are Canadian .
I hate it .
first , I have many American friends who I ad@@ mi@@ red a lot .
it would not make me nothing , if one would change to Johnny in Dallas by example .
with Marc out of Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
first : to be called &quot; nice &quot; to be di@@ ligent to be di@@ lig@@ ently - as the hau@@ gh@@ ty , gentle , but trag@@ ically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flanders of &quot; The Sim@@ p@@ sons &quot; ( one of their own Canadian double ) .
if Canada is really a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flanders , this would be a step forward . but the real problem exists in that &quot; nice &quot; does not have any personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing at which one can stum@@ ble .
harm@@ less , is in@@ con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous and un@@ interesting to earn no attention .
this may be something good if you want to remain un@@ noticed in the background , from the things that happen around a round .
I would even go to say that the wish to be free and only to be one of the Canadian citizenship .
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
what can be viewed as &quot; nice &quot; but is maybe just cool polit@@ eness .
Canadian don &apos;t talk about the fence with the neigh@@ bors .
we l@@ acks a warm welcome , open kindness , which I now connect to my American friends .
than@@ k@@ ful for us ( and for the rest of the world ) then Just@@ in Tru@@ de@@ au took the stage to show that Canadian has made more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has almost made of sexy .
music video of a Pop @-@ Band par@@ odi@@ zed Thailand in Thailand
one in Thailand famous Pop @-@ Band has published a music video , which the Jun@@ ta par@@ odi@@ ert , who took power in 2014 and restore power in 2014 , still ruled the country .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man , who told him that rules his friend .
although it is not explicitly polit@@ ically , music video refers to the continued military su@@ prem@@ acy of the Jun@@ ta .
the band was blessed by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video to song was a huge success .
within the first three days , the video was shared on Facebook 1,@@ 254 times and received 8.@@ 800 li@@ kes .
last month , the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The dict@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists compl@@ ained to see this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and enter@@ taining introduction to the Thai policy , in@@ breeding such as it holds the situation in the country under the Jun@@ ta rule .

the post @-@ war company re@@ covers very slowly in East Asia Minor , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
it is now over 20 years have passed since the Geor@@ gian @-@ ab@@ as@@ ian war officially ended , but his fol@@ ks are still visible in this part of the republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show distinctive pictures .
villages such as D@@ zh@@ an@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in the carbon pool of Ab@@ ch@@ Asia .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , de@@ stru@@ sts , Geor@@ gi@@ er and Armen@@ ians lived and worked in the area in the area .
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
today they live to the biggest part Russians and ch@@ ases in the area .
such settlements are also called Spiritual ma@@ ids in Ab@@ ch@@ Asia .
in the pre @-@ war period , there were even more than 10,000 people , today there are only a few hundred people in those spirits .
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 the total population of the District took over 16,000 people , after being hardly ever increased over a decade .
in 1989 about 43@@ ,000 people lived in this municipality .

&quot; all is a result of the war &quot;
the empty five @-@ storey blocks of the Soviet Union from the early &apos; 60s , who are called Ch@@ ru@@ sch@@ t@@ ch@@ uk , are symbolic for the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are fallen and rarely , they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ zh@@ an@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native older man .
he begins a conversation and it &apos;s hard to stop this .
&quot; all is a consequence of the war . &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; why ?
nevertheless it is clear . &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
there were municipal centres , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens , who served all of the community .
now there are only paved road with ver@@ b@@ rist@@ les spl@@ end@@ our buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and to their contribution to the central planning industry of the Soviet Union , have meanwhile left the bor@@ ough .
in the gh@@ ost town of D@@ zh@@ an@@ tu@@ k@@ ha live about fifty inhabitants .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other towns it looks similar .
the ch@@ ru@@ ch@@ av@@ ow@@ es , which is still one or two families , are recogni@@ z@@ able to the balconies where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when you discover me with the camera in the hand , they go back immediately .
&quot; our mother has forbidden us to photograph , &quot; says one of the girls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she simply banned us , that is all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ per@@ ed to her friend and suddenly qu@@ it the destroyed buildings and van@@ ish .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining companies called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al@@ ug@@ ol .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence industry ( cultivation of domestic products ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable construction .
it is difficult to come about the laps .
in winter , the District Administration provides for free candles and bread to the ham@@ lets .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ cchini &quot;
about ten years ago , an older woman moved with the name Gal@@ ina ( or a@@ unt G@@ um , as it is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to the jung@@ a .
despite her el@@ dest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina has not left before Ab@@ ch@@ Asia to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever &quot; in Ab@@ ch@@ Asia . &quot;
Gal@@ ina wants to accept a financial help by her daughter and wait for their young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly r@@ ents are just 9 dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman and a young family and I live in this building .
if we are , please visit us .
but we cannot do this , everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot;
while she tells her story , a recent neigh@@ bor appears on the balcony .
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; calling T@@ ante G@@ alya her . &quot; they said , we could build cour@@ get@@ tes .
I already prepared the floor .
I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ cchini . &quot;
&quot; one can get to everything &quot;
in her house , G@@ aly@@ as talks with her husband and the five common children lived in their house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day they re@@ members to the village in front of the war .
despite the relatives , who live in Central Russia , Oss@@ et@@ ia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ ch@@ ar broke away ) , they didn &apos;t leave the opportunity to leave it .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but this will still be something &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ ascha is receiving about $ 9 children &apos;s money for every child .
her husband works in the Kohl@@ eng@@ ru@@ be .
the young family has its own farm .
in the vicinity of the house where Nat@@ asch@@ as nurs@@ ery was once located , they keep pigs , cows , h@@ ack@@ ne and chick@@ ens .
it is told that it was initially a very anxi@@ ous situation when many people left the village after the war .
but in the course of time it lost its fears .

&quot; we have no fear of dark street or the few people .
it can be used to get everything .
many people believe that this building was destroyed during the war .
in fact , it has something to do with pill@@ age .
after the war , there were hardly work and all lived as it was right .
I remember every day how the city and the war were once . &quot;
when our conversation is turned to the end , a small boy passed away to us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hidden .
a ball flies from the window and another boy from pursu@@ ing him .
he plays with the ball that rolls out the hill .
a group children now pursu@@ ing the ball .
while they run , some of them throw stones to the ru@@ ined buildings .
these ruins are a part of their childhood which car@@ es for in@@ justice in their lives .
they do not know any other .

in Mexico &quot; m@@ om Africa &quot; houses migrants on her long voyage
Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez is a small hotel in tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , near the border of Mexico .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our partner PR@@ I.@@ org and will be published here with friendly permission .
on the road to migrants who cross Europe or Latin America , some places for their hospitality will be known .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he is located at the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is led by a 59@@ - year old Mexican artist , a little woman with a cor@@ als of cor@@ dial and gold be@@ zel in t@@ ed@@ dy bear in t@@ ed@@ dy bear .
she is called Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name of Mama Africa .
this peak sur@@ name is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it has become a goal of Afri@@ cans and Ha@@ iti@@ ans , who are on the passage .
the hotel has no charm .
for about $ 2,50 the night the guests sleep in simple rooms , with grinding , cr@@ um@@ bled walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless there are hundreds of African and Ha@@ iti@@ an migrants here .
sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells you the people in a few small buses and from the upper part of the coast they start to call : &quot; m@@ om Africa !
where are you m@@ um Africa ? . &quot;
currently there is rather quiet but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have already slept outside on boxes .
she wants to re@@ ject no one .
she also helps them and bring them to the hospital if they are sick , she buys them medic@@ ations that they could not pay them , they mass@@ aged them with a bal@@ m that they st@@ ole away from long voyage .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebast@@ i@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived in front of a short time .
I asked him if Mama Africa is a reasonable first name for Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the Sebast@@ i@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a jo@@ ys ) pos@@ ing with Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel that it fits to her because African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very lov@@ ingly lov@@ ingly .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very well here . &quot;
Sebast@@ i@@ ao travels with his sister , who hopes to get to Boston where her husband and the three children return .
they have already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States , normally a first stop in South America and then go towards the north .
the family had owned by other way@@ far@@ ers of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the route , &quot; Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti .
he tells that Ha@@ iti@@ ans and the Afri@@ cans often travel together the route and that the Afri@@ cans are talking about W@@ hat@@ s@@ App of Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
how many of his Weg@@ ner leaders lived Michel@@ et previously in Brazil and worked as a construction worker at the construction sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he started his journey into the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : it sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him whether he is in contact with Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let go back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was sm@@ iling and we will always stay in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells us that their guests have to send their often text messages when they are going to gr@@ ate them or to report on the course of their journey .
it explains that their Christian faith is the drive of their work .
they don &apos;t know much about Africa , but their guests have taught you to prepare chicken as in Ghana .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but it is not the only spar@@ king hope for migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the town a S@@ ack@@ g@@ asse leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
in this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have enrolled migrants in their little house .
it is polic@@ eman and has found that the Bust@@ ets are sold too expensive on numerous African migrants .
he began to help them to get a reasonable price , then he has offered them his house for one dollar the night .
at the moment , there are 25 people , mainly Ha@@ iti@@ ans .
some sleep in ceilings on the ground , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking site outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests do .
&quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; says he . &quot; I experienced what they experienced .
I have crossed the border over the desert and we have suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s the reason why I give them my support . &quot;
after having lived for three years , he was exp@@ elled after a raid on his work place from the United States after a raid .
the majority of migrants who travels through Tap@@ ach@@ ula , comes from Central America , other residents open the doors of their houses to them .
José Antonio C@@ ord@@ ova Mel@@ én@@ dez tells me that he has fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children prior to people who wanted to comp@@ ress money of him without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown , a single bearing , has offered him a roof .
a few months later the family lives and tried to decide where the next steps should go .
back to the house of Mama Africa is all again full of guests .
in the gears consult the travelers of quiet their phones .
a mini@@ bus has arrived today and has 20 new guests , a large majority of Somalia .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy about that her house is full but she is also nost@@ al@@ g@@ isch , because of those who have gone away .
like a proud grand@@ mother they sh@@ atter@@ ed them in their album with numerous photos .
there are one of her daughter with African hair care that you made a Kund@@ in , some photos of their grand@@ children and many travelers more , kids and elderly .
she laugh@@ ed , while she briefly presents her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ya se &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; repeated every time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you &apos;re already gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang inhabitants are forced to install a monitoring app on their mobile phones .
a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang from Twitter @-@ User .
the residents of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic min@@ orities region in West China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones .
on 10 July , the mobile users in the Ti@@ an@@ shan district of the town of Ur@@ um@@ qi was assigned a phone notification , which it features a monitoring app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web cleaning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the message it is said that the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be able to obtain access to terrorist information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the authorities must use the app for more than the fight against terrorism .
according to a exclusive report of Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h was arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ fecture , because she had installed the app shortly after they had replaced the app .
in the communication of the police , the app determine the sources and the distribution paths of the terror@@ ists and follow , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , pictures , e@@ books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ w@@ angs website describes the App as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service provider with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elecom .
the main function is the blocking of por@@ no@@ graphic websites , by online sc@@ am , Tro@@ ians and Ph@@ ishing pages to make users brow@@ sing this way , how much time they spend online in order to remote control the home network .
this app features the filters for min@@ ors to help children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these features can be used in a varied way .
for example , the remote control &apos; remote actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers can manipul@@ ate the home network of a person or steal it .
this introduction will be in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
while the messages about digital c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in China are mostly concentrated on the experience of users in major cities in the East and the South , reality is very often dark for those who live in remote , ur@@ ged ethnic minority regions like X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in conflict areas , authorities often arrange extreme c@@ ens@@ ors and monitoring measures , as well as rout@@ in@@ ely internet de@@ pl@@ ements .
based on Twitter @-@ based media out@@ let &quot; Images from the Republic of China &quot; ( Munich ) , the scen@@ ic news in China was published , displayed photos from a Check@@ point where polic@@ emen trained in@@ discri@@ min@@ ately , whether they had installed the monitoring app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian ensure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification demanded that people install the app within 10 days .
if you are detected at a Check@@ point using a device without these software , they could be imprisoned up to 10 days .
this is a blow for technological development .
they are forced to use devices that are intended for older people .
this is a form of captivity through future growth technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from the cities of China &quot; ( located in the sex@@ es turn ) , also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description from which the software can lift the password requirement of a Windows operating system and thus obtain un@@ restricted access to the computer &apos;s hard drive .
after the installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and cell@@ phones are in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang to electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the regulations in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang are possibly a reaction to the instructions of the party council to minim@@ ize the dis@@ sem@@ ination of illegal content .
all government departments , authorities and party associations , including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office during operation of their computer and communication devices .
a current report from Freedom House , a US @-@ American Human Rights organization , also mentioned these new surveillance methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang published the authorities on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi a regulation with orders on all residents and entrepren@@ eurs , to register their &quot; personal ID cards , cell phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ eb@@ ooks , and media memory cards &quot; at the local police .
the intention is obvious to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos . &quot; this action is viol@@ ated the personality rights of ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole range of other possible prices , including those who relate to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or death , Part 1 : everything cri@@ es after death
one single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

this is the first of six reports in series &quot; sleep or death , &quot; in which the activity is Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane put his experiences in a Syrian prison .
far away from our blue , virtual world you look at and adjust@@ s that you are all alone at one place in which all the most important is gone .
everything has shifted to and after dis@@ band@@ ed and dis@@ band@@ ed a truth that is clearly recogni@@ z@@ able , both from inside and outside .
one who makes her name all honour .
one who feel in a list of feelings and squ@@ ee@@ zing down , that allow no met@@ aph@@ ors .
but when you beat the reality and look behind the scenes - beyond the acting , the beautiful scenes and the performer - transform the characters into beings from flesh and blood , and everything cri@@ es after death .
any doubt be in smoke , and you will aware of your existence , even if the earth turns on the axis of the una . it is clear that you are caught between the walls , your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone around stone .
they have taken me and my father three times , but that was not enough to learn &quot; my lesson , &quot; as the boss of the security service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he introduced his power on us , having even destroyed the sim@@ pl@@ est concepts we knew .
five young people were torn down during a peaceful protests like dar@@ nel from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
it was enough to break the darkness of the night with &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; -@@ Schrei@@ es .
all the quarters were cov@@ eted , only my own .
for the first time it was quiet , reg@@ ained , for false time , even if I had no high demands to a city that is to be transferred to the ar@@ tery with state security organisms and their compli@@ ments .
in the third night the things had to be soo@@ thing after the power supply was stopped in the quarter .
I broke the silence by crying several times &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house roof out of my house .
I heard my voice through the silence .
a few minutes later , some of my friends felt good enough to gather together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends came to me ; we banned us to a magnificent image that filled my expectations and fulfilled all .
in such a moment you will tell you that you saved the Spirit from the lamp but are just interested in the od@@ ing@@ est .
I received a call from my father : &quot; we are ready to meet us at the military security building . &quot;
he set up .
then I met the following : no matter how much honey you can hin@@ ge - nothing can return to you all the way until the office of the security service from the body .
I joined there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there as I was now .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an starts to say : &quot; let me hear , even as you are called &apos; All@@ ahu &apos;s &apos; , or you are only cour@@ age@@ ous enough to cry when we are not near . &quot;
his h@@ ash filled eyes set on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you really g@@ rief to look to me in the eyes , and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did , did nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood before this building .
perhaps it was on my foolishness , E@@ it@@ el@@ iness ; perhaps in the Revolution .
I was so sure when I answered , &quot; I didn &apos;t think that you &apos;ve had forgotten my voice since yesterday .
and I think I never heard you to look into the eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t do any word from what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is bound him in sing@@ ly and his father with this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; his father would like to do with it . &quot;
the st@@ ank of this curse is between me and today in the nose .
he became a &quot; syndrome , &quot; a se@@ p@@ ic torture that I was exposed to months .
I scre@@ ams the farm .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with me .
then again by the farm and into the second office , which leads through a gang to the individual cells .
I liked all details exactly before I cared for the room .
otherwise it would be assigned a larger cell for me this time .
I have to share them with only one another prisoner , and may immediately place me without waiting for their permission .
after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the civil servants left the cell , and I put back on a well @-@ proven communication method : with the f@@ ist against the wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my c@@ rank@@ ings was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ mit@@ ig@@ ling &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long tax collectors he said to me .
apparently in none of the surrounding cells , a respected young age , which looks similar to me and is called the doctor &quot; doctor .
in the perfect darkness , there are no distinctive fac@@ tions in me , and doctors do not exist here ; we are all only numbers .
&quot; maybe som@@ eb@@ ody , whose voice is similar to my sounds ? &quot;
all answers to His existence .
in perhaps he was transferred to one of the major cells .
perhaps he will stop immediately .
the investig@@ ator had as@@ sures me that they would be free when I tar@@ ry .
li@@ ar .
I would like to have had a bird &apos;s h@@ ay to drive all these c@@ rows who lab@@ elled on the fruit in the garden of my head .
from the distance I hear them still &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar . &quot;
it must be at least 10 clock in the evening , always around those time , the cri@@ es , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black the color of the ver@@ ware , until I saw the yellow light , which revealed us the tomb in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; Donn@@ er , &quot; playing on 13th position of the Kor@@ an ) .
&quot; you are here to hear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was the secret to protect the state of government before us and prevent the betra@@ yers and the terror@@ ists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wit@@ ty dial@@ ect - thus they played their con@@ cave rule and made the close eye view of their world view .
this is not a house here , which is not a country ; it is a curse to call it Ko@@ exist@@ ent to transform the crimin@@ als of their sound in a hero .
I cared for the listening space and meet in Abu I@@ mad , a slim and sto@@ cky man ; at least he comes before me .
it starts a &quot; pleasant &quot; con@@ vers@@ ation , in spite of the fac@@ ial expres@@ sions , which you are young , you &apos;re still young , you can di@@ gest a lot of Wi@@ ch@@ ti@@ ger@@ es with your life when you &apos;re going to protest against this day and to protest at demonstrations that will soon become an end . &quot;
I did not answer .
I have acc@@ ust@@ omed to answer it , not to answer .
I really cannot say anything to say when Bel@@ ei@@ vers and stro@@ kes after a friendly conversation for me had become more common communication .
when and how that happened , was un@@ important .
some voice in me told me that I had to be punished or fail@@ ing to be punished , even though I had done nothing to earn this sentence .
an penalty in all of its diversity .
his command is to rip so much meat as possible from the body .
it is called the lov@@ ingly &quot; conf@@ ession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe which probably comes out of the clo@@ aca .
your Hen@@ ker gave up to your cry .
give it the pleasure that you can &apos;t measure you with him and you can &apos;t keep your cry .
my cry was not enough for him , so they caught the pipe through a cable .
in my first arrest , I asked if the investig@@ ator had been working earlier times as a refuse or whether that belonged to normal work equipment .
they had four cables in each other to present us , from their point of view , great invention of a giant cable .
in one hour changes three of them sel@@ dom appeared , while still on the series .
I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice , why I list@@ ened to sh@@ out .
the Hen@@ ker noted the cooling down and had no pleasure in mind , which is why it was next to an electrically charged rod .
electricity through all the body , enough to feed my whole quarter .
my semi @-@ bare body , which was stretched out on the ground , was the perfect power conductor .
the di@@ ver disappeared and the pain was back .
after two horri@@ ble hours , he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
this must have been so at midnight .
I decided to sleep back on me ; let &apos;s say that it was my only option .
some hours passed , which came to me as minutes .
then the call to the dawn .
the door opens and the morning light meets the room &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fic@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am answering with the voice of an exhau@@ sted young people : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my lord , my father must be fe@@ ar@@ ful wor@@ ries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; be quiet , and away you , you will be moved . &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they released me .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian Rap@@ per Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b talks about the rights of L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q + community , free expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b brings the majority of its time in the room ; times he m@@ ashed to his screen , once in his computer , and again to his couch .
when you can leave , there is a cigarette among his fingers or to discover the lips of nic@@ ot@@ in mac@@ ulate lips .
he lives in the top of his family house which had been part of them since 1967 ; the year where Israel had completed its occupation of the West Bank and the H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs family had been forced to flee from its village in Palestine , where they had lived as fel@@ i@@ ye@@ en ( about : farmer ) .
for six years H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is a passionate activity that the conservative majority was transferred to gender equality and their old proven opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and free expression of opinion by art and ra@@ ve .
with his music , often out with topics such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , rac@@ ism , and the situation of Palestinian ge@@ vol@@ at@@ ts , he also demands the nu@@ cle@@ us of the entire Arab world . all these topics do not only find out in its hom@@ etown of America , but also in cities that are enough by Damascus in Syria as far as to San@@ aa in Yemen .
with his 25 years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees itself in its thinking not restricted by borders , and it is able to suffer according to their own statement with people who have among the devastating consequences of foreign inter@@ ventions in countries like Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even though he is not open to off@@ end , he is a special b@@ aff@@ ection to U.S. foreign policy .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b doesn &apos;t believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war areas where he was born , even if he was born in Jordan himself , even if he was born in Jordan and never before Palestine .
&quot; I don &apos;t think of my own life ! &quot; emphas@@ ises H@@ d@@ ai@@ b .
then he adds : &quot; I think so , because I am a man , &quot; during he dissolved the nest of Ram@@ ad@@ an in two cups . it is the holy month Ram@@ ad@@ an ; in this period it is planned for Muslims at sunrise until sun@@ down .
the law also says that the public consumption of food is illegal during Ram@@ ad@@ an .
apparently , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weak@@ nesses to break with ancient traditions . on the other hand , a cup of coffee has a sen@@ su@@ al hot Jun@@ it@@ ag little with protest against Islam .
basically , the battles are pure coffee and the sc@@ iss@@ ors of the C@@ ent @-@ cigarette in the nose in the nose in the first line of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the free sky , especially if one th@@ rows a look into the neighbouring countries .
of which , it avo@@ ids easy to do basic things - as to the public during Ram@@ ad@@ an water - to do not in prison .
recently , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has cancelled a performance of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a , had to be cancelled for the second time .
some parliamentary elections that support the Islam@@ ist branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argu@@ ed that sexual orientation of the hom@@ osexual fron@@ ti@@ ers Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , contra@@ di@@ ct the cultural and traditional nor@@ ms of the country , talks and the main reason for the concert table .
the members of the Islamic Coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert &quot; just had to be cancelled due to sexual orientation of the owner .
many claim to be the commitment of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , Human Rights and free expression of opinion in the Arab world be more dangerous acti@@ vis@@ m , which represents the old proven legitim@@ acy regime in the entire region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a endor@@ sed the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights &quot; to continue to use &quot; for intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement would be probably not easy to reach Rh@@ et@@ or@@ k , but actually a clear crystal @-@ cryst@@ alli@@ zed reality in Jordan was clearly reflected in H@@ d@@ ai@@ b &apos;s plant .
in 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b traditional gender nor@@ ms into the body , having formed his vision of the fate of arab@@ ic women , which have vo@@ iced sex .
the picture shows the sk@@ el@@ eton of a apparently spot@@ ted woman , whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by hands of those who actually should trust .
in the past few years the number of Hon@@ or &apos;s number has increased in Jordan - the in@@ official exter@@ n@@ ally .
human Rights Watch , according to the number of Hon@@ or of Hon@@ or in 2016 , reached its zen@@ ith ; however , the number of institutional infrastructure is missing in order to support the women who tried to support murder or domestic violence at an appropriate manner .
according to a law from 1954 , women may be exposed to the risk of un@@ familiar violence , &quot; at un@@ certain time in prison , &quot; and for their release is often a lon@@ ely bureau@@ cr@@ atic effort as well as the guarantee on family , that the woman will not happen nothing .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs Music is also pleased with great popularity and is well known to rep@@ lic@@ ate the topics in his country long as tab@@ oo .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b contest that his work is polit@@ ically , but is that he is his music , which is full of exp@@ on@@ ations on sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression of expression , cannot be separated from politics .
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I became a policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b takes the question of the Palestinian identity in attack .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb , &quot; the focus will be on poverty .
the list of songs that are polit@@ ically active in the core can be continued .
in March 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b released a song titled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a scripture is repeated :
&quot; you are free and everyone else is it . &quot;
in the course of the song , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a kind of market , on which one can get in his words , &quot; what you want &quot; - whether faith or non @-@ believ@@ ing , h@@ etero@@ gen@@ ic or homosexu@@ ality .
it not@@ ices that hardly anyone stated in Jordan on the rights of g@@ ay and les@@ bi@@ ans , and comments on equality between L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q + individuals will be cen@@ sored in 2014 .
in 2014 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b led an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ an On@@ line@@ Program Ro@@ ya , in order to re@@ mark that his comments were torn out of the context and had been cen@@ sored in his opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Youtube it was up@@ loaded without cuts , but only one worked version , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says he . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b advert@@ ises the Arabic L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that Int@@ ol@@ er@@ ance opposed to Islam did not talk to Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the eighth century , which still remains in memory thanks to its hom@@ o@@ erotic poems .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks : if Abu Nu@@ what , who should work later on behalf of the Cali@@ ph , could write in the eighth century open over homosexu@@ ality , why can &apos;t they do this ?
the real problem , such as H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a or the fact that the concert had to be cancelled .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ian kingdom there is nothing new that the government attacks on the free expression of opinion and that progressive voices will be brought to silence .
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian newspaper acquired several former government members and members of the teacher &apos;s association with the grounds of critic@@ izing themselves on comments in social media to the problems associated with the deeply ro@@ oted in the country .
in view of what is the H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs concert , only the tip of the ice@@ berg - the real challenge is to work a structural change in the next generation of the Jordan .
progress for him is progress , and take refuge . Jordan has denied a performance , but the progress of progress - so it looks like H@@ d@@ ai@@ b - consists of slow , print and in@@ hosp@@ itable changes . it is sure that these changes take place every day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
finally , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b dreams , like millions of other Arab@@ s too , from an Arab world without inter@@ ventions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he dre@@ aming , not only of them to bring his work to Bagh@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the region is att@@ ain@@ able with the help of music , art and literature of a real and basic gra@@ vi@@ ity - and not through bombs , stre@@ w@@ itions and on artificial kind , democracy . at least , he hopes it .
until far as far as far , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is further expansion and consequently also the resistance .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan .
these great , ex@@ trav@@ ag@@ ant soldiers are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous the@@ ories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festivals .
it is thought that there is a variation of Tan@@ ab@@ ata Festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of the T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us , and from one time come , in the armed forces from west Japan to the nor@@ theastern mar@@ sch@@ ated to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the Em@@ ishi to force the knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to gra@@ b a few great places , therefore we have a great view .
you can only imagine how big these parts are ...
a joint center in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition to W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( lit@@ t@@ l ) .
I &apos;ve been looking forward to the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en again for a long time : two carav@@ ans are just visible .
nevertheless , for many people who take the journey to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival will take the only tru@@ th@@ - and in this way to spend his summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer Festival in the North of the country .
I was there , and I watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 metres hei@@ gh@@ ted car was incredible .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !

rarely , outer appearance and body care is as important as in this history , because they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth from crimin@@ ality and to promote a legitim@@ ate profession as follows the Fr@@ yer .
El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us most important port , located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , close to the historic centre of Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where street smoking and illegal drug tra@@ des are daily .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region are not safe .
at the same time , Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - a rising demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , the appearance and therefore the unusual hair@@ style of famous athletes , such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Peru ) , led to Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or Ne@@ ym@@ ar ( Brazil ) , has led to give yourself more normal citizens into the experienced hands of hair@@ style , who can create these un@@ pleasant hair@@ dresser .
unprecedented demand for hair@@ style , which go to the outw@@ ard bound@@ aries of imagination and creativity , even an annual event inspired by the contest of hair@@ dresser &apos;s &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os &quot; competition , which has been running since 2014 .
there are experts in each other to show how to create the ec@@ cent@@ ric lungs as you can see in the following video ( other videos for current cont@@ ests there is on the public Facebook profile bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , which is located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to come to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and maintain a training in hair@@ dressing art , which allows them to find work .
motiv@@ ated by this activity and the possibilities of bi@@ kers have seen dozens of young people that they can take a profession which is currently in fashion .
the school received special training workshops before the beginning of March , and reported some of their accompl@@ ishments :
in 1995 we were the only specialist school in the congregation and the district where we are very proud because of love with the children we have built this education community .
Colombia : love letters to Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ak@@ ens
photo : Valent@@ ina Mon@@ sal@@ ve .
use with kind permission .
the following article is the revised version of the Beit@@ ra@@ gs &quot; Liebes@@ bidden to Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ usion@@ ists , &quot; which published the international online magazine Tea after T@@ wel@@ ve .
this contribution is published here in the framework of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write only love letters to people who we know ?
is it not yet much more important , people who feel out@@ stretched out , aff@@ ection for ?
exactly this question was the two young Colom@@ bian activists from Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Crist@@ ian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young Youth Foundation , who inspired them to write them to the campaign cart@@ as p@@ or la Re@@ conc@@ ili@@ aci@@ ón ( letters to reconciliation ) , who encouraged young people to sign gu@@ err@@ illa letters .
recently , her country was held a historic event , and they wanted to contribute their part thereof : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had closed a peace treaty with the Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ a@@ Movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary forces in Colombia ) , which forms the stage of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
International was considered to be the signing of the peace agreement as so important that the Colom@@ bian President José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his contributions to the Nobel Peace Prize .
however , in front of the column , there is a long way to talk about a real reconciliation and peace of peace .
Gu@@ err@@ illa strug@@ gles , who had lived for many years in illegal camps , were exposed to war rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic and around the clock , they have to integrate their weapons in life as an civilians .
the Colom@@ bian company again , who had reconc@@ iled to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hat@@ red against gu@@ ill@@ aries , they have to support them in their ranks , and support them in construction of a new life .
Leonardo and Crist@@ ian was convinced that the young Colom@@ bian have to close together and help the integration process .
and just this did they have : until now , thousands of young people wrote letters - love message to former gu@@ er@@ illa strug@@ gles to welcome them back in society .
the goal of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former gu@@ ill@@ ating fighters who shall be handed over personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day as an inspiration for the campaign
the idea for reconciliation was formed at the world summit of the Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ate , which took place in Bog@@ ot@@ á in February 2017 . Leonardo and Crist@@ ian had the opportunity to speak with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ arth@@ i , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this declared that we love the people whom we love to write on Valentine &apos;s Day of thousands of love letters , but those who need to need much more need@@ less .
he has told , he told us to share his love with people who needed to support the most ur@@ gent matters .
so the plan was created to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian company is ready to make the dis@@ course of a war history to a common history of peace . &quot; they say .
until now , more than 2000 letters were collected within the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities in Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ ic@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á .
&apos;@@ I would never thought that someone would forgive someone &quot;
the first 500 letters were handed over to the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on 19 March .
a group of 40 students from the University of J@@ aver@@ iana in Cal@@ i , two members of the Municipal Administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art re@@ ists to bring up the letters personally .
the members of the F@@ ARC did so on how they had done it earlier in order to accept the commands of their leader .
but this time they received no prec@@ epts , but letters full of protecting people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for all participants . &quot; it &apos;s amazing how many different feelings one can walk through to happiness and everything that is between , &quot; told the political science students Bet@@ ty Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z Av@@ ila later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the governor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience :
after having passed the letters , a former fighter made me by the camp of Gu@@ er@@ illa fighters .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ book &quot; ( a kind of cottage where the gu@@ err@@ illa lives ) , I saw a gro@@ oved which he wrote something .
I was afraid to go in , because beside him on the bed a M@@ GL pom@@ egran@@ ate , a dead@@ ly weapon in the Dor@@ n@@ ap .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I asked him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hello , what are they doing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am answering a letter which someone has written to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eless letter .
never in my life I wrote something like a nice thing , so I answer it . &quot; I suddenly ran out tears over the che@@ eks .
I h@@ ug@@ ged him completely , and set me next to the pom@@ egran@@ ate .
perhaps he was sorry for war ! I &apos;m sorry to be all the years of faithful Compan@@ ions , and wanted to help him to write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he never had something different from life than war . the F@@ ARC had never been able to store him and his six brothers before Hung@@ er@@ to@@ d . &quot; I never thought that someone would forgive someone myself for my mist@@ akes .
but now I know that there is a society there , who is waiting for us with open arms .
until now I have learned to deal with weapons .
but now where peace rules , I can learn many things and work in dig@@ nity . &quot;
new votes
a pre@@ lu@@ de came to students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC on a discussion round .
the students were all raised up as early as the war and the F@@ ARC already had already in secret places .
therefore the leader of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organization , their ide@@ als and gave insight into their views over the peace process : &quot; many years we have experienced , as we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party , we can contribute to the society in this country .
a goal of this size is worth to overcome all obstacles , &quot; said one of them .
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
these people , who had never found hearing , and not to know that humans that I have often seen as monster and even hate them , even people with beautiful feelings - have been turned by their lif@@ esp@@ an and their environment , was very painful for me .
the reality , in which the country lives , does it hurt me .
but comfort me that all men - even those who have killed and so much damage caused to bring us a little bit and a smile and a h@@ ug can give us .
many former fighters have answered the letters .
Gust@@ av@@ o Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote to the example Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Archbishop of the City of Cal@@ i , following letter :
the column was made known to reign in peace after de@@ fo@@ rest@@ ation .
but this is not the case .
as long as it is ine@@ quality , hunger and a lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are willing to lift up to the weapons and to protest their rights and that is also entirely justified ( ... ) .
we use the F@@ ARC on peace to a policy without weapons .
that is why we call all the Defender of Peace - regardless of race , religion or ide@@ ology , they are over all those who dream of a country in the war .
we give you our word , aff@@ ord our contribution and offer victims , for we know from their own experience that nothing is simple . den@@ otes for those who defend life as the basis of existence , many difficulties will be im@@ pending .
there will be many obstacles on our way , but we will overcome them together .

hom@@ osexual and que@@ er people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of d@@ angers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and comp@@ res@@ sive strength .
with terr@@ ors have experienced the reporting of the last months over the persecution of pregnant men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat , which is like a dam@@ sel @-@ value over the dor@@ sal L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q community , isn &apos;t until the night was created .
OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ z@@ ny , who shared some of their experiences with us and talked with us what is currently in the republic .
the L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has been conquered before several months after the reporting were published , which have been published the towing , torture and killing que@@ er men in the Republic of them@@ atic .
the first report was published by the journalist Elena Mil@@ ash@@ ina in Now@@ aja Gas@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities , susp@@ icious que@@ er men , and put them in secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; they brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a Trans@@ wife , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny and grew up there .
already since her childhood , she felt that she was a woman in reality .
when they were grown , it became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for them , why she went to Moscow .
after having experienced a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens from the gender equality of their land@@ lady , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina .
from fear of her life , she moved the last du@@ des into the United States .
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a volunte@@ er Hel@@ fer@@ in with a human rights organisation .
one day told me that someone needed to help my help .
it was a friend of Da@@ gest@@ an , a trans@@ wife that inst@@ alls in trouble .
she had no money , so I took it without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , he was a friend of my documents and spread them everywhere in the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent them away to his che@@ eks , with the following message : &quot; then there is no men more in Ch@@ echn@@ ya who can eliminate these reproach ? &quot;
afterwards the photos of my documents made by the whole W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
when I was just doing so , a few shopping spots from the back seat of my car I heard a male voice saying : &quot; here is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot;
when I turned me , I felt a little in my body , but I did not hurt me .
then I heard a set , but this time at Che@@ chen : &quot; how long will you be able to honor the family ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I only know that there was a young man , no 30 years old .
then I lost the consciousness and a@@ wo@@ ke the last du@@ des in the hospital .
apparently , some women had to get started and started sh@@ out .
the man was fled .
the women had a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two specimens in my right lung wings .
OC Media : in which nurse were you laid - in men or women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are ob@@ sol@@ ete , since there is still my male name dr@@ on ; but the physician stopped , and laid me for the women .
I am very grat@@ eful to him .
when I read his name for the first time in his office , I got it to do with the fear ; it was a Muslim name , a Cau@@ cas@@ ian name .
but he turned out as a good man .
I &apos;m than@@ k@@ ful to him that he had been resp@@ ect@@ fully with me .
I spent more than one month in hospital .
last February I got dr@@ au@@ ctions .
they called me , wrote me - Related , strange , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of an alp@@ habet .
my family visited from neighbours and some remote relations .
the requested that sent me to Ch@@ echn@@ ya , to prove that everything was a lie .
they set ab@@ sur@@ d claims : some told me , I had to prove it by the streets ; others wanted that I had not changed in the official television in Gro@@ z@@ y , and say that I had not changed my sex that everything was just bad , and Photoshop .
I have grain size C - what would I have to say in television ?
OC Media : how has your family tries to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it is still difficult for them .
some older people spoke at once my mother on the street .
they said to her , &quot; They have brought a monster to the world , that is not only your family , but the whole republic is ashamed .
we cannot touch you , because you &apos;re a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot;
my mother was too much and she laid a stri@@ ck around the neck .
than@@ k@@ fully , the neighbours came and saved them .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with dar@@ kened windows and a number plate with a 95 dr@@ on .
after it happened for the third time it was clear that there was slightly la@@ zy .
my human rights friends test the number@@ ing sign - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how are you fled ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for safety reasons I don &apos;t want to give her name , but I want to say that I remember them all , they have really helped me .
with their help , I left the country , but then something un@@ belief .
I can still understand how it could be .
shortly before my departure from Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
I bought it without registration , without identification , without identification .
I broke my old SIM card and cast them into the litter .
came to and check@@ ed to the hotel .
the number was registered at a fore@@ igner .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t believe you , only because you have left the country ?
our people already know , in which hotel you put on . you even know your room number .
just to prove it : it is number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine that ? !
this was really my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
but we do not talk about gender equality , however , this is a tab@@ le@@ theme .
I still carry some traditional Cau@@ cas@@ ian elements in me .
so very I wish you to overcome this se@@ al@@ an barrier I can not overcome .
I say always , as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to viol@@ ate them .
if we chat with camera , I give me good effort to look like the person from their past - thus remin@@ is@@ cent of my male form .
but this is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends do , those who are d@@ iting ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report in Washington for last week .
for whom I needed more information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I spoke with someone who left one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he was told that Ram@@ ad@@ an had not been arrested and tor@@ tured throughout the Ram@@ ad@@ an , but also that all the end of Ram@@ ad@@ an had hardly been waiting to wait , and he did not end a new wave .
most likely they are now focusing on family and relatives .
so that my opinion , they probably invite their relative to the problem with the affected person and at the end a proof of that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; through blood has experience .
OC Media : are there still pregnant men held in these secret places ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of me , there wouldn &apos;t be many .
if , especially those that have no sufficient relative or dropped from their relatives to show Kad@@ y@@ rows judgment .
as far as I know , they will be held there , so that they can present them later as terror@@ ists .
say : should they be killed , you &apos;ll show their bodies in television and claim to attack any village or military support .
do you understand ?
however , these people are not simply disappeared , but di@@ pped specifically to radic@@ alize .
OC Media : is that only a mut@@ ation or have you a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I &apos;m visiting someone who was in@@ car@@ cer@@ ated for one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their B@@ art had grown .
there has been nothing new of them since then .
they simply have taken them .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was taken even when these people were taken away .
however , until now they were not presented as band@@ its , so far there were no reports so far . we guess that such actions are quite possible .
why else if you don &apos;t have this man to shave ?
do you know if these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation that took place in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always bore my hair for ever .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think already before 2003 I was already familiar with very Gro@@ z@@ ny , when I lived there - and I never had problems .
in Ernst !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when Sh@@ aria was considered , I never had any problems .
on the contrary , it was much more secure than now .
in Russia , Russia wanted to lead us to &quot; civilian , &quot; but ultimately rejected us in the Stone Age .
OC Media : how is it possible under the Sch@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were b@@ aked ; I had coloured eyelashes , carried out the tube and short te@@ ops .
the security Ministry of Sh@@ aria has never eaten a hair even a hair .
in front of the Russian Theatre in Gro@@ z@@ ny there was a place where there was every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people like me .
it was a small place where several banks stood , and the whole city knew what men , young people met there .
we have never been insul@@ ted .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a spe@@ ech@@ less : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that means : &quot; Sp@@ otto do not over the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
you often say it often to children , when they are fun for sick .
OC Media : so they just shut down their eyes before you , because they believed that you are sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never have ended , never ch@@ ased and never sm@@ itten .
OC Media : how long did this am@@ nesty set time ?
Sab@@ rina : so long , until Kad@@ y@@ row stood on the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to speak in television about Mor@@ al .
he spoke not to us by se , but depend@@ able on the behaviour of women .
nevertheless - it was able to feel like people in the city began to change .
he who stayed before and was laugh@@ ed , looked at once with sus@@ pic@@ ion .
in the time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home , I was able to feel like the situation in the Republic constantly wor@@ sen@@ ed .
OC Media : which activities do you go now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as wa@@ it@@ ress .
I do not earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the USA .
of which I &apos;m still working as a activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communic@@ ated with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we perfectly organize Te@@ et@@ n@@ ffs , gathering and do them to the hospital and help them to get food cards .
I don &apos;t have a cents .
I have discovered this man myself when I ru@@ ff@@ ed dam@@ aging .
I am Muslim and want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : this is al@@ lied .
so , nature , that has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens , which you want to proof with foam before the mouth that there is no g@@ ay at them .
the Da@@ gest@@ ans have , who have the cab@@ ar@@ iner , who have Russians also , on the whole planet , but they are not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I &apos;m coming from there , so it &apos;s easy to hear what to hear .
here I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practic@@ ing Muslims who go to the mosque , and during Ram@@ ad@@ an f@@ asten - live with men .
do you know , many think of tran@@ sid@@ ent@@ ity of men , men love , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experience . but this is a Tru@@ ste@@ er .
these are two different things - two different kinds of sensation to be exact , different life settings .
for me it is the most important to feel me in my own skin and not ashamed for my body .
do not whether I have a partner or not .
I &apos;m sorry that I &apos;m so personally , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I &apos;m not sad at all - I don &apos;t know that I myself am now .
local groups war@@ ns before an increase of self @-@ moral within the Arab Ah@@ mad@@ az@@ i community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffer from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the local Arab population .
for the last months there has been a strong increase of self @-@ mor@@ den .
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .

the self @-@ combustion of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August , the des@@ per@@ ate situation of the Arabian Ah@@ mad@@ az@@ i community in Iran , which is dominated by poverty and unemployment .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he dwelt in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the Cher@@ wa@@ z region in the southwest of Iran .
he suffered under anxi@@ ety , depression , and he was ashamed to come up for his own Forest , who would like to work for his family , so Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i &apos;s rights groups working in Ah@@ wa@@ z and want to remain anonymous .
one on YouTube video turned the moments after he had kindled himself .
some people made it fast to er@@ ase the fl@@ ames again , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ eg@@ h@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , bur@@ ns were so strong that doctors could not do nothing more .
he died a short time later .
it was not the only suicide that has occurred in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i minority , and activists war@@ ned about that more men could take life .
the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah Mou@@ ss@@ awi and Sh@@ ah@@ ab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - started .
their stories have a matter together : there were all family members who were based on the persecution of the Iranian government , hel@@ pl@@ ess and ir@@ able to take their families to nour@@ ish and safe work .
Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , in which a large majority of the Arab ancest@@ or Arab ancest@@ or community , was sh@@ aken by a pro@@ found economic crisis , which makes it difficult to contest its native Arab population .
a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was an especially autonomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ahl@@ avi monarchy took power and took major efforts in 1925 , to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region there are some of the largest in Iran next oil and gas fields , as well as some of the most varied and most valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite this valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the native population has only little of that wealth .
it is often victims of un@@ treated diseases , hunger and discharge .
the Iranian regime ref@@ uses the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i @-@ Arab@@ s systematically work in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government also built a variety of dam@@ s , the waters of the Arab areas in the Persian areas where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and Gh@@ om are being re@@ directed .
these dam@@ s have led only to destroy the devast@@ ation in the region by d@@ rought , and local agriculture , as well as fish and palm trees .
the unemployment rate among Arab A@@ ha@@ w@@ zi @-@ adolescents rose to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian @-@ General director of co@@ operating , work and social welfare , applied that 5 % of the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is , who are looking for a job , completed primary school and have completed 45 % a university degree .
a &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot;
Kar@@ im Doh@@ im@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ mad@@ az@@ i human rights activ@@ ist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist , ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; in the number of suicide among young Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i men .
Doh@@ im@@ i said that particularly the unemployment rate has become more worse . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of in Ah@@ wa@@ z , upcoming ethnic Per@@ sians and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the setting process :
since func@@ tion@@ aries and institutions pre@@ fers to adjust Arab labour force , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i will un@@ ite access to work possibilities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime which aims to destroy the spirit of the resistance of young Arab@@ s and to force her life outside of her hom@@ eland Ah@@ wa@@ z .
there are people who had to stop their name and sur@@ names to hide their belonging to the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i , because even Arab names are not toler@@ ated in the workplace , because the speaking of the Arab language or the wearing of Arab clothing .
given the given circumstances that have to bear the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i , human rights activ@@ ist Alarm before the situation explo@@ ded .
it remains to wait , whether the world wake up and consider it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treated and self @-@ deduc@@ tible .

&quot; why not identified me with femin@@ ism identi@@ fi@@ able , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tioning
detail of a photos . recorded by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . published under the CC@@ 0 Creative Commons License .
the following article is a revised version of the opinion that was written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as website . the article was subject of several discussions that many different positions came to expression .
you can read in the comments under the original text .
when I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , many women - especially the white women who draw themselves as an internal femin@@ ists - with fr@@ ust .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
she even thought well thought out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be femin@@ ist and why we should generally be all femin@@ ist * inside .
for example , women nowadays still earn less money in spite of equal education .
that women are still under str@@ ingent observation when it is about to do with her body .
that violence against women is a global epi@@ demic .
or that cultural and social science still ensure that women are going up earlier or later in various fields of life to a glass ceiling , and that discrimination based on sex is still cross@@ wise through many different countries and belie@@ fs .
all this is aware and known .
I am convinced of it and I suffer twice and triple among them .
I am a black woman .
and yet : if I come on skin colour , on rac@@ ism , on black women in the L@@ GB@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I have been suffering from rac@@ use and discrimination , both in and outside of femin@@ ist movement , many white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , all that women - all women - should come together to come &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to sing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their voices and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ umb@@ aya , my lord &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to sing the equality ( some ) of women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but they don &apos;t want to talk about that it is in addition to sexual violence a member of assi@@ sting violence motiv@@ ated violence , who are black women exposed to two times .
or over that black women and women of other eth@@ nic@@ ations and women earn less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with migration background suppression is more often referred to as white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
or that women in black women and women with a migration background are exposed to higher risk to suffer domestic violence and violence in the partnership , as white women .
on the other hand , I want all women , all the men and all persons each have neither skin colour the same rights . on the other hand , I can &apos;t join me as a black woman , who ref@@ uses to consider un@@ just sins in their thinking , which relate to their sex as well as to the skin colour of one person .
I &apos;m exhau@@ sted and won &apos;t be able to fight for my belonging to a white femin@@ ist @-@ oriented ground@@ breaking , which still has rejected me and countless other black women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Un@@ til in 1851 he testified , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Am I no wife ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I also refused to justi@@ fy a ide@@ ology in which the black woman has become a human and mar@@ g@@ inal being . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I auth@@ ori@@ ze me to join me group@@ ies that can also absorb our customs and customs to gr@@ ate your eg@@ o@@ ec@@ cent@@ ric programme .
I won &apos;t try to push white women the importance of over@@ cutting of skin colour and gender . because some of them will continue to silence the importance of black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women are trying to honor them .
although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different heroes a home and ren@@ ounce of white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; is in its name .
I prefer@@ able to start me full and completely from femin@@ ism and to join me the movement of Wom@@ an@@ ism , which was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman , instead of me for a white femin@@ ist par@@ a@@ dig@@ m , that is so persistent that Inter@@ sec@@ tional@@ ity is celebrated as a new phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever before we define black women in our own ideas and to give us into the sphere , which are created by us for us .
Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ c@@ ana wom@@ an@@ ism : Rec@@ la@@ im@@ ing O@@ ur@@ selves ( about : Africa @-@ Wom@@ an@@ ism ) , that we can also create spaces in which they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , spiritual , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped , which make the black woman .
although some white and internal femin@@ ists are immediately called separ@@ at@@ ism and Ex@@ clu@@ sion , having read these lines , please inform yourself about the hypo@@ crit@@ es and the contra@@ di@@ ctions of femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is affected .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic area I can lift between black women and women of other cultures , because in this par@@ a@@ dig@@ m exist I exist .
I &apos;m recognized as a woman as part of this par@@ a@@ dig@@ m because of my life .
I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in a environment in which my life is neither exc@@ essive , nor igno@@ red , nor refused .
Pad@@ del@@ et against pollution : the mission of a man to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations
this post by To@@ d@@ d Reu@@ b@@ old was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine published in particular by international efforts to solve environmental problems .
in the framework of a content @-@ sharing agreement , this article will be published here again .
in the past 7 years , Nab@@ il Mus@@ a travelled again in the past 7 years - with a special attack by the Kurdistan region in Iraq . its mission is aimed to deliber@@ ate the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentation of Emil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a who explains his relationship to the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his community .
&quot; I definitely wanted to do something for the river , which we had lost as I was a child , &quot; says Mus@@ a .

Paraguay Women and her difficult fight against violence

the following article is the shortened and working version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; of Kur@@ ds . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # we@@ ili@@ ch@@ ein@@ e@@ fr@@ au@@ bin ) , which is talking about the al@@ tw@@ ave opposite women in Paraguay .
most names were changed to protect the people affected .
a police Commissioner said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez , that they had nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her exclusive partner who had become violent against her .
since the end of its relationship has been over time and the police said , her statement would be laid to the acts , but more could not do .
in case of a further wife Bal@@ bu@@ ena was used for mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment , even the acute mem@@ orative display of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez was nothing .
a few days later , the second woman moved back to her ad .
the inflation of violence against women is difficult .
if women have to display at all times , they generally receive no support for the State .
in many cases , women are also fin@@ anci@@ ally dependent on men who are mis@@ har@@ assed . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who ad@@ mit to be victims of violence at all at the prosecution authorities .
ingredients and Statistics : 2 In@@ visible mist@@ akes and a legal system that nothing under@@ going 3 Paraguay laws : good approach , man@@ age@@ ous implementation stro@@ kes and st@@ ats
it is difficult to determine how many women are really har@@ assed , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ lez , Research for Gender Research in Paraguay . &quot; there are various data and reports , but they are not even a full @-@ critical violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; says it .
however , the numbers available are al@@ ar@@ ming .
in 2015 , with the At@@ tor@@ ney General At@@ tor@@ ney 9@@ 600 ads went to domestic violence . at 70 % of them , violence against women went violence against women .
86 % of ads in the police came from women .
there were more than 5000 ads for domestic violence in the peace dishes . 86 % of ads came here .
in the survey , 40 % of women said that they were physically har@@ assed , 55 % of women said of psychological abuse .
however , these statistics show not the true magnitude of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the par@@ agu@@ an Women &apos;s Minister Ana Bai@@ ard@@ i will also be indicated only a few of these criminal off@@ ences . &quot; for every woman who will not be reim@@ bur@@ sed in Paraguay for psychological abuse , 9 women who do not do this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on every woman who will be reim@@ bur@@ sed for physical abuse , two women who do not do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared it at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since women &apos;s suicide in Paraguay no own criminal off@@ ences , the prosecution authorities may not be adequ@@ ately documented , as many women are murdered every year from their current or former partners .
by August 2016 , journalists killed at least 12 cases of women in the country .
the coordin@@ ators of Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases , in which women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , in Paraguay every ten days a woman died because of violent men .

un@@ visible mist@@ re@@ ations and a legal system that does not under@@ take
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z was the strong friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she named him the name of all their former friends .
at the beginning she didn &apos;t wanted to do this , but then after . this should always regre@@ t it .
today , Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no more with Carlos . but two years they took the psych@@ ic violence against women - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most severe recogni@@ z@@ able :
I have never thought that I would have been victim of mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment .
if I have read earlier about it , I thought that only women happen to sub@@ ver@@ t because they are led away from violent men .
I was convinced that I would never happen that .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report about the abuse through Carlos Vera .
without the name , they wrote contributions on Facebook , in which they described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during their two years relationship , and told how he had ins@@ ulated them .
many people answered their contributions , including Carlos itself . he asked rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic if he ever raised the hand against them and refused to ensure that his behaviour was also a form of mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana , why they had fallen this so long by Carlos and didn &apos;t leave him earlier .
it seemed almost as they wanted to say that victims of mist@@ re@@ ments would have at least a certain debt .
Victoria Santos , which is not made up of Paraguay , fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay , to prove that their former partner was mist@@ re@@ treated .
Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o @-@ CRE@@ O network ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) which consists of women who are all in any manner victims of abuse .
in the group you can talk to others on their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : take the women &apos;s statements .
in Vict@@ ori@@ as case everything started with psychological abuse .
her we@@ al@@ thy partner finally succeeded to convince her that she was imp@@ lo@@ osed .
then he began to beat them .
Vict@@ ori@@ as displays at the authorities without a result and also from their relatives , she received no support .
it led a process against her former partners that developed into a troubled legal struggle between Paraguay and their native country , where it mainly went about money , power and the influence of their former partner .
Paraguay laws : good approach , def@@ icient implementation
&quot; in Paraguay , there are many laws , which are very good , but not applied .
the display of abuse is a way of resist@@ ors and a fight against corruption in the j@@ udi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; says Victoria Santos .
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of UN organization for women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in the application of laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a bill was discussed under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ Ell@@ as ( # Für@@ y ) under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ Ell@@ as ( # Für@@ y ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the Movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non@@ inv@@ e@@ Wen@@ del ) are part of a campaign on Twitter which is supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original design of the law stipul@@ ates that Fem@@ izi@@ d would declare to explain and har@@ dening as it is already in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia .
accordingly , the bill was modified in some points , in order to ad@@ mit the MPs to the law that the way for the crimin@@ alization of abor@@ tions , which currently banned in Paraguay , and be punished by up to five years imprisonment .
the original bill was provided , most of the ( bureau@@ cr@@ atic and economic ) process cost , who have to bear the victims of violence themselves , if they just need to acc@@ use it and secure a safe accommodation to re@@ locate the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri argu@@ ed that the law is not effective if the legisl@@ ature does not provide sufficient financial resources .
in Paraguay , mist@@ re@@ ation is seen as part of human relationships .
here , a change must take place , so violence is no longer considered something .
whoever s@@ wis@@ s in view of these facts , it is guilty and contributes to the perpet@@ rators of the perpet@@ rators .
we have to talk so long , to mis@@ use , not more than normal .
however , on 10 November 2016 , the Law was approved in the par@@ agu@@ an Senate . previously , parts of the law was modified , among other things , a passage in cases of domestic violence to reconciliation .
the opinions about the changes are apart .
the section regarding the reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the ag@@ g@@ ressor to attack his victims .
the cancellation of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political power &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law is true as a big set@@ back .

an independent media in Oman holding an annual report after the prohibition of a newspaper .
&quot; this website was blocked due to a decision of the Ministry of Information , &quot; referring to the For@@ bidden Newspaper Az@@ am@@ n .
more than one year ago , the om@@ an authorities have closed the independent Arab @-@ speaking newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of their coverage of corruption in the sult@@ an .
You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison where he has banned one year of imprisonment .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Ab@@ ri , were also arrested and placed before the court , however , were later restored .
Oman has re@@ igns since 1970 by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid who came to power after he had sworn to his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn T@@ aim@@ ur .

the Sultan &apos;s reign is characterized by the efforts of security forces , in particular by the domestic mystery , including press freedom , limitations and human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ gger and other activists , in@@ timi@@ date and in@@ car@@ cer@@ ating .
authorities restri@@ ct peaceful and legitim@@ ate activities in the field of human rights systematically and activists , to emphas@@ ize their views on the public affairs of the country , such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online as well as offline .
the attack on the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper , its closure and closing arguments of three of their editors in the last year is a hard blow for the press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper which has been reported on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy since its inc@@ eption in 2007 , until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , security forces Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Chief Editor of Az@@ am@@ n , was published an article entitled &quot; High @-@ ranking parties &quot; hands of justice . &quot; it went to corruption in the judicial authorities and the mixture of high @-@ level officials .
in the report , government officials accused the judge of the Supreme Court in Oman under pressure to raise a judgment in an inheritance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n dated July 26 , 2016 with a report on the front page with the heading : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ ranking parties &quot; hands of Justice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the newspaper was closed at un@@ certain time after the information Secretary had given the order that , &quot; the publication and dis@@ sem@@ ination of the newspaper on every way , including online , as of August 9 , 2016 . &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the first trial proceedings against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Ab@@ ri took place before the Court of Mas@@ king .
the court sentenced three journalists to the prison pen@@ alties and ordered the final closing of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both convicted for lack of public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; and &quot; tr@@ ench of the Pre@@ st@@ ature of the State . &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was not found in addition to the violation of an audience of publication and slan@@ ders .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j was sentenced to three years of pen@@ alties and fin@@ es at alt@@ itudes of 3000 om@@ an Ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) , and a one @-@ year professional for@@ b@@ ation was imposed on both journalists .
al @-@ Ab@@ ri was sentenced to a year jail and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 2600 US dollars ) , after using the use of a information network for spreading material that could represent a danger for public order . &quot;
for Al @-@ Ab@@ ri , a damage deposit of 5000 om@@ an Ri@@ al ( 13 000 US dollars ) was established and released on 22 August 2016 before the judgment of the prison .
on 26 December 2016 , the Appeals Court acquitted Al @-@ Ab@@ ri , however , sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari to six months in prison .

the Appeals Court also lifted the decision of the Ministry of the Ministry to conclu@@ de the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
in spite of the decision of the court , Az@@ am@@ n again , the newspaper looks like attacks against attacks by the Iranian government .
on 8 January , the Ministry of Information received a statement showing the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Ministry of Information personally signed a further statement in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , and that the minister turned again against the decision of the Appeals Court to re@@ tire the publication of the newspaper .
the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where Oman at the youngest time was injured .
for example , the closure of the site of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on the Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper in the country , will stop its operation .
due to the ongoing closing of Az@@ am@@ n and the arrest of journalists Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ an authorities are still not willing to prepare an end to the extensive violation of the press freedom .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the Ottoman authorities to :
1 . help You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ conditional ;
2. to establish a safe environment for the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper , so that their journalists can follow their work ;
3 . protect the press freedom in the country and
4 . under all circumstances that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman may uns@@ af@@ e their right human rights work un@@ hin@@ dered and without fear of stra@@ ight@@ forward measures , including judicial im@@ aging .
the Golf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization , the human rights def@@ enders ( including independent journalists , blo@@ gger , lawyers etc . ) in the Gulf region and in ad@@ joining states by the promotion of Mein@@ l and Associ@@ ations , and to protect himself peace@@ fully , and provides them protection .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and failure
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ ors 2016 in Zambia , is carried out with his understanding
medical research in Africa is only rare or not mentioned in the media . this is a growing range that addressed one of the most ur@@ gent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for that on site , there are two reasons : for a lack of global health , many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the special medical need on the African continent .
disease such as AIDS , tuber@@ culosis and malaria have in the p@@ oo@@ rest countries of Africa far more serious consequences than elsewhere , and lack of investments in research by pharmac@@ ies are a big problem .
secon@@ dly , research , which is carried out by African scientists , is helping to develop own research capacity in Africa . a major role of science and technology can only be eligible for economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ ors is Director of the Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
he grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epi@@ demic showed the first serious impact on national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Louis@@ iana , later in Indiana .
as Post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he studied himself on HIV @-@ virus , before he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ ic healthcare system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. Warri@@ ors discussed about the future of medical research in Zambia and concerning mis@@ understanding of the media about these research .
( Dis@@ claim@@ er : Dr. Warri@@ ors speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ ors RW : at the moment the focus of my work on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ ic national program for anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I just start a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ o@@ gens .
G@@ v : what are the most important scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there are no basic research . we only rely on solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this has to change , otherwise we will always be your recipi@@ ent instead of being M@@ acher .
the solutions that we get , are often not applicable in our environment , and sometimes it is impossible to use them here .
g@@ v : where does funding and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find appropriate researchers for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are well funded differently .
it is difficult to find people who come back or go here , because financing and development chances are better in other countries .
g@@ v : how is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work that you haven &apos;t had previously ?
RW : basic infrastructure does not correspond to standards in developed countries . it costs much money to have continuous supply with electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries .
g@@ v : how is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there are already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would propose that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
g@@ v : how large is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus on , and how can we support the development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I &apos;ve seen great students of all age classes .
there are demand for special scientific training , starting from every age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , research of the space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and inf@@ ectious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it .
g@@ v : can you describe the advantages and dis@@ advantages of life as scientists in Africa compared to Western countries , based on your experience ?
RW : often there are limited speed , things to do , and the full access to scientific expertise , which represent challenges here .
the system that magazines are only accessible for payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limited the amount of available information and speed of research .
from the USA to India : like &quot; Open Source &quot; seed producers to change global food production
this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the En@@ si@@ a.com website , a magazine that provides solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mort@@ on breed already in the USA since the 1980s .
his company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ ress , the first plant cultivated by NASA ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts in space and has been consumed .
for almost 20 years , Mort@@ on &apos;s work was only given through its own simpli@@ fication and the question how many varieties of sal@@ ts can be set .
but at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more sal@@ ads were patented , and that it could not be used for breeding .
the patents are not only for individual varieties , but also for certain properties like resistance to diseases , a special rotor or ru@@ d@@ led leaves .
over the past years , more of such patents have been filed for more and more plants such as grain or cart@@ ograph@@ ers . due to this trends , plant bre@@ eders , environ@@ ment@@ ers and expert food security concerns the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia @-@ old tradition , Mort@@ on still revolution@@ ized mort@@ on , but he needs more and more , since its work is still worth the limits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is , than in a river a rock sli@@ pped , in order to get off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so we have to make it right now , but it is a break with breeding tradition , &quot; says he . &quot; I think that these patents will go far too far .
and when it stops before court , no one can breeding more of new sal@@ ads , because all the features are already patented . &quot; he makes it as good as possible and tried to breeding those traits , which he wants .
however , he is very careful and lab@@ elled to use no material that is protected as a spiritual property .
in addition , he is also connected to a movement that will always be bigger in the US and anywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; ) .
ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have red Rö@@ mer@@ sal@@ at of the Sor@@ te Out@@ red@@ ress at the &quot; greenh@@ ouses &apos; of the station and eaten . there we have been tested if plants can be cultivated in space .

it &apos;s no co@@ incidence that this name rather sounds as sounds like the movement from the IT sector and not from the field of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; open @-@ source &quot; seeds ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software , which provides alternatives to copyright protected software .
it was launched to life in order to ensure that some plant species and gene are not fully protected as a spiritual property and are suitable for plant bre@@ eders .
as part of the initiative , called Oss@@ i , you can under@@ take US bre@@ eders that others can use them free from them .
this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it . &quot; open Source &quot; bre@@ eders allow only others to bre@@ athe in to make their own varieties , and it will not be able to destroy them - two aspects that are prohibited by many plant pat@@ ties or prescribed by many plants .
dozens of bre@@ eders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its start in 2014 .
whis@@ per@@ ed views
Professor for emer@@ itus status of the University of Wisconsin @-@ Madison and Oss@@ i board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control of the seed and the opportunity to breeding new plants , both important for food security and environmental protection .
seeds plays a role in larger coh@@ esion such as biodiversity , rights of the pe@@ as@@ ants , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eders would try to use the latter not or only little more by using seed with natural resistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphas@@ izes the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open @-@ source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; movement does not work with genet@@ ically modified plants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genet@@ ically modified or not , from ecological agriculture , and Mon@@ san@@ to and Bayer , who is offered in August or September 2016 , should also know that the way is being produced on the farm markets , should also know that the way is cultivated as such vegetables is threatened .
dietary sover@@ eign without seed sover@@ eign is not possible . &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative under@@ take to ensure that their seed may continue to be freely available . in contrast , their anticip@@ ation is to be patented in contrast , seed and plant features .
photo of Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
Oss@@ i Suppor@@ er argu@@ ed that the future of food supply is end@@ anger@@ ed because the available gene pool is due to the always more numerous intellectual property rights on plant material , which is therefore always restricted , in@@ eff@@ able shr@@ inking .
Claire Lu@@ by , executive director of Oss@@ i , has engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation for carrots and their availability . it found that approximately one @-@ third of all boxes are protected as intellectual property , which is not suitable for plant bre@@ eders either not or not worthy .
for other plants there are not such estimates , but experts like Lu@@ by means that mass@@ acres , as wheat in even larger style can be patented as salad or carrots .
a question of visual identity
plants are so far@@ med that they have targeted specifically features - from such that their taste or their colour is improving up to such as they th@@ ri@@ ves in certain environments such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents in plant characteristics indicate that the available plant material for bre@@ eders increases by increasingly more patents . genetic diversity is currently more need@@ less than ever before , since the changing conditions are worse predicted by climate change .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ speaking Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to announce that genetic diversity is generally important and also key for Mon@@ san@@ tos activities . with a total of four com@@ banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States set itself the company for the maintenance of genetic diversity .
however , it contra@@ dic@@ ts the view that spiritu@@ ally owned other breeding cabinets , as &quot; patents and the protection of plant varied innovation . &quot; a patent is basically taken , a plan that everyone can follow , as soon as the patent has expired .
often these instructions help others to come with another method to the same result .
such a protection has not in@@ hib@@ its innovations , but promotes it by the public more material and know @-@ how . &quot;
mort@@ on looks different : 20 years to wait until a patent strap is certainly no innovations .
and if it is so long to wait for plants that have been adapted to plants , they have already lost the fight .
but the main argument of mort@@ on is that genetic resources must always be a general well and there should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant bre@@ eders have neither the time nor money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ et@@ ric incenti@@ ves are not attractive for us .
we want to make farmers work easier .
that is what drives us , and it is impossible to use us if we are not able to use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot;
in total , Mort@@ on can be patented on the concept of themselves , vegetable features : &quot; we are creating the characteristics of itself .
the plants form them itself and as bre@@ eders , we ultimately have no idea how the plants do that .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for Carol Dep@@ pe , plant breeding in the US State Oregon and Oss@@ i Executive Board , there is still another important aspect of the plant breeding : &quot; who breeding a care , and breeding his own values in them .
those who believes in industrial agriculture with large farms and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ ture believes that cultiv@@ ating her@@ b@@ icides are needed , breeding in his varieties of this concept .
my concept is contrary to exactly . &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized enterprises ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than e.g. Mon@@ san@@ to have ) patents , creating the most smaller seed companies , even without patents , they refuse to be very expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both are the case .
the independent plant bre@@ eders Frank Mort@@ on is looking for its breeding garden Sal@@ ads .
photo of Karen Mort@@ on .
Mort@@ on is also the view that bre@@ eders would be innovative by the Av@@ oid of plant pat@@ rons : &quot; it looks like that I was able to produce something new in my efforts to make something new , the company that patented .
I need a new material for my catalog , since I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a few years itself , &quot; says he . &quot; with a patent is being protected for 20 years before competition , where you simply make it very nice . &quot; global reson@@ ance
although the US seems to be leader in the &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding , the concept spreads very quickly around the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which itself describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources , is a &quot; open @-@ source &quot; seed program works in the center with farmers , helping them breeding new varieties that meet particular requirements .
it also supports them to come to &quot; Open Source &quot; seeds and sell their own .
the German organization Agre@@ ements works on an &quot; open @-@ source &quot; license which ultimately became a formal and legally binding form of Oss@@ i &apos;s commitment to bre@@ eders in the European Union .
( rules for the breeding shall differ from country to country , but because Oss@@ i obligation can not just be taken over one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
in early November 2016 , the executive board of the European Union , the European Commission declared that conventi@@ onally far@@ med plants should not be pat@@ is@@ able . thus , it speaks against the present practice of the European Patent , the patents are allowed in conventional plants .
however , a declaration is not yet a law ; now it is to the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line .
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seeds and representatives of governments , non @-@ governmental organizations and seed companies from all over East Africa to learn something about the &quot; Open Source &quot; seed movement and the global trend for sponsor@@ ship of seeds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; program for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that the organization is currently planning a worldwide alliance for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the scheduled next year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a merger from environmental protection and development groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development organization US@@ C Canada and the action group on ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has put together a database to seeds and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Ess@@ ential - a Verb@@ und of aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - publishes a report . it represents the possibility that farmers have to come and improve seed policy to ensure that a stable supply can be ensured with food products .
in the report it is emphas@@ ised the importance of a varied , local supply with seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection between the Oss@@ i by Oss@@ i hop@@ ing that soon more people will recognize him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has hardly ever been tested , and seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now trying to make people clear that more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest goals of the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in Egypt
still un@@ lock the Egyptian authorities content on the Internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a column .
on the weekend of 05.@@ August the Egyptian government locked up the website of the German Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ H@@ RI ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world , and reports on independent reports .
in August , the network released a statement on Facebook which critic@@ ized the Egyptian authorities for this step sharp and promised to continue the work and efforts of human rights in the region .
the German Network for Human Rights Information Stay in spite of this attack and the constitution of the Egyptian law and the Constitution to defend this goal , so it was never so important to escape these goals and not to be so important . AN@@ H@@ RI has confirmed that all technical options have been exhau@@ sted to overcome the blocking of the earth and not to ad@@ mit . we wait waiting to meet our task .
AN@@ H@@ RI is considered the first cen@@ sored web organisation in Egypt after the authorities block the independent News page MA@@ DA Mas@@ r , an Arab @-@ language issue of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Al Jaze@@ era network of Al Jaze@@ era due to alleged terrorism . &quot;

besides AN@@ H@@ RI , there is no access to the blog of the column and human rights ab@@ duc@@ ers Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada .
Zi@@ ada took his blog for the spreading of column and articles that he is not available in Egypt for free websites and media .
now the blog , whom he set up in order to avoid the en@@ ig@@ ration of the Egyptian government , even the goal of attack .
blo@@ gger who is located at the name of Zi@@ ada blog , however , is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity , after being reported by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he reported on the student protests , and recorded a video like the police force against two students .
his article turn mainly for politics and human rights in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada said to the pl@@ aza through the government and refle@@ cting what this means for him :
however , blo@@ gs to lock is very old , however , has been priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even if the re@@ jection of the blo@@ gs could not be meaning@@ fully for the world , it is for me there for two reasons :
1 ) It is succeeded to mediate me the feeling of a siege management ; An arrest , a su@@ peri@@ ority , for@@ charge at the National Security Council , the re@@ jection of blo@@ gs and any other website I worked for which I worked .
2 ) You have proven that I did not wrote in vain . in other words , my words have influence , if only on a small audience .
I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first , I used it to the post of articles to deal with the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship .
but now , after they have blocked him , and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the b@@ ays go up to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( AF@@ TE ) locked Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06 August 133 websites . this result of technical tests in networks of various Internet Service Provider ( IS@@ P ) , among others Orange , Vod@@ af@@ one and Et@@ is@@ al@@ at .
AF@@ TE also documented the blocking of providers by using Internet @-@ sur and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
AF@@ TE reported in their research :
on Monday , June 12th we started how the wave of websites that V@@ P@@ N@@ s began .
a such practice indicates the intention of the government to block contents , continue to block contents and have to access the Egyptian users .
the situation will bring additionally the situation to be taken behind closed doors , thereby reducing the Egyptian population has no legal basis , so that the Egyptian population may not proceed against this actions .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and who will attack them next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants cont@@ end .

day for day newspapers reports from Rio de Janeiro in Brazil , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard moti@@ fs .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old was shot &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Thi@@ eves Phar@@ m@@ acy with military weapons &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; President Tim@@ er sends 8500 soldiers of the army , Marine and Air Force to Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in a cl@@ amped financial situation , the capital 2017 in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years .
the global non @-@ governmental organisation Global Justice even called the United Nations to access .
reports like these are always daily and this is un@@ acceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; you will find at least the manager of a local newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report published for the detailed reporting of violence in Rio known newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; on August 16 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is not normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which she announced , a new section called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war in Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published there .
the moti@@ fs for their decision declared the news :
extra will continue to report about crimes , which happen in any big city on the world like murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual disorders , etc . everything , however , will happen in the section &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative to close as journalists don &apos;t close our eyes before the mo@@ ist .
in a four @-@ minute video that was dealt on Facebook , Oct@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the editor of the paper , that this decision was no reason for pride , but rather a sign of the failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper in the world with a war ru@@ in in a country that doesn &apos;t recognize the war .
in the same video , a journalist declared that it is according to the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro and 8@@ 43 territories , which will be controlled by criminal organizations .
in the editorial , the newspaper writes :
we aware that a war discre@@ tion , if it is distor@@ ted , also to be used , im@@ pover@@ ishment of the police , which only shoot and then issues to dec@@ eive .
but we defend the war on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose aim is not the civilian population , but the economic power of m@@ af@@ ia and their partners .
does the name &quot; War &quot; be used more than they ?
in an article on the News Portal The Inter@@ cept Bras@@ il argu@@ ed the journ@@ alism in Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , the violence as &quot; War &quot; . this is due to justi@@ fi@@ able security policy through the media and could make it difficult to withdraw responsibility for the police .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and worse planning - as an extra in the analysis of the military interest rates in Rio itself - in combination with in@@ sufficient investments in personnel , En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment and a historical and self @-@ pleasing distribution of public service .
in memory : the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than its capital .

Rio de Janeiro as &quot; the violent country in Brazil , &quot; is false according to Cec@@ í@@ lia : &quot; 22 of the 30 violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics of 2015 in the north and northeast of the country . these are the latest available data .
no one of these cities is in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
if we are looking forward to mor@@ nings per state of state , Rio is at No. 16 , &quot; it writes .

to these security measures also the founding of U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia Paci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the Federal State of Rio in 2003 , whose aim is to capture a Fav@@ ela police offering and a unit permanently to be station@@ ed there .
initially this led to a decline of violent deaths . for a few years , U@@ PP was able to protect against poor communities against poor communities , which should actually protect the ne@@ c@@ ous police unit .
on his Facebook page cited by journalist João Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux from one of his article in 2010 , in which he explains why violence in Rio do not comply with the criteria specified by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the name &quot; Civil War . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal questions , the classification of the situation in Rio takes a serious consequences for people after the war .
for this calls for the state , means and ways to use , which is typical for war . this is the territory of a &quot; fine , &quot; where a civilian is a sharp point in the landscape and is an object for &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; and &quot; ir@@ oned bul@@ lets . &quot;

the East Gh@@ out@@ a region is particularly affected , where an attack against chemical weapons were killed on 21 August 2013 .
many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition , based on the basis of projects of the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the mass@@ acres committed by the Assad regime .
since 2013 , these reb@@ els have been controlled by re@@ bel areas outside Damascus in the siege of siege , which resulted in local residents , or by the tunnel and control points .
through the years of block@@ ade , traditional foods are easily accessible as meat for large parts of the population .
in contrast , a group of Syrian humanitarian aid workers and academ@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , as they can reduce their own mushrooms as &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ near and perform the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms do not belong to the conventional , planted in Syria and are only extremely rare part of Syrian cuisine . however , however , it makes it an attractive food source for many residents of the East Gh@@ out@@ a .
the Direc@@ tion of the Project , Sub@@ way Nab@@ il , said about the French News Agency AF@@ P :
&quot; we op@@ ted for the cultivation of mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them into houses and cell@@ ars . &quot;
Dr. Ahmed L@@ eil@@ a , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that , for three years , has been fighting for this project , making this project well @-@ known and pressed its relief to it more and more . &quot;
to collect money for the initiative , use in consultation with the NGO Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ nigh da the humanitarian C@@ row@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ do .
it is planned to produce 125 families of plant@@ ing pil@@ es such as Dr. L@@ eil@@ a to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of this article , they reached over 100 % of their expected target of around 12.@@ 700 € , but will continue to be collected on Can@@ don until Monday , 04 September 2017 .
the initiative is based on generators which keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity of 80 % .
because of the fuel layer , locally produced fuel from plastic are used to supply generators with the necessary energy .
Dr. L@@ eil@@ a said Global Vo@@ ices that they began with &quot; production from the regions of the fung@@ us , before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption .
afterwards they planted a small mushroom yard in a tub . as this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on .
now they have designed a &quot; apprenti@@ ces@@ hip yard for the region . &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months they have distributed mushrooms in East Gh@@ out@@ a for free .
Dr. L@@ eil@@ a explained that it is part of a greater movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to bring people the fung@@ us breeding of various reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : fra@@ cture of the siege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
provision of a new food source on the market .
spread of a culture of self @-@ supply by eating waste ( like paper , tea , coffee , cardboard , etc ) to profit of new foods .
create new jobs , especially for women who work home .
creation of new work@@ places for people with disabilities , which are bound to their home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to spread this idea in all over the world , so our success as well as our fight against hunger and siege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to insp@@ ire our experience in crisis areas and we can help mankind . &quot;

Portuguese demand for Justice for the victims of fires in 2017
several hundred people protest@@ ed on 21 October in many districts in Portugal and called for justice to the victims of fires that gr@@ assi@@ c in the north of Portugal in the week .
two and forty people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires between 15 and 16 October . this led the government last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
fires were also registered in the G@@ ali@@ zi@@ en region , where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fi@@ ves , which spread themselves in the northern and central regions of the country , about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande occurred a similar tragedy in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to the European forestry system , which monitors the forest areas via satellite , in 2017 alone , about 500,000 acres of forest are burned - an area of the size of the Lisbon district .
so that you can do a better picture of the Ernst of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .

the se@@ eable tragedy
the goal of the protests of Saturday was the demand for better pre@@ vent@@ ative and fire fighting measures by the state .
the people asked why the civil protection was not able to em@@ bra@@ ise the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
João Sover@@ al produced by the Federation of farmers from Portugal to the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão roads and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did this no@@ where : there are dozens of open streets of open roads which were shut down by fire .
in the forest of Lei@@ ria would have had a similar tragedy such as in June , as the streets were blocked very late . &quot;
furthermore , construction permits in ec@@ tur@@ t@@ issues are post@@ pon@@ ed with a high Bran@@ dr@@ is@@ iko .
a wide suggest@@ ion to the Wal@@ gre@@ form , who had brought the government after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was founded by the commun@@ es , who saw the new rules as a barrier to investment .
&quot; the government led a loos@@ ening of the law , which allowed the case of construction in case of case , if the applic@@ ant could lead to self @-@ protection - this was an open background door so that everything could be built , &quot; João Sor@@ val leads to the same article in the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o .
the environmental organisation Quer@@ cus made sure that large areas with eu@@ cal@@ ypt@@ us , trees made of slight combust@@ ible wood , as in a Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ ov , to spread out this kind .
these problems added that the website of the civil protection of Portugal on 15 and 16 October , as residents sought or tried to contact those who was offline .
it was a private initiative which provided the people with information : you used the own civil protection data using the application f@@ og@@ os.@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developers of João P@@ ina to simpli@@ fy the work of the Fire Brigade in October , so that the server pursued the ons@@ lau@@ ght of 400,000 users , which followed fires , was not counted as a half a million .

the way from refugee from Afghanistan to successful entrepren@@ eurs

during a night in the fall of 1994 , the Taliban kick@@ ed off through the Taliban .
two years before , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ jah@@ ed@@ in group , who had defeated short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . Afghanistan had become a country of terror and desp@@ air .
just at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ ha@@ zn@@ i , in the province of G@@ ha@@ zn@@ i , the last time with his family at dinner together .
even if his mother did not say it then she didn &apos;t know that she would not see her son much longer - maybe even more .
the boy should breaking up in dawn .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ election , had just been murdered by the Taliban , and many Haz@@ ara felt themselves suddenly .
the Taliban were ever closer to Haz@@ ara @-@ well @-@ known Taliban .
many Haz@@ ara left the country in direction Pakistan or Iran .
some days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan .
a few years he worked in a coh@@ ab@@ ru@@ be . work was hard and made him sick .
then he took the what was left of his low wages , and went into Iran . once again he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and worse sacks with mort@@ ars , which were heavier than he himself to make his li@@ vel@@ ih@@ ood .
at that time , as today , the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was characterized by mis@@ ery and exploitation .
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived in an empty building on the building site , which we also worked .
there was no services there and no heating . we built nylon in front of the open window so that we didn &apos;t reach night at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without Pap@@ ers in Iran and made herself ready for the trip to Europe .
during the dangerous journey on the sea , he suffered ship@@ wreck and stran@@ ded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum request , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 .
some time was A@@ shar@@ af hom@@ eless , running alone in the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed twice a day of food to aid needs .
it is true that Italy due to relatively high ir@@ rig@@ ation quot@@ as is a kind of chance for past asylum seek@@ ers . however , it is true also that the conditions that asylum seek@@ ers in the country are cat@@ astroph@@ ic .
the Human Rights Organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system is suff@@ ers under a general lack of transparency .
the large majority of asylum seek@@ ers is housed in the more than 3000 &quot; special recording centres . &quot; they are impro@@ vised by impro@@ vis@@ ated facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot;
according to Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be allocated to a reception center if it officially applied for asylum - which can go for months after the registration of the asylum request .
until then people are people who have no money for accommodation , either to the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the road .
so it was also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his imm@@ ick life helped A@@ shar@@ af to liber@@ ate yourself from these conditions .
after he had made several years of working in the construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ af put his entire savings in the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice .
this was so good that after a while he opened a second hostel and a speed lim@@ estone .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ at@@ is success story is now the theme of the &quot; handic@@ raft Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) director of Am@@ in Wah@@ i@@ di .
the film received the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was launched by 2017 .

the terms of entrepren@@ eurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
many bureau@@ cracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are only some of obstacles .
according to un@@ official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transition solution on the way to other European countries .
in the past few years , some of the Afgh@@ ans were created , among them cutting parties , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some af@@ gh@@ an@@ ian restaurants were even blessed in the Italian press for her excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ m@@ adi had the idea of his restaurant Oriental Experience , in which the cell@@ ars and the kitchen personnel are mainly refugees from various parts of the world .
the menu of restaurant tells of the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts , the history of their journey to Italy .
Afghan entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizz@@ eria of Kab@@ ul@@ og@@ na in Bologna and a S@@ ush@@ i restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
A@@ shar@@ af@@ s aims , however , far beyond the Italian gastronom@@ y industries and the retail trade and targets to the country , which he had to leave as teen@@ ager .
&quot; where a risk is , there are also possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan .
I never forget my country and I can &apos;t live happy if I know that my people suffer .
I have a project for farmers from the p@@ oo@@ rest provinces of the country , especially for women .
they represent half of society and need to get the same possibilities as all others . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af has also plans to learn plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul in which the human packaging and preserv@@ atives can learn . &quot; so , they can sell their harvest on the market and improve their financial situation . &quot; he says .
development on the successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through un@@ certainty and doub@@ ts , but at the end stand stability and prosper@@ ity .
A@@ shar@@ af made this journey itself . now he wants to help others in Afghanistan on this path .

the Egyptian Parliament checks a bill that provides that users can use social media like Twitter or Facebook only after registration in a government authority .
users have to be able to use social networks , within six months after successful legislative decree on the website of the authority of the authority of the full name , as well as their selection number .
those who missed this stage could be sentenced to up to six months of imprisonment or final payment of a penalty .
the law , which was banned by sixty parliamentary members , is currently the processing of the Parliament and to the constitutional committee of the Parliament and shall be deb@@ ated there .
in May , another deputy proposal to become a bill , in the har@@ der pen@@ alties for the ins@@ ult of the president or a high civil servants would be introduced .
under Egyptian law is the ins@@ ing of the president and state @-@ state institutions already pun@@ ish@@ able . under the law , such a crime happened , however , with a prison and fin@@ nish classes , the presi@@ dency of Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
if the Act shall be passed , this may mean up to three years in prison for crimes .
in addition , this would be an political climate in which the right to free expression and freedom of freedom has been in danger for many years .
a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud subscription Z@@ id ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he fought against demonstr@@ ators that led against the military coup that led to the military coup of the elected president Mohammed Mor@@ si .
in the same incident , Sha@@ w@@ kan was waiting for more than 700 protest participants who had been arrested during the same incident , four years in prison on a court .
recently , his trial was post@@ pon@@ ed on 20 May , because the prison line according to human rights groups failed to bring the accused of prison in the court hall .
Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups , im@@ pet@@ us of other weapons , illegal assembly , murder , and su@@ peri@@ ors .
in another case , a criminal court in G@@ iz@@ a spoke of two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were indicted for their coverage in pro @-@ Mor@@ si sitting block@@ ade on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya Square in Cairo .
the court also reduced the pen@@ alties of the journalist Abdullah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mustafa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly who were also arrested at the af@@ ore@@ mentioned incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
Tun@@ es@@ ian activists to inter@@ ro@@ gated documents
in May , Tunis@@ ian authorities spent six hours with the pol@@ r of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , who co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ ate and the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia was mainly for@@ warded to a well @-@ sent action plan . according to the plan expressly , by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Ab@@ id@@ ine Ben Ali , the corruption accused the official am@@ nesty under the rule of the plan , provided all those un@@ justified money received .
the document published on 21 April on the site of Na@@ wa@@ at , designs a light on how the pre@@ sidi@@ ous plans look up to the support of the legisl@@ ature .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia refused the separation of his sources under article 11 of the Tunis@@ ian press code which journalists sec@@ ures the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless he joined the District Court in Tunis on 09 May as a witness in the event .
will China force the users of social media to submit their identity ?
according to new rules of the government &apos;s information office of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China require licence before they write messages in social media .
in the provisions it is stated that the registration will be required with the full real name .
analy@@ st estimates that through the elim@@ ination of anonymous comments in entertainment within social networks , it is now un@@ clear how the authorities will apply these rules .
Chinese networks have suggested to ass@@ ert these regulations in the social media to protect these regulations in order to protect civil journ@@ alism and independence .
see you then in &quot; We@@ chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
May locked the state c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of Russia to access the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app .
according to Ros@@ kom@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or , We@@ chat has decided to register for the &quot; organiz@@ ational of the Information Pro@@ liferation . &quot;
this designation is part of a law from 2014 , thanks to the Russian government to organize a list of online services , which allows the &quot; publication of information . &quot; the government also allows operators to make content responsible for removing content and to force them on request .
for these websites , there are currently websites such as V@@ contacts and Od@@ no@@ classi@@ cs ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service mail@@ .ru and dozens of other services .
Turkish court has pl@@ ain@@ ment Wikipedi@@ as
a Turkish dish took the wave of Wikipedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administrative rators refused to er@@ ase two English articles , the information that Turkey under@@ stands the jihadists in Syria .
the Turkish Ministry of Transport , maritime Affairs and Communication , had been closed on the site because they collabor@@ ate to &quot; a source of information leading to groups in order to tackle a political diff@@ usion campaign against Turkey . &quot;
it is the first time that Turkey has blocked the web site . it is thus that China , one of the few countries worldwide , where access to Wikipedia is not possible .
great Britain can &apos;t stop , ref@@ res@@ h
following this week , in this week , the government of Great Britain is located in the midst of a targeted consultation with regards increased surveillance , the Internet service providers would force to monitor communications in real time and to install Backdoor @-@ programs that de@@ cryp@@ ts data encryption .
however , the government has consul@@ ted a t@@ elecommunications company and secret services related to the pres@@ crip@@ tions , but has left other technology companies and the civilian populations .
despite this , the consultation will continue until May 19 . reactions and proposals by members of the public may be for@@ warded to the Interior Ministry .
