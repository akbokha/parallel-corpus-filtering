<seg id="1">Although I had visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love to America is extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="4">As many of my generation I grew up with American films, I have read and operated with American music, American authors and his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had a derarable effect on me that I became mainly because of an American film journalist.</seg>
<seg id="6">As 14-year-old I saw the great Denzel Washington as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a fearful reporter with the help of Julia Roberts as Jura student, the Supreme Court of Justice to judge his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">Free to Method Man, "I was it as if that is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that is what I want to do with my life."</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year that I lived in Arizona, had only reinforced my admiration for the USA.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "I always said:" "" "America is the only country where I have ever lived, whose diversity is so welcoming, that you always have always who you are and it is easy Acceptance in a community of equality people." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had a very annoying love letter beyond his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump arrived.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most exceptional aspect of his ascension is to me as he is going to face with its commitment.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never holds behind the mountain, as you says so nice.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he considers, like a former colleague, and explains publicly his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afroamerican and Women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, people responded to his statements and approved in droves for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes, who won the Republican elections, was the highest number one of the candidate won by the party.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans that support these biguots person, I asked me?</seg>
<seg id="21">I was able to bear Trump and his voters not to learn with people who had learned during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">As for example, Professor Dr. Bill Silcock, Director of the Journalism programme, people from all over the world, a deep breath-man, with whom I could talk about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Trumps also backed by Peter Bhatia, the present editor of the "Cincinnati Inquirer," agreed.</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to view the Phoenix Suns "at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps Intoleranz is also in contrast to the generosity, which I experienced with Sandy Bahr, who fights against the environment for life, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like their son.</seg>
<seg id="26">She yet fits them to the dedication of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with a lot of patience and wormwood and my colleagues to accustomed us to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors who helped me too much with my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and those caused by them deepens my love to America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump raged his way to the nominated Republican Presidential candidate, they gave me a halt and the equivalent of his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016 over 50 million Americans, mostly white, the presidency of a man, despite - or maybe just due to its contempt against non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The confrontation with the idea that people voted for Trump, because they were either disobedient to their racism and fanaticism, or because they were prepared to overlook these things, and broke me almost the heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair the Trump-elector as Rassists.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "the people enter," "" "said one of my friends, is exactly what has led us to this situation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficially and respectfully and indicates an inability to understand those who do like a different way and do.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows the people that their worries and fears about hectic changes in their congregations will not be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, of which most of them are, voted for Trump, because they would like to regain control of a country that they have disappointed?</seg>
<seg id="38">With other words, they may say that they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, you cannot forget the words of David Remnick, who comments the cruel decision to raise a man who looks back down with contempt to those who look like it.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "this" "" "Whitelash" "" "(Anm.): as much as" "" "rejection of white to all other ethnicities," "" "Speaking of white in play on the White and whiplash, which means that the big Van Jones called" "" "has exactly what happened to America so great." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions people around the world estimate the American ideal - whether the myth or reality, it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which faith or background you can always have, America is worth each welcome.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this land chose as his president, twice the son of a Kenianity, whose history, as he himself says that is nowhere else in the world.</seg>
<seg id="44">However, with the Donald Trumps election, however, there is a huge part of the white America's promise and says: to Hell with frequent, religious freedom and the whole term of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In the Americas after 9 / 11, the white man again will say.</seg>
<seg id="46">In all this I have to think about Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a rally for Hillary Clinton had a word change with human consumption.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would have been my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your America?" he asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">The quantity responded with a loud voice "No!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"do Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" rocking the quantity.</seg>
<seg id="52">"have Latinos a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered them.</seg>
<seg id="54">Have Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they called them and their voices were pure." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"don't someone who doesn't like you to make a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a referential and loud "NEIN"!</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan ended with the words: "God be thanked to Mr. Trump, is that not your America." 36 hours later he was added.</seg>
<seg id="59">The country, for which his son was fallen, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is Trumps Country, saying the message.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people, like Mr. Khan, could no longer be found in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaketh me my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero commune in the province of Oaxaca with the children of the paraguaean city of Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">The music that is played at both places does not only have changed the life of the children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump, just 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists, but worlds removed from the nearby precolossal ruins and its world-famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For some years now the La Banda de MÃºsica (Musikbande) has been playing in the community: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, with their musical instruments one possibility to overcoming the surrounding poverty.</seg>
<seg id="74">A musical school of 100 students has become a central interest for the church of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The municipality, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its Drugs abuse and the Banden Violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">However, this changed after an accidental meeting with a French pilots, who started a musical project and the youth offered a rare hopes.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take care of their obligations compared to the music group, the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI writes:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come from the school, they walk back home and immediately after lunch they run through dusty roads to follow their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They come always laughing and with shiny eyes and play in the bustle you learn day for trumpet, trombone, Piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timbrel, Bongos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from rubbish</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7.000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero play the children of Cateura - a village, which is practically at the largest garbage dump of AsunciÃ³n in Paraguay, is based on instruments which are made from recovered waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with recovered instruments, made from local firm waste materials, made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura where the recycling of Favio ChÃ¡vez started to transform parts of the waste in instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitate violin, viola, Celli, double bass, guitars, saxophones, trumpets, trumpets, trombones, trombones, trombones, trombones, trombones and percussion.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguan and Latin American music and music of the Beatles, from Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article in the Los Angeles Times, Favio ChÃ¡vez remembers a local economist and music teacher of the children of Cateura to the initial time:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no space for rehearsals and we had to teach at the same place where the parents knew no music and it was very difficult to contact parents, because many of them do not live with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">That changed when Favio was shown something that he had never seen before: one made from waste produced violin.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today, there is a whole orchestra which plays on instruments of recovered material and is called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary names "Landing Harmonic" (harmonic garbage dump) shows the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">Around one billion tonnes of rubbish every year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and of him are the poorest - like people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with his inspirational acting game from rubbish-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra even played his music before Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These Eastern African countries show how technology and team work can fight the illegal fishing industry</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo Â© FISH-i Africa - a project that the wild illegal fishing is fought.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that targeted solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The re-publication happens in the context of an agreement with Global Voices for joint use of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, it was known that this ship had already been operated in limatory barrels of illegal fishing boats before reaching the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">According to the Eastern African countries, the East African countries were correspondingly frozen and inclined to a scary of the law of this kind to their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the comodors, Mozambique and Seychelles mobilised rapidly against the ship. they refused to have one of their harbors and refuses to share a fishing village.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "the Premier is surrounded by countries who simply refused everything to refuse," "" "reminds us of Kiilu, a executive employee of the Kenyan Fisheries Authority. it is part of a team that discovered the ship and persecuted." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013 the ship was expelled from the waters of the region: it wasn't enough to catch the fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Finally, it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars on Liberia, due to pillaging the country's fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative to cross the criminal practices and resources, FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NRO stop illegal Fishing (Illegal fishery).</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar for six countries that had expelled the Premier from their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">In this way, we have eight countries that are conspinning and working together. they are talking about where to work illegally fisheries, "says Tony Long, Head of the Pew Charitable Trusts Project Ending illegally Fishing. this project features FISH-i technical support.</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated: what is being caught, is hidden, but because of it is extremely difficult to split up, the illegal fishing is a main cause of overfishing regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">Because of the deliberate failure of existing laws, which should be protected by means of certain habitats and types, the illegal fishing ecosystems will harm an equilibrium.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while action against illegal fishing was once handicapped by bureaucratic hurdles and also through the snail entail, with the information between individual countries, so the actions nowadays occur in real time, with traceable on FISH-i's digital communications platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There can exchange the individual countries such as lists of existing licenses, news to suspect activities or details that could be noticed or experienced during an harbour inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very attentively when they move on the open sea, via satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows to mark the authorities to mark ships that find in forbidden areas - about such a suspects think that a ship will load his caught fish on other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fishing licence, where they were on the way and possibly even if they have a criminal offence.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing, can be refused on the basis of these information to accept such vessels in their harbours. what means that the ships can't sell their charge, so that they could even be forced to pay for penalties, as in the case of Premier.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "it goes by significant financial losses for the owners, meaning that the illegal fishing catch is not financially worthwhile." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">And that is what we want to achieve, "says Per Erik Bergh, executive director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consultant responsible for fighting illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created, at an estimated $20 million in lost turnover, which the eight members of the HISH-i network lose every year due to illegal fishermen who penetrate them in East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna-fish breweries that attracts the commercial fishing industry from all over the world. under these also, illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">Their practices include actions like the sailing under false flag, fake license papers, specials by phantasienamen, fish protected species and the fish in nature areas.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "" "" "take advantage of the missing international cooperation and make the weaknesses of a non-consistent control system." "" "says Long." "" "earlier, a ship was illegal and a country could say 'You could not run my port." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say 'Comm to me'. "and just this legale hatch tries to close FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="125">The closed front ends.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i was involved in more than 30 studies of suspects.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has revealed criminal networks, who had fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used multiple fraudulent identities and found it out of volatile ships and found it.</seg>
<seg id="128">Based on its collaboration with INTERPOL, the international authority for combating crimes, FISH-i can share information on illegal fishing over great distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "" "" "some of our investigations lead us fairly wide in the networks of organizing crime," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">It builds a system that should help FISH-i, suspects ships more precise.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system that will always be further developed, also helps to hide illegal ships.</seg>
<seg id="133">The illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position. "says Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, einer NRO, which deals with fisheries data and fISH-i technical support.</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships turn off, for example, the automatic identification systems due to which it cannot be created by satellite.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Copeland is therefore helping to build a system that combines various information levels. it should help FISH-i help to find criminal ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team of African Nations can actually take effect on the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, president of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently the SkyTruth has opened its platform Global Fishing Watch with Google and the Oceanic organization Oceana: a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed worldwide by means of each individual traceable ship worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "to gather together with the neighbours to get a better picture of it," "" "says he." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and bring their resources to study." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this on global level." "" "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project to run on which a global system started persecution of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There is signs that FISH-i's activities not only feel criminals but they are also screams.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that had previously exploited the earlier without license and can hardly be reckoned with consequences, knowing that they are observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i countries have meanwhile increased a 33% increase in fisheries, since then fishing boats buy more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia had helped Greko 1 doors found the inspectors there on board towing nets, whose use is prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">Other countries also notice these successes. "the effect is so powerful that us now also copy other countries," says Kiilu. "we have become a study project." in West Africa, several hundred million dollars disappear by illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="148">In 2015, six countries joined the West Africa Task Force to the so-called West Africa Task Force. furthermore, it is the goal of leaving more such initiatives and structures in other regions, "says Copeland.</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's latest member of Somalia was able to report his first big triumph: in October, there was Greko 1, a ship that went on a false flag. and not only the ship was used, towing nets were used, which are now forbidden.</seg>
<seg id="150">The ship was still booked in forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia. "" "" take a strong sign for fishermen "" "" against Greko 1. "" "" says Bergh. "" "</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time the evidence that such a special, collaborative work to protect the oceans actually works in the entire world.

<seg id="153">The road movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They are considered to be a protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum of the President NicolÃ¡s Maduro.</seg>

<seg id="160">The political and economic situation of the country deteriorates continuously, which is noticeable in everyday life in the life of Venice by an acute shortage of food and medicines.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the opposition saw the chance of a fundamental change in the official President of NicolÃ¡s Maduro, but ultimately the posture of a re-election was blocked by the official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne DÃ­az, co-acting during the Global Voices in Venezuela, summarizes the context of the Government statement as follows:</seg>
<seg id="163">As part of the social, political and economic crisis, in which the inflation rate of inflation was estimated at 500% (the inflation rate is estimated to be for many as the only way to return to the country to withdraw his institutional structures and to conclude a new government alliance.</seg>

<seg id="226">On the military base I had to destroy papers that had listened to the prisoners.</seg>

<seg id="230">My father took me four times after La Perla with everything in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">During the first time and during the last time he left me at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">When he took me the second time, he ordered me to go out. he led me to a barrack, in the cars, furniture, television, refrigerators - just everything possible.</seg>
<seg id="233">All of it was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">He gave me a little into a blanket, and ordered me to wear it. when I opened it, I saw that a large clump of silver was located.</seg>
<seg id="235">On that day I went to the other end of the Barracks where the stolen objects were completed and undertook me with a guard.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he interpreted to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">The prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">I saw in and saw a song, tortured on humans.</seg>
<seg id="239">It looked like a field bed and metal springs.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that it fortified the end of an cable. the other end was fixed by the body of the person who was right there.</seg>
<seg id="241">They took a man with hands on the bed, poured him with water and pursued a load of 220 volts to the genitalia.</seg>

<seg id="244">Years later, when my father stood under house arrest, the same odour came out of his room.</seg>
<seg id="245">I knew the smell immediately and I became clear that the smell of a body is in need.</seg>
<seg id="246">I never was able to forget this smell.</seg>
<seg id="247">And I asked myself: how is it possible to make a man so much harm?</seg>

<seg id="251">In the background, I saw a number of mattresses, on which naked people were filled with the face down - all were fastened at hands and feet.</seg>

<seg id="264">Here their names were changed, and they were assigned a number in the process of deactivating one number.</seg>
<seg id="265">When torture survived torture, the detainees were thrown into the cuadra until the arrangement of above came that they should be relocated.</seg>
<seg id="266">This was the lie - the euphemism - for the shooting of people and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases.</seg>
<seg id="267">The 'warfare'</seg>

<seg id="269">At that time, I had no idea what the "warfare" - as they called it - was.</seg>
<seg id="270">But when I was even when I was the military, I was in the Gendarmerie - I became clear that warfare is a bayonet or possibly military police, which one has fought against an enemy.</seg>

<seg id="273">But if you enter into a house and the refrigerator, the record players, clothes, paintings, money... stive, then does not have any degree of war but vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="274">That is theft.</seg>
<seg id="275">I always asked me how my father, the head of security forces, could bring with this vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="276">I don't understand it.</seg>
<seg id="277">I was also an officer in the Gendarmerie and I would never like to enter into an house and steal all in it.</seg>
<seg id="278">I don't understand how my father could do this.</seg>
<seg id="279">Once he called me a crime and I answered: and you, who rode cars on the road?</seg>
<seg id="280">You are no crime?</seg>
<seg id="281">He exploded before rage, struck me and cried:</seg>
<seg id="282">If you go so far, I will find you and refresh you.</seg>

<seg id="287">We were not poor, but he still brought clothes with home.</seg>
<seg id="288">At that time, the defence accused me to have been a fellow soldier in this crime. I answered, no problem, they can set me to load what they wanted.</seg>

<seg id="299">I always turned the question: they were tortured, but why were they killed?</seg>
<seg id="300">You could simply have to put it into prison.</seg>
<seg id="301">I guess, it was simply decided to kill these people. but why does their bodies disappear?</seg>

<seg id="331">He was found guilty of crimes against humanity for crimes against humanity. the Tribunal sentenced in 28 cases lifelong penalties and nine cases of adhesion between 2 and 14 years. in six cases there were acquittals.</seg>

<seg id="347">In the Japanese town of Kyoto, customers of a newly opened centre in which one can extend his Driverlicence, in the last month witnesses of a very special translation.</seg>
<seg id="348">In a sign the Japanese word (codile from sha), which means "older drivers" means, perhaps - but perhaps also with evil backgrounds, # 8212; as "terrible drivers" was translated.</seg>
<seg id="349">The wrong translation took place from 1st to 20th September on electronic advertisements in the entrance and the building itself.</seg>
<seg id="350">Adaptation of the original photos of Joshua Levine, which was dealt multiple in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The error was charged with the translator Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyotos. he was also aware of the local newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="352">The daily Kyoto Shimbun published in Kyoto.</seg>
<seg id="353">"how could it come to an English translation?</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation.</seg>
<seg id="355">This is an accusation for older people and in an international city such as Kyoto simply unacceptable, "said Holmes.</seg>
<seg id="356">"" "the defective English translation was first removed. the name" "" "" "" "(German:" "" "terrible drivers" "" ") was later replaced by the appropriate title" "" "Elder drivers" "" "(German:" "" "older drivers" "" ")." ""</seg>
<seg id="357">The police prefecture for the Kyoto prefecture. however, she explained that the error was already in the text which they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for their correctness before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported like this:</seg>
<seg id="359">"" "" "" "we are sorry that older people are insulted by the inadequate correction (the translation)," "" "said the police." ""</seg>
<seg id="360">Japanese online news service J-Cast News sat with the phenomenon of the "fearable" older motorists in Japan apart and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">The word "terrible" was denied as an unreasonable description of older motorists. according to the police, the proportion of older drivers who are involved in accidents are involved, but quite a reason to worry.</seg>
<seg id="362">In the Kyoto Prefecture, for example, 1,941 of a total of 19,460 accidents were caused by senior citizens in 2005. this corresponds to a share of 10%.</seg>
<seg id="363">Ten years later, in 2014, Seniors donated 1,803 from a total of 11.850 accidents.</seg>
<seg id="364">Thus, their share increased to 17.7%.</seg>
<seg id="365">While the number of accidents has fallen in total, the proportion of seniors caused by senior citizens in the same period increased.</seg>
<seg id="366">The name not mentioned reporter in the published version of the article comments on the light that show the advantages of some Japanese apparent against older drivers:</seg>
<seg id="367">The article on Yahoo on translation defects received the following comments:</seg>

<seg id="369">"" "" "" "so the translation is not at all, isn't it?" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="375">Photo of Flickr-users Andrew.</seg>
<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">You need two important skills: passive voice knowledge to understand the output text and active language skills to transfer it into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active master of the target language - something that is in native speakers in case. in general, the conviction applies that translators in the target language - not in the output language - speakers should be.</seg>
<seg id="379">So, a French native language should translate from English to French - not from French to English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr-User Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ workers with English as the mother tongue that might have translations into English. this may be missing to lack of terms, cost reasons, or the relatively small number of English speakers that may learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies that have self-employed translation have no foreign staff. then the Japanese company, whose English knowledge is considered to be the best one, for translators - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr-User Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translation are also widespread - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The worrens and encaptive propositions which are made by mechanical translations, show that this technique is still unable to replace human translators. this applies to some languages for a few languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest English formulation in Japan, including those that are often used T-shirts or bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or understood even though.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo of Flickr-users Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors like jewelry still acceptable or at least harmless. but by major companies or from the government that have funds to ensure greater standards can be expected to expect more carefully.</seg>
<seg id="389">The city of Kyoto uses a serious source of their translations in the future.</seg>
<seg id="390">Venezuela: protests and media measures on the Internet and Television</seg>
<seg id="391">The main page of the portal "Navegar con Libertad" (free surfing) of IPYS (Instituto PRENSA y Sociedad, Institute of Press and Society).</seg>
<seg id="392">On Friday morning, 7 April, venezolian Internet users, that they had no access to the online transmitter Vivoplay.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later other users wrote that the Internet recording of VPITV and El Capitolio TV did not be accessible anymore.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online transmitters also contributed to the recordings of the protests in Caracas, which were organized by oppositional groups, who resisted the NicolÃ¡s Maduros by the government.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests began in early April, after the Supreme Court dissolved the parliament and transferred the duties of the Parliament to the executive and the Supreme Court itself.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos DÃ­az, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a traceroutes. he pointed out that the connection is glued and receiving the usern, VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="397"># Censorship: activates your VPN.</seg>
<seg id="398">It seems that Internet pages of venezolish provider are again closed.</seg>
<seg id="399">That is from the site of @ VivoPlayNet.</seg>
<seg id="400">Offers such as Vivoplay are popular in veneers with Internet access, especially in times of unrest.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media have been on the reporting period since 2014. at that time, the Commission threatened to report on telecommunication with fines and closure, if they continue to report about demonstrations, as the Commission saw this as a "Declaration on violence."</seg>
<seg id="402">Without cable TV and informative national TV channels, I signed again at @ vivoplaynet.</seg>
<seg id="403">Astonishing that it is cheaper than to buy two litres of limonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO Co-filtro confirmed that not only Vivoplay is unaccessible through a blocking of the domain name system (DNS) but also two further online transmitter. this also applies to the website where the National Assembly transfers its sessions.</seg>
<seg id="405">Earlier follow-up of the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, showing that the local Internet providers are able to use DNS. this is a technology that answer the DNS server requests concerning certain domains.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a website has been blocked by DNS, the server answers incorrect or denied the inquiry to call such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS-lock: @ elolicotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">On VPITV, a third persibly channel, the transfer was set on Thursday, April 6, when the VPITV-Cameramann Elvis Flores, who was transferred live in Caracas, was put into custody.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was defeated, whilst he was in police custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">He was released eight hours later, and VPITV went on show again.</seg>
<seg id="411">Even though some channels are still accessible via YouTube, it has also been reported that the government is regulated by the government: thus the Venzolanians will always be worth the access to multi media coverage over the current events in the country.</seg>

<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived eight years in a household in which she did not eat along with the family that lived there.</seg>

<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she was ten years old she began to work as Criadita in Paraguay more than 46,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to work at school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The shop is very simple: a big family with little money transfer her minded son or her minderyear old daughter to another, abundant family. in exchange the child will receive food, a training and a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">However, what is not mentioned above, the children must pay for countless days of housework that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse may not be raised - and all that is in the framework of a contract that cannot lift up.</seg>
<seg id="425">This referred to as Criadazgo Practice is widespread in Paraguay according to the participation and acceptance by major parts of the society and despite abundant complaints from human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After completing her studies, Alvarenga worked for an organization that fought for the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with Criaditas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Criadazgo - collected testimonies, calculated and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to name things in the name, because the feeling of gratitude that is implied with crimity is guaranteed in general standstill.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvardena.</seg>
<seg id="430">On the other hand, the family, who has her daughter in the faith that they will improve their training in society and can do something out of itself, "to another family."</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family is dedicated to the girls and whose exploitation is justified with faith, that they would give someone an opportunity to get someone else and maybe even is hungry.</seg>

<seg id="436">When Carolina MarÃ­n came to the hospital in CaÃ±azaet, her body showed no more violent impacts. shortly afterwards she died.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">She was Criadita in the budget of the former Military Tribunal of TomÃ¡s Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as civil servants at the registration office.</seg>
<seg id="439">MarÃ­n lived with them in their home in VaquerÃ­a, a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital AsunciÃ³n.</seg>
<seg id="440">By the end of January 2016, Ferreira allegedly killed as long as with a stick to MarÃ­n, until they suffered deadly injuries.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">A few days later, the media reported on the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They decided that the murdered child was a Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations such as UNICEF or Callescuela made the deep in the paraguan Society of Criadazgo for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">It recorded the Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">"" "several dozen people came to protest violence together and demanded that there was" "" "no other Carolina" "" "in Paraguay." ""</seg>
<seg id="447">The name of the girl and photos were widespread in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay more cows are registered as children," mourned Tina Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="449">Without papers, it is much easier to violate the rights of children.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents it is very difficult to control, among which conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbours of the spouses and nearly 60 civil society organisations demanded an asterous analysis of the Falls.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want that TomÃ¡s Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo for the murder of the girl who was sentenced to 30 years in prison.</seg>

<seg id="454">The everyday life of a Criadita</seg>
<seg id="455">Criaditas are not only exploited as working forces but they are insulated by other girls in their old age.</seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farmers that her father worked, bankruptcy had to register and lost his father's work.</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers had to work all work and started to sell on the street or on the market sweets to earn money.</seg>
<seg id="458">They all went on to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent as Criadita to the capital Asuncion.</seg>
<seg id="460">In the house of their employer, Alvarenga worked between four and six hours each day.</seg>
<seg id="461">During this time, they had to share the time so that you still remained time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">She arose every morning at five o'clock and prepared breakfast for their employer.</seg>
<seg id="463">Friday, for example, clever the fridge, plaster the living room, polished the furniture and desperation of the ground.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was at the end, she went home again and had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="465">The more time it was done with learning, the more free time had her.</seg>

<seg id="500">Image of Pixabay, modified by Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="501">Published under the Public Domain CC0.</seg>
<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian parliamentary elections recently ordered a bill to "regulate the regulatory and user of social networks."</seg>
<seg id="503">If he is accepted by Parliament, users must register social media in Egypt at a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="504">On the basis of the law, then a place would be set up to use citizen and citizens to share social media.</seg>
<seg id="505">Within six months, with the assumption of the law, users would have to register and registered users on the site of the site with their correct names and staff numbers to use social networks.</seg>
<seg id="506">If it be missed to do this, this could bring a penalty of up to six months or a fine of money.</seg>
<seg id="507">The bill, consisting of six paragraphs, and in local media, including Youm7 and Egypt is Independent, defines social media as "jedwede Application, which runs over the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice, video setup and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law is set if it is assumed, since the draft cannot place, such as Egyptian authorities must lay down the user, not in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is not able to ensure the regulation on the level of social media companies.</seg>
<seg id="509">Riyad Abdul Sattar, member of the parliamentary elections, related to the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users and users received a user name and a password to come through the firewall which blocks Facebook. "</seg>
<seg id="510">This could mean that Egypt is planning to establish a firewall on national level around Facebook. due to them, it would be necessary to submit information on its identity to access the network.</seg>
<seg id="511">But it is not known so far that such plans exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts and experts on site are skeptical about the technical feasibility of the forefront.</seg>
<seg id="513">Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technological (") of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, in German" Egyptian initiative for personal rights "), told Global Voices:</seg>
<seg id="514">I doubt the technical capacity and the understanding of the neither authority in Egypt concerning things that have to do with technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">According to my opinion it is so that same as they are violent on physical public and private premises, it could also be done online.</seg>
<seg id="516">If I feed them, then this means that they will apply a powerful surveillance system to apply for citizens who want to apply a permit or not. and this means a crazy system to monitor the activities of the people and to carry out a judicial process.</seg>
<seg id="517">That's technically impossible to realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="518">In order to be passed by the law, the draft must first be discussed at the legislature of Parliament and the Constitutional Court before it enters into the debate.</seg>
<seg id="519">Whether its assumption and implementation will be successful or not, the draft "stands in line with a pro-military thinking in the Parliament, whose senses will be maximized and ensured that no deviating anew is present on the image area," says Raoof.</seg>
<seg id="520">Last year, Tamer El-Shahawy suggested a bill of law against Cyber Crime, who was to be found guilty of life imprisonment for those who are to threaten to threaten the "public order" and "to protest."</seg>

<seg id="544">In early March 2017, the daily Kahoku Shvacco, the progress made in the North-East Japan, have been forced to rebuild the life of those in the last six years. a great earthquake, a tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima joined the catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="545">Kahoku Shvacco Newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, in the Prefecture of Miyagi, the prefecture of Miyagi was one of the prefectures in Japan's Northeast, which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring prunectures Fukushima and Iwate were forced displaced, because the tsunami had disappear whole coastal cities from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">In addition, the prefecture of Fukushima still experienced a nuclear accident, already alone, 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their houses.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of Kahoku Shvacco shows a local point of view that progress has been achieved six years later in order to rebuild the life of local authorities.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics of the Japanese reconstructions and the survey results of the affected themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The housing plant in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwata</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shvacco Newspaper reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned spare parts (in the set), saigai kouei juutaku, were completed in the prefectures of Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi could be the largest success among the three prefectures, with 80 percent of the planned spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima still forms the final light with 70 percent.</seg>
<seg id="554">There are still six years after the catastrophe, evacuated by Behefswald, which had evacuated evacuated from Behavixjuuutaku in the final spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the three times catastrophe, nearly 80 000 people saw themselves forced to live in Beheform.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016 still 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate lived in such containers.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of the Fukushima living in 2011 still lived in notions, whereas Miyagi was successful. more than 75 percent of the evacuated, which were sheltered after the disaster in accommodation houses, were settled in final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate the figure is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The status of works and everyday life in the three concerned prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">As the Kahoku Shvacco Newspaper was able to have discovered 1074 from 1100 schools that were affected by evil until December 2016, which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, the industrial reconstruction of the three prefectures is far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While nearly 100 percent of the fishing ports in Iwate and Miyagi have now been in operation, only 30 percent of the fishing ports have been re-commissioned in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and nuclear accident, have moved in the three prefectures of agricultural land in large-area.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi could recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas, whereby only 66 percent of the farmland in Iwate and less than 50 percent of the farmland in Fukushima can be used again.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that only a sequence of atomic fact is, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed farmland of Fukushima are located in the nuclear zone of nuclear zone. "</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered continuously, but again the Fukushima still remains far back.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist figures in Miyagi and Iwate are up to 90 percent of the same stand as before the misfortune. Fukushima still can only have 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shvacco Newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants, it is more difficult to earn their livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">To determine a total image, the newspaper introduced numerous surveys under the native population and among the evacuated people. she asked them about the state of restart and also, as their indignation has changed towards the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction of the article the Kahoku Shvacco Newspaper explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shvacco led a survey to bring more about the tsunami consciousness among the local population in experience.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey carried out that 83.1 percent of local residents, measures were taken in order to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of respondents say that still not enough in danger of disasters.</seg>
<seg id="575">How it stands out to be evacuated from the prefecture of Fukushima</seg>
<seg id="576">In its issue on the anniversary of the earthquake, Kahoku Shvacco Zeitung has strengthened its attention on the situation of evacuated Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima still had to experience the massive earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, the prefecture of Fukushima was also witness of the worst, catastrophes, atomic fact that Japan had ever experienced.</seg>
<seg id="578">Of 160 000 evacuated from Fukushima, nearly 63 000 people were displaced in areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016, there were more than 23 000 people, back to Fukushima, in permanent spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="580">After 2017, there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima living outside their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the disaster areas, most of the evacuated areas are still alive, older than 50 years old. you have to come in proper container, because the efforts to rebuild Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima still have to compete with massive construction projects. this is about construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games, which will be held in Tokyo in 2020.</seg>

<seg id="595">A Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered this week to the intensive care unit: last Friday, a police officer had defeated at GoiÃ¢nia at a demonstration in GoiÃ¢nia around a protest against austerity.</seg>
<seg id="596">Mateus Ferreira da Silva, studied social sciences at the Federal University of GoiÃ¡s, suffered a skull-brain trauma and several fragments.</seg>
<seg id="597">Doctors operated him on Saturday, and now put it into an artificial Coma.</seg>
<seg id="598">His condition is considered critical.</seg>
<seg id="599">The local photo journalist Luiz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mateus which spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days.</seg>
<seg id="600">On the pictures is also the face of the police officer, which was identified with a strike. the man was identified as Augusto Sampaio.</seg>
<seg id="601">After the incident, the military police announced in the Brazilian state of GoiÃ¡s that Sampaio had been suspended until the end of the investigation of the active service.</seg>
<seg id="602">The images show the police officer, as he proposes in GoiÃ¢nia with his impact on the face of the student Mateus Ferreira (photos: Luiz da Luz).</seg>
<seg id="603">Would be a police officer of a demonstrators and on the intensive care unit, his face would be visible for six months in television and the entire repression would be justified.</seg>
<seg id="604">The Facebook page "Desolalizador," a press channel of media activists from GoiÃ¢nia, divided by Luiz da Luz, divided by Luiz da Luz, where you can see how Mateus is attacked by the police officer and several sanitary short on it.</seg>
<seg id="605">Another video with the same scenes, but from a different perspective, is also immersed in the social networks.</seg>
<seg id="606">In the below shown clip you can see the attack on Mateus down the 50th second.</seg>
<seg id="607">For Mateus family, who lives in another state, Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazilian reais (about 2,700 Euros) to cover a part of the costs for medical treatment and to stay in GoiÃ¢nia during the hospital.</seg>

<seg id="612">On Facebook, Professor Pablo Ortellado calls for further nonviolence against activist in GoiÃ¡s.</seg>
<seg id="613">GoiÃ¡s experienced a wave of political power: here was the activist Guilherme Irish from his father, because he had attacked the Occupy Movement in secondary schools, and now we have attacked the very sad case of Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who has been attacked by a policemen who struck him with a strike in the face.</seg>
<seg id="614">Police transmissions</seg>
<seg id="615">GoiÃ¡s was not the only state in Brazil where it came to the most brutal police operations against demonstrators last Friday.</seg>
<seg id="616">Police officers set up a stage in protests at the centre of Rio de Janeiro, where demonstrators had built a stage for speakers, Gummigrade and TrÃ¤nengas.</seg>
<seg id="617">The deputies of Flavio Serafini, social and peace-party leaders (PSOL), asking the police to renounce violence against demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="618">This also includes a report in Folha de S. Paulo, one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="619">Once again the Brazilian media protrudes, by changing the focus on another, unexpected protagonists: a window plate.</seg>
<seg id="620">The Folha de S. Paulo and estado de S. Paulo reported specifically about a crushed glass windows to create a photo of their title pages.</seg>
<seg id="621">In contrast, the O Globo preferred a title story with a set of fire.</seg>
<seg id="622">There is no plausible journalistic reason, more about a broken window plate than the protests among thousands of people who serve the defense of a special thing.</seg>
<seg id="623">This must also be seen if you strive against any form of atomic damage.</seg>
<seg id="624">Too, the term "Vandalism" will also receive a absurd, undisproporish significance, and the typical violence of the military police are committed through headlines with the title "demonstrators on confrontation course with the police."</seg>
<seg id="625">The Lost Villages to Cuba out of the Abindustralization in Cuba</seg>
<seg id="626">With the introduction of the Act of Ãlvaro Reynoso, nearly hundreds of sugar cane factories were opened to the doors of Cuba (Photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The parish church Gregorio ArleÃ© MaÃ±alich, located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is commonly known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill, regardless of that there is no significant sugar-harvest on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years ago when the activities were mapped into the sugar cane factories.</seg>
<seg id="629">After the earth, the sugarcane industry stood still in the region, and the factory was lost after and after its installations until only the rumours of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to be reinvaded.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changes the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Other resigned and commutes a day to the factories which are still mapped.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a Soldier veteran, open every day at 4: 00 in the morning, the crisis in the sugar pipe industry does not seize his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that it works in the eastern part of the sugar cane factories which are reactive after long inactive days, because they have been preserved.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something that he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene reminds us that in MaÃ±alich the sugar cane Factory would be preserved, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar industry resistance have already the plagues, the case of socialism, the low market prices, the Inefficking, the bad administrative decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016 the production was 1.6 million tonnes of sugar, less than the year 1910 produced.</seg>
<seg id="639">The news would have been a motive for the country before a few decades, but the bad harvest has already been no novelty more.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar industry switched off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway station of the community saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction in the sugar industry sectors was an economical need: the 155 sugar tubes mills were technically obsolete, and hardly competitive for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to focus the production on the most efficient factories, the annual production rate was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They only left the factories that can produce sugar for the most 4 Centavos (0,03 euros).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motifs that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar tubplants and the power crisis on the global market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless the sugar price increased from about one decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 until 2025, the price of unrefined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the report published by the OECD and FAO, Agriculture and Nutrition organisation of the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar cane would generate roughly $85 million for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not all ran well</seg>
<seg id="652">"today the day is going to enter with safety in history," these were the first words of the Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lavandero.</seg>
<seg id="653">From there, the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years the disclosure of a total of 98 sugar tubes factories, more than 65 million people received their full salaries for further training.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the Gregorian tube factory Gregorian o ArlÃ©e MaÃ±alich on 14 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto PÃ©rez worked in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">If Nene is known as a soldier, talking about the closure of the factory, the word that he repeated most repeatedly, "Scam."</seg>
<seg id="658">Nearly all respondents say: not one of them was informed that the factory would shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order to obtain the place, they were a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">In front of the first semester, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was officially unwritten documents, which would only be found regarding the parts that would be removed, the address of the address and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulja Rosales del Toro, only the Minister for withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From there the responsibility was over and the letters were always more common.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the lactate factory for two years and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money, that he was still in operation.</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years, waits for the retirement in another plant, Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was against his will in the standings of the factory, whose construction he helped.</seg>
<seg id="667">With each part he removed, he disassembled from one of his 31 years of work.</seg>
<seg id="668">The best developed industrial sector of Cuba and the most important workpieces has been deleted.</seg>
<seg id="669">In many cases, there were no alternatives to work stations and services that were generated in the municipalities in which they were found.</seg>
<seg id="670">We will never know if during the mammoth speech of October 21, 2002, the former president in the eyes of the present people saw that factories were not working for the areas whose factories were not working for five years, everything would run well.</seg>
<seg id="671">The price of the population for the closure of the sugar tubes factories</seg>
<seg id="672">Sugar cane has been extracted only high by grinding.</seg>
<seg id="673">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="674">After two years the parish church Gregorio ArleÃ© MaÃ±alich learned that many things changed, but not always to better when a factory is closed.</seg>
<seg id="675">When the sugar cane factory was closed, or better, when they began to beat them, they also listened to the asphalt road, they also listens to others.</seg>
<seg id="676">Without work in the region, and with advanced age, Nene and Eddy had to search other factories.</seg>

<seg id="692">Youths of the first Nations communities in Canada have the subject to deal with topics, which are important for them. do they do with Hip-Hop, thanks to a number of walking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">Since 2014, as part of the N'we Jinan-tour, mobile recording studios can accommodate direct schools and youth centres to provide youth groups Songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live appearances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by the Pedagogues David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and in North Quebec with ten crew communities and then worked together with the Cree Hip Hop Group The NorthStars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop gets that the young participates in conversations issues such as "cultural identity, language, meditation, love, self-acceptable" or whatever is to be found in mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos, where the youngsters are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia, and was invited to organize similar workshops with the strain of Winunevago in the US state of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo in the field of the tribe of the Kitsumkalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, called Highway 16, also called "Highway of tears," in which nearly two dozen usually indigenous young women have disappeared or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were not resolved.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemhi Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video player to mediate, as important to the preservation of traditional customs and customs, despite the influences of globalization.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the young people do not always rule the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song we recorded the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation, the refrain will be sung in Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young participated in this young people got some help from Gary Jolly by the Northstars Hip-Hop Group which gave them a Strophe in the dialect Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">At the Facebookside of N'we Jinan, the strophe is available in the address, also an translation into English, which is translated here:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel when no one would be interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I'm trying to go on the earth my days</seg>
<seg id="707">That is the day when you will take our scream</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will raise us a day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">So they can grow and lead the same as our youth</seg>
<seg id="712">So you can do it, what they are the Creator for?</seg>
<seg id="713">In the commentary part, the reader and supporter of Cree-language Kevin Brousseau also adds a contribution and adds the strophe in a silo (which is also published on his blog and published here with permission):</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan one can see almost any restaurant of plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers, what exactly on the menu bar will be found in the proximity of the entrance-okuhin sanpuru (located in the set, "Plastic models of dishes") from any food that will be served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers see this plastic putted and decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the production of this plastic.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the Tappabashi district of Kappabashi there is a multitude of these small enterprises that produce those plasters, which the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese, these plastic dishes are so commonly that they don't get them all. a new trend, however, is now transformed into normal mobile accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver Matome, the blogger itinii published a series of social media links and photos, which show this unusual twist with the shocuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new with plastic covered mobile phone bands, as shown in Kichijoi Tokyu Kaufhaus.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods were turned to kitschigen collecting objects, as in this case, refrigeratormagnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are some Shocous refrigeratormagnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom of the Essennines shall become increasingly walled.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case, an kaans-don (a popular travel dish with seafood) has been transformed into a mobile phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as cell phone support.</seg>
<seg id="731">We have also produced this part for the Tokyo exhibition in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple, keeping your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And this is just the beginning of an increasing flight to the Comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile phone support and mobile designers allow you to produce your own artwork. in this case, ikura or salmon was used, a popular topping with white rice is served.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">Is there someone who say: "Wow, cool, now I can manipulate my mobile phone with laughter?."</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic grilled can also accept a less appetite form to surprise visitors or family members unpleasant.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile phone stand has the shape of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also Reisballs (onigiri), earrings and hand straps made of dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">Further skarrile plastic sketches can be seen in: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter to the hashtag # 1950.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you want to know more about the origin of this trends, then this video gives you an insight into the district of Kappabashi, which is dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry. like for example with the shocuhin sanpuru.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports in- and foreign media about the infamous "struggle against the drugs," in Mexico, the missilences and the tumours regularly appear only in statistics. however, this reflected not the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle with themselves.</seg>
<seg id="750">The coverage of the drug law as El Chapo GuzmÃ¡n, the chief of the Sinaloa cartells, urged the stories of the victims of conflict perfect in the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">The day after a violent incident looks hardly any person on the funeral or to those who have learned to live with pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">There are behind any loan, behind each bone refunds in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories paying parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners, their wounds maybe never heal.</seg>
<seg id="753">That is why the Mexican News portal Animal PolÃ­tico has called the digital project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "with the drug trading,") to give these victims a voice and told stories of people who were in the struggle between the prosecution authorities and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal PolÃ­tico describes the project so:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organizing crimes against us not only fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The impact are a lot of profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, if shops close because they are threatened by drug dealers and all the congregations will have to drive many kilometers to buy some as milk.</seg>

<seg id="759">"" "a video with the title" "" "Vidas que cambian por el" "" "(German:" "" "as fears life") tells exactly these stories. "" "</seg>
<seg id="760">A main character is Guadalupe, a father, who searches every weekend secret graves after his son.</seg>

<seg id="771">It is the insurance of my Father, but they won't pay them out because they ask a death certificate.</seg>
<seg id="772">Where should we get that? "</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprender a vivir con el narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">We don't just need to show the faces of those who are afraid of fear. we must show the international community, the conflict, the fragility and the state control.</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reading of Animal PolÃ­tico, wrote this post from Taxco, in the State of Guerrero in Central Diko.</seg>
<seg id="778">Their contribution reminds us that violence should never be considered normal, no matter whether in which form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I've been familiar with illness and Sensational journalism now for some years.</seg>
<seg id="780">I pass at newspaper kiosken every day and see the cover page with pictures, which actually can only come from a textbook for criminology or from Akten of specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It takes me from the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I have the feeling, as if I am the incarnal, or sad. it acts as a lack of respect to the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be equal, or consider that this is normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it is not normal that my 10-year-old cousin wants to be great, if it's big. and it is not normal that people can hear about the "heroic deeds" of the offenders when they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me, when they were those who have lost someone who lost someone and those who have feared that they also happens something like that.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness, when stories become naked numbers in a statistic only.</seg>
<seg id="788">The facts on men is incredible for me when death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village may be justified that they were "wake-up."</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they are trying to talk that they are not spared by such tragedies, if they don't touch and still be silent.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution "Four months Repressing in the Capital distributions: as a family replundered as a family with drauctions. it describes how the armed criminals did not destroy money from their business, until they did not only destroy its business, but also their family are torn apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think all that you have lost and about how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain never goes, the grief remains, the anxiety comes up again, if you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers also.</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The more we are removed, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She completed her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">"" "" "" "we want to be arrested for the others, because you don't know when they will lead you or kill." ""</seg>
<seg id="798">I asked me in these terrible days, if there would be my deep roots feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot to do what you cries. I have to learn to live with pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">The journalist Mario GutiÃ©rrez Vega published the contribution "The Forgotten Children of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez: a generation of violence."</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he designs any questions regarding: who cares for the child of a missing wife and a man who was killed by organized crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexicos?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age whose parents take care of them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a fatherless and narrates that he makes himself a egg, cooked potatoes, tortillas, tortillas, and "Chichi" for the babies who live with him. this is his name for the preparation of flacons with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for the whole life of violence and who had to learn to live so.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, one told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day that his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was over two years before, when he was only a few blocks away from his home, the bloody dead bodies of his father, who had been shot by armed men from a preoccupied car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in JuÃ¡rez was seen as follows:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006, when violence through the organized crime and fighting against it, with the already existing social problems in JuÃ¡rez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010, JuÃ¡rez was the most vulnerable city in the world due to the number of murder on public security and government of the United States government.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the public prosecutor had 3103 Morde. this corresponds to an average of 8.5 Morden per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are only a few of thousands of stories that organized the organized crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Just a few stories live in view of the new headlines. but this project reminds us of those who are not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco," Narcodata project has launched the data journalism project, whose aim is to present the complex information behind the failed struggle against drugs, which has tortured the country in the last four decades, in a wise manner.</seg>

<seg id="823">But there are questions about our desire to get images to messages.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>

<seg id="842">Many were tender, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only on satellite images could be illustrated the folly time.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack was also unresolved, but the army-based war in Bagha was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerias and an attempt to win the Boko Haram, country (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture from the DR Kongo back again, as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack was presented:</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong topics or frames (flooding), which make this post navigation. the first frame is focusing on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used in terms of major discussions about silence in connection with the exhortation of Christians or the defense of Muslims - the exhortation of the Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second Framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is assessed compared to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">Religion understand and the value of human life is both important. therefore it is worth to examine how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">However, a deeper question is what happens if readers cannot give this pictures longer faith.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are only some people who unintended to exercise the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Sugarising this mood of missiles and falsehood, that actual atrocities are true and tastes the actual grass of what actually happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar in Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The spreading of forcible images was already debated in detail (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">A argument is that the retention of images of a refusal comes to recognize the tragedy. sometimes these pictures will even be required by the victims.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, care is that there are forcible pictures reader and spectators and give them the ability to feel empathy (such as this study, who visited how forcible media must work on it, others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there are many as many forcible representations in the news media, fact that it is indispensable for the current News report.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against "Fake News." they will be thoroughly thinking about the situation in which a picture can actually become a little sugary, but actually replaced by the context or in totally missile species.</seg>

<seg id="1132">We have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions according to the role of what my girlfriend and I think in the rain during the Women's March, because the occupation that we have had a new future, in which we had no president, the chocolate cake has bombed, goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion beyond.</seg>

<seg id="1136">Can there be a way, here and now in spite of any language barrier with someone else in connection?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, the founders of the Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS) is an answer to stories in their original language.</seg>
<seg id="1138">"" "Global Voices reported a" "" "Global Voices" "" "about a different initiative by Steven Bird, the unmistakable Blog." ""</seg>
<seg id="1139">However, the focus of TLS is not on the written word but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to maintain and proclaim the language variety of big cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">Indeed, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in Oakland, where TLS has already carried out events since 2015, the risk that small and not so small languages are not given to those born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">To the makers of the Project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the world may be avoided if we are able to accept cities - secure spaces in which residents must not forget to be eligible for.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "listening often is connected to understand" "" "these events instead," "" "listen to" "" "listen to feel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format history, history of history initially set their history in their own language, or explain it then to English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Although the participants are not a professional history of history, their commitment and their presentation will result in the hearing of the audiences.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call laughter and emotions out when the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">For example, the following video shows a traditional story from Burkina Faso, which is told in the language Dafing. during this round the history of history of Rassidatou Konate also takes the opportunity to explain the customs of customs of art.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyamusara tells the fuse of hasen and the Pavian in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">"" "after he explains the significance of his fencing, John Nyamusara asked," "" "how is that to talk to an audience who does not understand your language?" "" "with a wide grinsen, he divides his feeling of emotions:" ""</seg>
<seg id="1150">They have heard!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far, the events of the Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organizers hope to expand this. all who are inspired by the project can be informed with TLS in order to organize your own history of history.</seg>

<seg id="1157">The advocate of the reproof of debts have also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">The People of Puerto Ricos urges that the politicians, banks and government agencies who are responsible for the debt of responsibility for their corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1160">We call for a financial inspection and a Steering Committee without personal interests in public debt, with a fixed, our working conditions, corresponding to the economy.</seg>
<seg id="1161">We are pressed and suppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">The people of Puerto Ricos refuses to pay a debt, which is not their.</seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>
<seg id="1164">Our pensioners will not take up with sinking pension payments.</seg>
<seg id="1165">We require immediate action.</seg>

<seg id="1167">Hence the so-called "Centre for New Economy," an independent non-profit organization without party status with focus on socioeconomic development, a law to state responsibility, as an alternative to existing state view.</seg>
<seg id="1168">These are their reasons:</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syrian-Palestinian web developer Bassel Khartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi, has been missing since more than one year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and relatives have continued the campaign for his freedom and reminding the contributions which he has made for an open net.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: PUBLICA, which is held annually at the annual Conference for digital culture that will be held in Berlin, devoted an event to the # FreeBassel campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1186">MÃ©lanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist who is produced in France-based CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara RÃ¼hling, Managing Director of the book Cost of Freedom in three to five days, covers excerpts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Intranet (The cost of freedom: a collective research).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book written in the last year and is available here licensed, includes a series of essays that deal with free culture in the presence of the repression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a tribute to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction, it is:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book would like to learn how to build open knowledge and what are the true cost, with which this is connected.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors, who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked on page to view over the fog, which gives our newsfeeds to create something from our different experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to liberate Basketchil, beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer, who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was cancelled from the directory of the Adra prison that he sat on October 3, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then we have no information about his current state or of residence.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title Collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice to know his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom.</seg>
<seg id="1196">To see how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us will begin to think about their own destinies, deeds and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What have we chosen for us?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we abandoned in this process of temporary extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer of Open Source and digital activist has been in the Syrian government authorities since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military institution, to an unknown place.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer in Noura Ghazi reported that the "Military Police Bassel had taken the basis of a" strictly secret "command of the military court from his cell in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that she was contacted on 12 November 2015 by individuals who were committed himself as an insider the Assad government and having regard them by a alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">However, its position and condition remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a decisive role in incorporating the access to the internet and knowledge of the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist, and currently overlap the director of the New Palmyra, a project that formed the Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Bassels cultural prototypes were fostered as the work that he started with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually construct the ancient ruins of the Palmyras.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the crosscross of numerous civilians and here's Greek-Roman architectural types with hitherly traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">At that time, at that time, he could not know that ten years after working with this work, the IS would put everything, this architecture, not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens, but the world embodied.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This strip in the digital archaeology and the conservation has created a time capsule which will be open to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future of invaluable value.</seg>
<seg id="1211">In this way, Bassel was not able to close this project.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of their man to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my whole life to dream of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed if I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel brought me English, even when he was already in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read English well, to write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He always has his knowledge with everyone who has asked. he has taught other detention, English to read and speak.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened me the gate to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet at.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also brought other inges, as they use computers at least, at least theoretically, without having actually held one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a commission that she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015, when he was in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura have worked together in the book for a year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She sang the lyrics by him when she visited him and he translated them from the Arab to English.</seg>

<seg id="1227">Here an excerpt from the book of Nora titled "It is happening":</seg>
<seg id="1228">It happens during each visit,</seg>
<seg id="1229">I sing in the world of your enchanting eyes,</seg>
<seg id="1230">That I lose my mind in the moment, in which we embrace poor,</seg>
<seg id="1231">That each of the dangers is no matter,</seg>
<seg id="1232">Each of fences, boilers and guardians</seg>
<seg id="1233">I sang the prisons of the prison</seg>
<seg id="1234">And I turn to every detail of your voice and words.</seg>
<seg id="1235">What I carry with me with passion,</seg>
<seg id="1236">If thine eyes fail to say</seg>
<seg id="1237">And I leave another piece of my soul with you...</seg>
<seg id="1238">I return rapidly to my loneliness,</seg>
<seg id="1239">To get all the moments,</seg>
<seg id="1240">And to weep and to smile.</seg>
<seg id="1241">I testify to myself that I will return soon...</seg>
<seg id="1242">Ghazi wrote on the first anniversary of the arrest of Bashsel:</seg>
<seg id="1243">One year goes, my soul</seg>
<seg id="1244">During the</seg>

<seg id="1248">According to the 2011 protests against the regime Bashar al-Assets, the Syrian network for Human Rights (Syrian Network for Human Rights) have disappeared more than 65,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="1249">Those who were arrested or executed under violence through the regime were tortured or even executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">According to the International Human Rights Organisation Amnesty International since 2011, at least 17.723 Syrer died in detention since 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many other people are unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1252">Since 2012, the Global Voices Community calls for release Bassel.</seg>
<seg id="1253">Today we repeat our demand in hope that we have to do this for the last time.</seg>
<seg id="1254">Mozambique: infringement of corruption on pre-tax office due to corruption</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mozambique reacted with wrath on a corruption in which a government member returned to the workplace in the state apparatus by which the corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is the diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other defendants with four other defendants.</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds at the airports of Mozambique, whose Council Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 because of a good leadership and immediately called his re-setting into the company, which was then on 19 April.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the General Attorney of the Republic, which evaluated the request, there wouldn't be an obstacle for Cambaza, to return to his old post, as the company did not agree to discipline.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many residents do not use the action well.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Centre for Public integrity (Centro de Integridade PÃºblica, short CIP), a local institution which provides for public transparency, sentenced to an interview with the Deutsche Welle, decision to set the company's decision:</seg>
<seg id="1262">Represents a setback in the struggle against corruption and clarifies the lack of transparency and even a step in regard to the efforts of our legal system, the CIP.</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we estimate is that the company should have been creating a disciplinarction proceedings against the trailing list.</seg>
<seg id="1264">However, the company was silent, however, does not apply adequate legal steps to use the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">EgÃ­dio Vaz, a major voice in the Mosambique social media, rejects this behavior, and consider the case as "rebellious":</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza was a competent type, he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to prison and half of them had to eat half.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could hold lectures and motivating words, he could advise and shot his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he has accepted to reintegrate it into the company which he saved harm.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza is gladly paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Residue!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mosambience and Student of Political Science in Brazil, says the director no Moral:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza is rewarded by the state, because he won't beltted him that one has rewarded someone in such way that the state has already ended so massively.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza is missing the Moral and to serve the state, * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but has only served themselves in the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state to be a inexhaustible money source and the state itself is tired of being tired and finally was condemned to a long term of imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey ZeÃºte is preferred to remember the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Fel to remember that a thief has belonged to prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves include in the prison Samora Makel the Mozambique is not only staying for ever as the first independent president in memory, but also as a sharp, trimming and - Incidentally - Prophetic Redner.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous oral representations, when he was energetically confirmed that "an ambitious man should be able to be able to sell his own individual interest, to sell his own individual interest."</seg>
<seg id="1279">Samora also said: "I don't know if an ambitious man changes, my experience shows that it is not so. he changes the tactic, but he does not change his amitions.</seg>
<seg id="1280">An ambitious man is a crime "at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="1281">In Twitter the reactions were also disclosed:</seg>
<seg id="1282">Cambaza was sentenced to 22 years in prison, he sat down for 10 years and was free.</seg>
<seg id="1283">And today it sets him the company, in which he was a scholar, again under contract. # AssimVaiOMeuPais - for grates. (@ azmal _ Rafik), May 12, 2017</seg>

<seg id="1286">Facebook blocks the racist word "Kalar" in Myanmar and censored many users to wrong</seg>
<seg id="1287">The Burmese word "Kalar pae" signifies Kichererbach or Spacy.</seg>
<seg id="1288">Photo of Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported</seg>
<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their posters from the net, because they contained the word 'Kalar' abstained.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Even though the origin of the Word is still discussed, it is usually used to refer to people East Indian origin or in general as adjectively. "</seg>
<seg id="1291">Facebook licensed the word "Kalar" or the sexes (in Burmical lettering) as part of an initiative to tackle the far spread problem of the Hasslanguage in Burma in the social network.</seg>
<seg id="1292">Over the past few years, the ascension of radical nationalist movements has given an extremely disable Konnotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that mostly used by Ultra nationalists as hate Muslims, representing a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to fight them in Myanmar in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of sensible content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'mag is usually associated with racism, but the word is not automatically detected in Hasslanguage.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; lots of people have reported that, in which they have discussed the use of the word or have covered doubts for the use of the word.</seg>
<seg id="1297">In addition, there are several burial words with basic different meanings that have the same accounting sequence like 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, on Burmese also called 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters, as well as other words like 'Kalar pae' (coil), 'Kalar oat' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooky Aung Kaung Myat declared the various meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar':</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he had asked his friends on a spiritual way whether they could find out how he could linking his back pain, making a word game.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The sentence Ku la - "Healing" (Ku) + the Fractant (la) on Burmese - similar to the racist expression very, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were various reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Hd is the opinion that they will reduce the language of radical nationalists, but also emphasized that Facebook would be analytical to spread out all post, who spread in suspicion, racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook deletes the word "Kalar" not manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It automatically filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The Automism will not understand what you are writing on Facbeque.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What to do instead, is the post carefully to analyze and check it by reading the uneving words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae" (Spellbsen).</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good is that these three-piece nationalists who spread hate speech will receive a quite good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action is able to send a strong signal to all, the hate language may not stop the efficiency of this strategy.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China like Sina Weibo and Wechat have demonstrated that the censor's censorship often will start to start a new word or an alternative writing of censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described as Facebook began to clear his posts when he wanted to make his friends only that the word 'Kalar' was banned from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I was attentive to this new Directive of Facebook, I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the Word was closed.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post has been removed from Facebook and me, the liken, post and parts of content for 24 hours, because the Post has not promised "the Facebook community standards."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has a variety of postcards from people, who have no negative intentions, or those simply try to show their opinions against the Hassam radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his mail was removed, who has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech is removed from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post office, the author shared his opinion why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism are bad in the country.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook would have more should do before the start of the initiative, for example, the Burmese internet community asked advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook may have a well-wanted intention to reduce racism in Burma by their platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Such words are scanned only more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">It seems, as if they have begun to have this without local context or technical support, and so words as "chair" or "Assumcurry."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they made mistakes, they didn't try them to be retrieved.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they only have more respect for the 15 million benefits, they would like to find a large turnover, that would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks automated censorship has led to users among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Rather than take it, users can now have fun and write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate speech to see if their posters will be taken away from the net.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook Posts which were not abstained by Hasslanguage:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmese text is "I want to sit on a chair and watch your brosencurry and watch a Indian film.</seg>
<seg id="1332">Just to try out whether Facebook contains the post, which contains the word Kalar. "</seg>
<seg id="1333">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1334">The post states "If you are a doctor, healing then people?"</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In the last five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious treasure specialists have used social networks to expand their voices and its influence.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, it is intended to heat the violence in the municipalities in Myanmar, especially in the area of Rakhine, where disputes between Muslims and Buddhists have been forced to flee to escape.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook was told for his failure to give them the hated of them on his Burmese pages under control, criticises her.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But instead, rather than to read the word 'Kalar', it would have been better to concentrate on context than on code concentrating initiatives and learned of them.</seg>

<seg id="1348">In 2011, the Federal Statistical Office of the country confirmed that more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys under 19 were married.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements, which endeaved to abolish laws to the children's toe, followed by the base and rejoiced in large support. undoubtedly helped them to carry out this result.</seg>

<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition competed for stresses in this actually uncomplicated cause, and sometime in doubt whether the opposition would be at all at all.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But at the beginning of 2017, the bill was decided against the children of children - despite 4 Senators (including one woman) of the opposition and an independent, which abstained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him a law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now, only the President of the country must vote and let the law proclaim.</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the country's lowering of the country has been a status update which Leslie-Ann Boiselle again posted on Instagram:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill against children before it was approved in the House of Representatives with 35 votes against it and no one against them.</seg>
<seg id="1357">After having decided in the Senate, the draft version can now be implemented for the law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Most of the social media users were thrilled because the laws finally had been changed before it's finally.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook member Lovell Francis, which was a ministerial minister in the Ministry of Education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It has too much time and unnecessary Gerede, that has devoured the core of the thing, but do you know what? the ptoe is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago now, and that's nearly any prize.</seg>

<seg id="1375">But a possible hook comes in the form of Sat Maharaj, as Secretary General of the Sanatan, Maha Sabha, the most famous Hindu-Organization of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1376">Months ago, Maharaj announced his intention to take judicial steps, the law should be passed, and it seems to be able to redeem his promises.</seg>
<seg id="1377">During the Attorney General Paris Al rawi, a supporter of the law, said it is definitely more right when Maharaj wanted to go against the law, the most social media users would like to have the debate about different.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell beat:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Dear Sat, if we expect to talk the discussion so in general, in a way that we are able to talk to the state into our bedrooms, that they may be able to prevent them from large, hard-roottenen men who are contrary to the advantage of them, would you be ready to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you think that it is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">However, if it is now to a judicial action against the law, or not, this legislation is an important step - but there is still places in the world where the children are legal or still the norm, although it gives laws to say them.</seg>

<seg id="1390">Through the mirrors from websites, Turkish users can watch Wikipedia content again</seg>
<seg id="1391">The English-speaking Wikipedia page was presented in English on January 18, 2012, to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright laws in the USA, internationally darkened.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">Since over a month, Turkey weaving the popular and the Crowdsourcing principle based encyclopedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Tag tag is clear how important the platform for users can be found to share helpful and share information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students as well as reporter and fans of TV series forbid against the blocking.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many advanced users-experienced Internet users are used, conversion tools for blocking websites (a current article from the New York Times report that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world), fall by most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey had been forced by Wikipedia since 2008, like recently published in a published report by Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University will find regular block of the Internet since 2007, after the Internet Act (No. 5651) has been adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">After China, Turkey is the second most well-known country of the world when it comes to massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains closed, there are now several Mirrorsites (pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and often updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform laid out all Turkish Wikipedia sites on its decentralized peer-to-peer network, which is not based on the system of domain name, making it difficult to make a complete censorship.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is available in spite of the legal prohibition.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blogpost IPFS on his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After we heard the news (on the blocking of Wikipedia) we got everything, snapshots of Wikipedia on the IPFS platform. thus, the opportunity to read the content in decentralized and distributed way.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help the users to see at least all Wikipedia content, even if they can't reach the website www.wikipedia.org themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also gave that this stage is independent of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it only concerns screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to handle the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consoli of Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansiknock.org, an open source project that anyone can use the open source project that everyone can utilize similar Mirrorsites when it is locked in the country of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consoli reported subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices member as well as staff at Mozilla at Panigrahi's Open Boy "Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is no complete copy from a proxy address, a Mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">You'll get to another URL, that's not the original. that what you see is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Essentially the server heads the server on the right Wikipedia page, so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia even if they are closed in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">For this is executed by a server which is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This post has been written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and was originally published on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international community media organisation from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version has been published here as part of a Content-Sharing Agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India there are women with the greatest care, the names of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead they use a ponomen or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chomisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh give women to respect to the husband's social pressure, as well as the fear of consequences, they should retain the norm, these practice live in life.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto from the Indian state of Oglia was sentenced by a headcourt and to the community of the village, after having talked to a married relations with names.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition does not call their wives to name, is also common among men. however, they have far from less assignments, if ever, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the Pune district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including healthcare professionals, a unique club and thus became fast to the main talks about the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place just for them alone, where they discuss the hostesses of Patriarchate and discuss.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs, which in 13 Indian countries, he is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, which is operated by the Community video Volunteers and joined the degradation of Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Paine has been working for seven years with the help of their video camera on the discovery of practices, such as children's marriage to the turn of HIV- and AIDS-infected, and directs this clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">It reports about how this clubs created a safe place for these women and made them at the same time to the change of the wall.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video, the Rohini pointed in its discussion group, did women who do not call her husbands at the name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She decided on this theme because they wanted to start talking about the Patriarchate with a problem with whom women can easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Not according to the names of their husbands, a Brauch, whom they have pleaded not guilty, have never been placed in question.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini mean:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition bears witness that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who doesn't agree, is watched as a woman without Moral.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted in that we have never made thought of this discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini wanted to have her husband never before the name to try out at home, as it runs.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of discussions round her husband and her mother in law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini told:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband still weigh long after the video was at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said that I should call him from now on his name.</seg>
<seg id="1493">Rohini started her first discussion with this self-confidence in their luggage.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "Patriarchate" before. some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After video projection, the women tried to bring discussion with a exercise in gear.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked every participant in the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, annoying, sad, lovingly, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then she asked them all, "If we cannot tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us as they want, means they not respect us?</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equal? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day to whom they brought the name of their husbands on the lips," says Rohini Paine was from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra over the breaking of a centuries-old tradition, in which married women to never talk the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini told:</seg>
<seg id="1502">One woman was so shy that during the whole exercise just ahead of themselves; a others decided to leave the complete frustration against him and his family, stating it.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I'll never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Still in the adrenaline, with an ancient Brauch, the women decided that they would actually try to make their husbands at their name.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days, Rohini received a variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a wife called Rohini and asked what ideas behind them in the head: his wife could not stop his name to tell his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do with dinner before the entire family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When she had her mother in law, she was afraid, and said that there was an error.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Another woman said, "Rohini said that I should do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband's husband was less understanding and the situation arrived in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, like for example, the wearing of the red point on the forehead, which shows the state status:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do only women have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband, that I would bear the zinok point if it also act.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I stopped to bear it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women did not hear completely, but mine, they are now able to choose in a better position, even to choose him in some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discussion group is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"we make a trip at each discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">I don't want to make sure the women who could hear what could hear, "says it.</seg>
<seg id="1522">During the last months, they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes for the first time in her life; they dance and sang and spoke about things about which they had never made thoughts.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Raw ini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">Since so many years I have been working on these problems and yet I have been talking about some things, for example how our identities are linked to our husbands, never so honest.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to say some things loud, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion group, we have talking about the concept of honour and how it is connected to clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have borne only Saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most of it is okay, but some wanted a saline cta, a wide shirt about a trousers; they don't have darnel.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After a lot of strife and discussion about the advantages of their own clothes-election, the Moral is connected to Saris and much more, Carugsailed Rohini their own couple Kurtas (Oberhemden) in a discussion round, so that women could bear her.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they now decided to plan a trip to Goa to which they can carry jeans and Rohini is sure to make it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">"" "" "" "on the question of whether in the five months since their first discussion" "" "discussion" "" "has changed slightly, Rohini confirmed that the things are slowly moving into rolls:" ""</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have made only small steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tested it a few times, but then it stopped to say the name of her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, make it still, but only if they are alone and no other family members.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two will continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women have now wear Zinnoberrot on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes that they want to reach in their lives - like the line for more freedom of movement or the own clothes-election - at the end of a difficult to navigate the river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">Looking forward to self-confidence, it is aware of them that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How raw ini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a sacrifice of Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am it too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives everyone of us the confidence that something is going to change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction if any woman is talking about home and other people, what we speak and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1544">The correspondents of the video Volunteers community come from delimited groups in India and make videos about stories about which it is not reported.</seg>

<seg id="1628">The following version will be published under a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of incarcerated Chinese dissidents Liu Xiaobo has moved attention to the international community since his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he was hospitalized due to liver cancer in the final stage of cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for "Subversion" (citizenship), after he was involved in the draft Charter 08, a manifesto that calls for the democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"" "the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China has referred to" "" "a internal matter" "" "and a speaker tells of" "" "not necessary to discuss this thing with some other country." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1636">United Nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, Commissioner of the United Nations for Human Rights, met at the end of June of Chinese civil servants to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">However, a speaker refused to comment whether the United Nations must exert pressure to allow hay to make a treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister BÃ¸rge Brende have refused to answer questions about Lius release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway has been transferred to the store after the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 has been awarded to Liu, although the Norwegian government said they have nothing to do with decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations continued until December last year. only in June, Norway signed an agreement to relocate the salmon to China, since exports have been largely blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After that the message was spreading that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee introduced its hope on an unconditional release of release and invited Liu to pick his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to his arrest, he was not able to accept his prize.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony, Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On July 6, the European Parliament adopted a decision on which China was asked to liberate Liu and his wife immediately from house arrest and to allow him to seek medical support, where he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The leading diplomat of the EU, Federica Mogherini, in China also called for release Lius, as they did in a declaration on June 30:</seg>
<seg id="1649">At the same time, we expect all restrictions of Mr. Lius's wife and family members.</seg>

<seg id="1654">The opinion of US Embassy moved with a certain response from China after itself, with the exterior of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that "no Land has the right to be unique and unrelated comments on Chinese internal affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley shared that China should offer the following:</seg>
<seg id="1656">Protection and freedom, such as travel intelligence, and access to the medical care of his election, which they are entitled to the Chinese constitution and legal system as well as the international obligations.</seg>

<seg id="1670">All necessary measures must be taken in order to ensure that Liu Xiaobo gets all treatments which he needs. furthermore, his wife and family should have contact with him.</seg>

<seg id="1678">It is my faith that he took the initiatives that he had taken and had contributed to a harmonious, more stable and wealthy China, which would have contributed to a more peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I felt personally and encouraged me when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, the charter of 08, which stands for democracy, freedom and legal rule in China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>

<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Singapore is a city or a country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question is silly appear as Singapore has been recognized as an independent state since Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam should be viewed as a city in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting of a meeting of the international branches of the State of New York, the Minister noted that many people were the dominance of the only political party of Singapore as compared to Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He understands that Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">That's it, most people go an error.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are no country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to spin the logic in order to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and offerings, this valuable land is to be created, we hear that we finally have no country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It was so vulgar, it had the licence of a flight before the responsibilities, a mandatory infringement.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if thou art not my country whose land is it?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons mentioned by Shanmugam were not very pleased: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in view of its, he appeared insoftened.</seg>
<seg id="1699">On the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally the cities that are permanently led by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratically.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Once you reach the core point of the theme, once again the good old glue of the authoritarian feasers return to be democratory logic, leaving the twisted logic, because they fit better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the final outcome, the responses were given by Shanmugam on the last week of Shanmugam answers to his American guests in our press, our Judikative, our political system really non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">Related questions tar.gz with non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls for Shanmugam, his opinion, since they have not understood this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country but a city, so to which country owns our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">Shortly, I understand nothing.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very thankful if our werder K Shanmugam would take on the effort to clarify this point if he was high paid to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">Based on the blog his comment, he shows referring to the reviews that you should start to read the whole address of the conference, so that you could understand the context of the statements by Shanmugam better, according to which Singapore has a city and no country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said that Singapore has more a" "" "city" "" "as a country," "" "he stated why the elections in Singapore will be so unwilling, even if we are looking forward to free and just elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He dispersed Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said, Singapore" "" "be not a country," "" "he obviously didn't tell it in that sense!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment over Shanmugam, who makes the leader of a heralgrowing generation, making such a polemic statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">"" "" "" "I am about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore has said," ""... "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old Garde that I expected to agree with them or not, but this is another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, member of the new generation of the political leader of Singapore, I have doubt and I'm not even sure whether he really believes, really associated and aware of what he defended.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The Temasek Review summarizes the weak points of Shanmugam arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">Did Mr. Shanmugam committed an error. "did Mr. Shanmugam committed an error, or was it a friend driver?</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, we are only regarded as an independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, what country is the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally country and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since he plays an important role within the government office, the statements of Mr. Shanmugam are of serious importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do the people help their military service, but they only defend their city?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must pay our Prime Minister?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink staff?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">But the Journey Journey of a Decade to the mean age, Singapore is always a city:</seg>
<seg id="1729">"I did not say what I said..."</seg>
<seg id="1730">This pack seems to have many people more expensive...</seg>
<seg id="1731">No one has ever told that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We were always a town / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">I can understand that we often hear statements such as "the defense of the country mainly" etc., but this is not quite true.</seg>
<seg id="1735">We were to speak from the defense of the city.</seg>

<seg id="1740">Your answers are published here as part of a continuous series, with the rumours that should be revealed and another facet should be shown.</seg>
<seg id="1741">The newest part of this series is from Nevto Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1742">The question that is placed in Japan on most, is: "are you American?"</seg>
<seg id="1743">"" "" "" "no, I'm sorry," "" "I come from Canada." "" "I come from Canada." "" "since 1994 I live and again in Japan." ""</seg>

<seg id="1745">In my clarification then the standard response follows: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice-hockey, nature." many cops are perhaps unfortunate before rage, but if they are kept for Americans, but do not disturb me.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For somebody who doesn't know, there are little who distinguishes ourselves from Americans.</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why the Canadian flag bring a Canadian flag well visible on their backpack when travelling.</seg>
<seg id="1748">All love Canadian.</seg>
<seg id="1749">Americans, however....</seg>
<seg id="1750">So it was, when I started travelling around the world 20 years ago - before Donald Trump, before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11.</seg>
<seg id="1751">Canadian have always applied little bulls of their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="1752">We have a free health care!</seg>
<seg id="1753">There is no weapons with us!</seg>
<seg id="1754">The same sexes have been legal in Canada since 2005!</seg>
<seg id="1755">All seem to think, Canada is so great.</seg>
<seg id="1756">We are polite.</seg>
<seg id="1757">We obviously say very often "excuse."</seg>
<seg id="1758">Canada is also supposed to be the tolerant country opposite ethnic groups.</seg>
<seg id="1759">We are not as such as those types south of the border.</seg>
<seg id="1760">We are Canadian.</seg>
<seg id="1761">I hate it.</seg>
<seg id="1762">First, I have many American friends who I admired a lot.</seg>
<seg id="1763">It would not make me nothing, if one would change to Johnny in Dallas by example.</seg>
<seg id="1764">With Marc out of Austin.</seg>
<seg id="1765">With Adam from San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Or with Michael from Honolulu.</seg>
<seg id="1767">There are also some problems with the stamp "nice."</seg>
<seg id="1768">First: to be called "nice" to be diligent to be diligently - as the haughty, gentle, but tragically insignificant figure Ned Flanders of "The Simpsons" (one of their own Canadian double).</seg>
<seg id="1769">If Canada is really a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, this would be a step forward. but the real problem exists in that "nice" does not have any personality.</seg>
<seg id="1770">There are no corners and edges, nothing at which one can stumble.</seg>
<seg id="1771">Harmless, is inconspicuous and uninteresting to earn no attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">This may be something good if you want to remain unnoticed in the background, from the things that happen around a round.</seg>
<seg id="1773">I would even go to say that the wish to be free and only to be one of the Canadian citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to take care of our own affairs.</seg>
<seg id="1775">What can be viewed as "nice" but is maybe just cool politeness.</seg>
<seg id="1776">Canadian don't talk about the fence with the neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="1777">We lacks a warm welcome, open kindness, which I now connect to my American friends.</seg>
<seg id="1778">Thankful for us (and for the rest of the world) then Justin Trudeau took the stage to show that Canadian has made more than just "nice." our prime minister has almost made of sexy.</seg>

<seg id="1780">One in Thailand famous Pop-Band has published a music video, which the Junta parodiert, who took power in 2014 and restore power in 2014, still ruled the country.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phadet Girl) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man, who told him that rules his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1782">Although it is not explicitly politically, music video refers to the continued military supremacy of the Junta.</seg>

<seg id="1784">The video to song was a huge success.</seg>

<seg id="1786">Last month, the Charlie Chaplin video "The dictator" was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists complained to see this video.</seg>
<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to the Thai policy, inbreeding such as it holds the situation in the country under the Junta rule.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Look at once these recordings of the video, which relate to some of the political issues that have been kept in the last three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">The "44 rules of the girls" may refer to the draconical section of 44 of the preliminary Constitution, which the Chief of Chief of the Heeres absolute decision-making decisions on important national issues.</seg>
<seg id="1790">"" "the 11th rule:" "" "change your attitude" "" "refers to the notorious programme for" "" "Settings, students, scientists, activists, policies and other people who are regarded as a critic by the Junta." ""</seg>
<seg id="1791">The picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer criminality, whose vage and unclear rules often have been used by the authorities to conceal activist and other reviewers of the state.</seg>
<seg id="1792">For this purpose, a new unit was set up in the Army, which monitors online content and people, to which the monarchy is accused of having persecuted and prosecuted the monarchy.</seg>

<seg id="1794">On 20 May 2014, the war was proclaimed in Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="1795">Two days later the army came to a coup.</seg>
<seg id="1796">One of the problems, which the Junta continues to buy, is their decision to buy U-boats, although security experts would warned that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax collectors.</seg>
<seg id="1797">In the video you will even show how people will be thrown into a black vans before they bring them into an internment camp, another problem.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Some journalists are sitting in prison, because they allegedly killed "confusion" in society and the use of Internet users are threatened to revive the monarchy.</seg>

<seg id="1898">On the road to migrants who cross Europe or Latin America, some places for their hospitality will be known.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tapachula, he is located at the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is led by a 59- year old Mexican artist, a little woman with a corals of cordial and gold bezel in teddy bear in teddy bear.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name of Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This peak surname is the fact that the hotel (or rather it has become a goal of Africans and Haitians, who are on the passage.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about $2,50 the night the guests sleep in simple rooms, with grinding, crumbled walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless there are hundreds of African and Haitian migrants here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Mrs. RamÃ­rez tells you the people in a few small buses and from the upper part of the coast they start to call: "mom Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you mum Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">Currently there is rather quiet but this year RamÃ­rez already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have already slept outside on boxes.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She wants to reject no one.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and bring them to the hospital if they are sick, she buys them medications that they could not pay them, they massaged them with a balm that they stole away from long voyage.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, has arrived in front of a short time.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa is a reasonable first name for Ms. RamÃ­rez.</seg>

<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister, who hopes to get to Boston where her husband and the three children return.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They have already lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on the way to the United States, normally a first stop in South America and then go towards the north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had owned by other wayfarers of Mama Africa. "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the route," Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that Haitians and the Africans often travel together the route and that the Africans are talking about WhatsApp of Mrs. RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">How many of his Wegner leaders lived Michelet previously in Brazil and worked as a construction worker at the construction sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy was weaker, he started his journey into the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: it sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him whether he is in contact with Mrs. RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"" "" "" "Mama Africa is our mother and we never let go back," "" "he was smiling and we will always stay in touch." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1932">Ms. RamÃ­rez tells us that their guests have to send their often text messages when they are going to grate them or to report on the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">It explains that their Christian faith is the drive of their work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">They don't know much about Africa, but their guests have taught you to prepare chicken as in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Mrs. RamÃ­rez is perhaps very well known here, but it is not the only sparking hope for migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the town a Sackgasse leads to JesÃºs Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">In this winter, Valenzuela and his family have enrolled migrants in their little house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">It is policeman and has found that the Bustets are sold too expensive on numerous African migrants.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He began to help them to get a reasonable price, then he has offered them his house for one dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment, there are 25 people, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep in ceilings on the ground, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking site outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests do.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I have lived in the United States," says he. "I experienced what they experienced.</seg>
<seg id="1944">I have crossed the border over the desert and we have suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others do not help. that's the reason why I give them my support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">After having lived for three years, he was expelled after a raid on his work place from the United States after a raid.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travels through Tapachula, comes from Central America, other residents open the doors of their houses to them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">JosÃ© Antonio Cordova MelÃ©ndez tells me that he has fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children prior to people who wanted to compress money of him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown, a single bearing, has offered him a roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later the family lives and tried to decide where the next steps should go.</seg>

<seg id="1953">A minibus has arrived today and has 20 new guests, a large majority of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Mrs. RamÃ­rez seems happy about that her house is full but she is also nostalgisch, because of those who have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother they shattered them in their album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There are one of her daughter with African hair care that you made a Kundin, some photos of their grandchildren and many travelers more, kids and elderly.</seg>

<seg id="1960">A check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjang from Twitter-User.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The residents of Xinjiang, an ethnic minorities region in West China, are forced to install a spyware on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On 10 July, the mobile users in the Tianshan district of the town of Urumqi was assigned a phone notification, which it features a monitoring app called Jingwang (or "Web cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in the message it is said that the app" "" "should be able to obtain access to terrorist information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the authorities must use the app for more than the fight against terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to a exclusive report of Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh was arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture, because she had installed the app shortly after they had replaced the app.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the communication of the police, the app determine the sources and the distribution paths of the terrorists and follow, along with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information" including videos, pictures, ebooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the App as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective service provider with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is the blocking of pornographic websites, by online scam, Troians and Phishing pages to make users browsing this way, how much time they spend online in order to remote control the home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app features the filters for minors to help children to develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these features can be used in a varied way.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the remote control 'remote actors or even hackers can manipulate the home network of a person or steal it.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction will be in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While the messages about digital censorship in China are mostly concentrated on the experience of users in major cities in the East and the South, reality is very often dark for those who live in remote, urged ethnic minority regions like Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">To limit unrest and dissatisfaction in conflict areas, authorities often arrange extreme censors and monitoring measures, as well as routinely internet deplements.</seg>
<seg id="1976">Based on Twitter-based media outlet "Images from the Republic of China" (Munich), the scenic news in China was published, displayed photos from a Checkpoint where policemen trained indiscriminately, whether they had installed the monitoring app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian ensure that people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification demanded that people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are detected at a Checkpoint using a device without these software, they could be imprisoned up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a blow for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They are forced to use devices that are intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity through future growth technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from the cities of China" (located in the sexes turn), also published a Jingwang product description from which the software can lift the password requirement of a Windows operating system and thus obtain unrestricted access to the computer's hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After the installation of Jingwang, computers and cellphones are in Xinjiang to electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The regulations in Jingwang are possibly a reaction to the instructions of the party council to minimize the dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government departments, authorities and party associations, including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office during operation of their computer and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A current report from Freedom House, a US-American Human Rights organization, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang published the authorities on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi a regulation with orders on all residents and entrepreneurs, to register their "personal ID cards, cell phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks, and media memory cards" at the local police.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obvious to identify and destroy any "terrorist videos." this action is violated the personality rights of urumquis three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a whole range of other possible prices, including those who relate to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="2060">I have accustomed to answer it, not to answer.</seg>
<seg id="2061">I really cannot say anything to say when Beleivers and strokes after a friendly conversation for me had become more common communication.</seg>
<seg id="2062">When and how that happened, was unimportant.</seg>
<seg id="2063">Some voice in me told me that I had to be punished or failing to be punished, even though I had done nothing to earn this sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2064">An penalty in all of its diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2065">His command is to rip so much meat as possible from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2066">It is called the lovingly "confession."</seg>
<seg id="2067">It starts with a plastic pipe which probably comes out of the cloaca.</seg>
<seg id="2068">Your Henker gave up to your cry.</seg>
<seg id="2069">Give it the pleasure that you can't measure you with him and you can't keep your cry.</seg>
<seg id="2070">My cry was not enough for him, so they caught the pipe through a cable.</seg>
<seg id="2071">In my first arrest, I asked if the investigator had been working earlier times as a refuse or whether that belonged to normal work equipment.</seg>
<seg id="2072">They had four cables in each other to present us, from their point of view, great invention of a giant cable.</seg>
<seg id="2073">In one hour changes three of them seldom appeared, while still on the series.</seg>
<seg id="2074">I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice, why I listened to shout.</seg>
<seg id="2075">The Henker noted the cooling down and had no pleasure in mind, which is why it was next to an electrically charged rod.</seg>
<seg id="2076">Electricity through all the body, enough to feed my whole quarter.</seg>
<seg id="2077">My semi-bare body, which was stretched out on the ground, was the perfect power conductor.</seg>
<seg id="2078">The diver disappeared and the pain was back.</seg>
<seg id="2079">After two horrible hours, he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night.</seg>
<seg id="2080">This must have been so at midnight.</seg>
<seg id="2081">I decided to sleep back on me; let's say that it was my only option.</seg>
<seg id="2082">Some hours passed, which came to me as minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Then the call to the dawn.</seg>
<seg id="2084">The door opens and the morning light meets the room ".Raus with you, Arschficker."</seg>
<seg id="2085">"" "I am answering with the voice of an exhausted young people:" "" "my lord, my father must be fearful worries." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2086">"be quiet, and away you, you will be moved."</seg>
<seg id="2087">That was new.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Otherwise they released me.</seg>
<seg id="2089">Where do they lead me?!</seg>
<seg id="2090">The Jordanian Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, free expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib brings the majority of its time in the room; times he mashed to his screen, once in his computer, and again to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">When you can leave, there is a cigarette among his fingers or to discover the lips of nicotin maculate lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the top of his family house which had been part of them since 1967; the year where Israel had completed its occupation of the West Bank and the Hdaibs family had been forced to flee from its village in Palestine, where they had lived as feliyeen (about: farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years Hdaib is a passionate activity that the conservative majority was transferred to gender equality and their old proven opinions on gender roles, sexuality and free expression of opinion by art and rave.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, often out with topics such as Orientalism, racism, and the situation of Palestinian gevolatts, he also demands the nucleus of the entire Arab world. all these topics do not only find out in its hometown of America, but also in cities that are enough by Damascus in Syria as far as to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With his 25 years, Hdaib sees itself in its thinking not restricted by borders, and it is able to suffer according to their own statement with people who have among the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries like Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even though he is not open to offend, he is a special baffection to U.S. foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib doesn't believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war areas where he was born, even if he was born in Jordan himself, even if he was born in Jordan and never before Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think of my own life!" emphasises Hdaib.</seg>
<seg id="2104">Then he adds: "I think so, because I am a man," during he dissolved the nest of Ramadan in two cups. it is the holy month Ramadan; in this period it is planned for Muslims at sunrise until sundown.</seg>
<seg id="2105">The law also says that the public consumption of food is illegal during Ramadan.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Apparently, Hdaib has a certain weaknesses to break with ancient traditions. on the other hand, a cup of coffee has a sensual hot Junitag little with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically, the battles are pure coffee and the scissors of the Cent-cigarette in the nose in the nose in the first line of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the free sky, especially if one throws a look into the neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Of which, it avoids easy to do basic things - as to the public during Ramadan water - to do not in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has cancelled a performance of the band Mashrou'Leila, had to be cancelled for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some parliamentary elections that support the Islamist branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that sexual orientation of the homosexual frontiers Hamed Sinno, contradict the cultural and traditional norms of the country, talks and the main reason for the concert table.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The members of the Islamic Coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert "just had to be cancelled due to sexual orientation of the owner.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many claim to be the commitment of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, Human Rights and free expression of opinion in the Arab world be more dangerous activism, which represents the old proven legitimacy regime in the entire region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila endorsed the Jordanian people as "progressive supporters of human rights" to continue to use "for intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement would be probably not easy to reach Rhetork, but actually a clear crystal-crystallized reality in Jordan was clearly reflected in Hdaib's plant.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib traditional gender norms into the body, having formed his vision of the fate of arabic women, which have voiced sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of a apparently spotted woman, whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by hands of those who actually should trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In the past few years the number of Honor's number has increased in Jordan - the inofficial externally.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Human Rights Watch, according to the number of Honor of Honor in 2016, reached its zenith; however, the number of institutional infrastructure is missing in order to support the women who tried to support murder or domestic violence at an appropriate manner.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law from 1954, women may be exposed to the risk of unfamiliar violence, "at uncertain time in prison," and for their release is often a lonely bureaucratic effort as well as the guarantee on family, that the woman will not happen nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Hdaibs Music is also pleased with great popularity and is well known to replicate the topics in his country long as taboo.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib contest that his work is politically, but is that he is his music, which is full of exponations on sexuality, freedom and expression of expression, cannot be separated from politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man.</seg>
<seg id="2125">"" "I became a policy," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed", Hdaib takes the question of the Palestinian identity in attack.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and "Ghareeb," the focus will be on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are politically active in the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016, Hdaib released a song titled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a scripture is repeated:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free and everyone else is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the course of the song, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market, on which one can get in his words, "what you want" - whether faith or non-believing, heterogenic or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">It notices that hardly anyone stated in Jordan on the rights of gay and lesbians, and comments on equality between LGBTQ + individuals will be censored in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014 Hdaib led an interview for the popular jordan OnlineProgram Roya, in order to remark that his comments were torn out of the context and had been censored in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"" "" "" "on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but only one worked version," "" "says he." ""</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib advertises the Arabic LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that Intolerance opposed to Islam did not talk to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, which still remains in memory thanks to its homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks: if Abu Nuwhat, who should work later on behalf of the Caliph, could write in the eighth century open over homosexuality, why can't they do this?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, such as Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert had to be cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemian kingdom there is nothing new that the government attacks on the free expression of opinion and that progressive voices will be brought to silence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian newspaper acquired several former government members and members of the teacher's association with the grounds of criticizing themselves on comments in social media to the problems associated with the deeply rooted in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of what is the Hdaibs concert, only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to work a structural change in the next generation of the Jordan.</seg>
<seg id="2143">Progress for him is progress, and take refuge. Jordan has denied a performance, but the progress of progress - so it looks like Hdaib - consists of slow, print and inhospitable changes. it is sure that these changes take place every day in the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Finally, Hdaib dreams, like millions of other Arabs too, from an Arab world without interventions.</seg>
<seg id="2145">"" "he dreaming, not only of them to bring his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to" "" "them." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region is attainable with the help of music, art and literature of a real and basic graviity - and not through bombs, strewitions and on artificial kind, democracy. at least, he hopes it.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until far as far as far, Hdaib is further expansion and consequently also the resistance.</seg>

<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These great, extravagant soldiers are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta Festivals.</seg>
<seg id="2152">It is thought that there is a variation of Tanabata Festival, which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of the Tohokus, and from one time come, in the armed forces from west Japan to the northeastern marschated to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emishi to force the knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to grab a few great places, therefore we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">You can only imagine how big these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A joint center in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organized a two-month exhibition to Wa no Akari (littl).</seg>
<seg id="2157">I've been looking forward to the Meguro Gajoen again for a long time: two caravans are just visible.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the journey to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival will take the only truth- and in this way to spend his summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>
<seg id="2160">Yattemare! "# Summer Festival in the North of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2161">I was there, and I watched the # NebutaFestival.</seg>
<seg id="2162">The sight of a 18 metres heighted car was incredible.</seg>
<seg id="2163">Let us enjoy the rest of the summer!</seg>

<seg id="2168">El Callao, Perus most important port, located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, close to the historic centre of Lima - a region with a very high crime rate, where street smoking and illegal drug trades are daily.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region are not safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time, Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - a rising demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, the appearance and therefore the unusual hairstyle of famous athletes, such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), led to Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led to give yourself more normal citizens into the experienced hands of hairstyle, who can create these unpleasant hairdresser.</seg>
<seg id="2172">Unprecedented demand for hairstyle, which go to the outward boundaries of imagination and creativity, even an annual event inspired by the contest of hairdresser's "Batalla de Barberos" competition, which has been running since 2014.</seg>

<seg id="2178">Colombia: love letters to Guerillakens</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">The following article is the revised version of the Beitrags "Liebesbidden to Guerillusionists," which published the international online magazine Tea after Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">This contribution is published here in the framework of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write only love letters to people who we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not yet much more important, people who feel outstretched out, affection for?</seg>
<seg id="2185">Exactly this question was the two young Colombian activists from BogotArt and Cristian Palacios from the Young Youth Foundation, who inspired them to write them to the campaign cartas por la ReconciliaciÃ³n (letters to reconciliation), who encouraged young people to sign guerrilla letters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Recently, her country was held a historic event, and they wanted to contribute their part thereof: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had closed a peace treaty with the GuerillaMovement FARC (German: revolutionary forces in Colombia), which forms the stage of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">International was considered to be the signing of the peace agreement as so important that the Colombian President JosÃ© Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his contributions to the Nobel Peace Prize.</seg>
<seg id="2188">However, in front of the column, there is a long way to talk about a real reconciliation and peace of peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla struggles, who had lived for many years in illegal camps, were exposed to war rhetoric and around the clock, they have to integrate their weapons in life as an civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian company again, who had reconciled to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred against guillaries, they have to support them in their ranks, and support them in construction of a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian was convinced that the young Colombian have to close together and help the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And just this did they have: until now, thousands of young people wrote letters - love message to former guerilla struggles to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The goal of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for each former guillating fighters who shall be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as an inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for reconciliation was formed at the world summit of the Nobel Peace Laureate, which took place in BogotÃ¡ in February 2017. Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to speak with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This declared that we love the people whom we love to write on Valentine's Day of thousands of love letters, but those who need to need much more needless.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He has told, he told us to share his love with people who needed to support the most urgent matters.</seg>
<seg id="2198">So the plan was created to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC. "the letters will show that the Colombian company is ready to make the discourse of a war history to a common history of peace." they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Until now, more than 2000 letters were collected within the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities in Colombia such as Cali, Manicales, MedellÃ­n, Barranquilla and BogotÃ¡.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'I would never thought that someone would forgive someone "</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to the Caldono-Cauca region on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the Municipal Administration of Cali and Leonardo from the Foundation BogotArt reists to bring up the letters personally.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC did so on how they had done it earlier in order to accept the commands of their leader.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they received no precepts, but letters full of protecting people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for all participants. "it's amazing how many different feelings one can walk through to happiness and everything that is between," told the political science students Betty JimÃ©nez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a member of the governor of the province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After having passed the letters, a former fighter made me by the camp of Guerilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cambook" (a kind of cottage where the guerrilla lives), I saw a grooved which he wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go in, because beside him on the bed a MGL pomegranate, a deadly weapon in the Dornap.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "I asked him," "" "hello, what are they doing?" "" "he answered," "" "I am answering a letter which someone has written to me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeless letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Never in my life I wrote something like a nice thing, so I answer it. "I suddenly ran out tears over the cheeks.</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him completely, and set me next to the pomegranate.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was sorry for war! I'm sorry to be all the years of faithful Companions, and wanted to help him to write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never had something different from life than war. the FARC had never been able to store him and his six brothers before Hungertod. "I never thought that someone would forgive someone myself for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society there, who is waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now I have learned to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">But now where peace rules, I can learn many things and work in dignity. "</seg>
<seg id="2220">New votes</seg>
<seg id="2221">A prelude came to students and some leaders of the FARC on a discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all raised up as early as the war and the FARC already had already in secret places.</seg>
<seg id="2223">Therefore the leader of the FARC declared the history of the organization, their ideals and gave insight into their views over the peace process: "many years we have experienced, as we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party, we can contribute to the society in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">A goal of this size is worth to overcome all obstacles, "said one of them.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">These people, who had never found hearing, and not to know that humans that I have often seen as monster and even hate them, even people with beautiful feelings - have been turned by their lifespan and their environment, was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality, in which the country lives, does it hurt me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But comfort me that all men - even those who have killed and so much damage caused to bring us a little bit and a smile and a hug can give us.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have answered the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo GonzÃ¡lez, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote to the example DarÃ­o de JesÃºs Monsalve, the Archbishop of the City of Cali, following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The column was made known to reign in peace after deforestation.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as it is inequality, hunger and a lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are willing to lift up to the weapons and to protest their rights and that is also entirely justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We use the FARC on peace to a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call all the Defender of Peace - regardless of race, religion or ideology, they are over all those who dream of a country in the war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, afford our contribution and offer victims, for we know from their own experience that nothing is simple. denotes for those who defend life as the basis of existence, many difficulties will be impending.</seg>
<seg id="2237">There will be many obstacles on our way, but we will overcome them together.</seg>

<seg id="2245">But the threat, which is like a damsel-value over the dorsal LGBTQ community, isn't until the night was created.</seg>
<seg id="2246">OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a transsexual woman from Grozny, who shared some of their experiences with us and talked with us what is currently in the republic.</seg>

<seg id="2248">The first report was published by the journalist Elena Milashina in Nowaja Gaseta; she threw a light on the methods of the Chechen authorities, suspicious queer men, and put them in secret prisons in Argun.</seg>

<seg id="2251">Already since her childhood, she felt that she was a woman in reality.</seg>
<seg id="2252">When they were grown, it became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for them, why she went to Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="2253">After having experienced a group of Chechens from the gender equality of their landlady, the hunt was opened on Sabrina.</seg>
<seg id="2254">From fear of her life, she moved the last dudes into the United States.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I worked as a volunteer Helferin with a human rights organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day told me that someone needed to help my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">It was a friend of Dagestan, a transwife that installs in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2258">She had no money, so I took it without hesitation.</seg>
<seg id="2259">While I tried to help her, he was a friend of my documents and spread them everywhere in the internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. he sent them away to his cheeks, with the following message: "then there is no men more in Chechnya who can eliminate these reproach?"</seg>

<seg id="2263">When I turned me, I felt a little in my body, but I did not hurt me.</seg>
<seg id="2264">Then I heard a set, but this time at Chechen: "how long will you be able to honor the family?"</seg>

<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are obsolete, since there is still my male name dron; but the physician stopped, and laid me for the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very grateful to him.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time in his office, I got it to do with the fear; it was a Muslim name, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out as a good man.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I'm thankful to him that he had been respectfully with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than one month in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I got drauctions.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote me - Related, strange, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of an alphabet.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family visited from neighbours and some remote relations.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The requested that sent me to Chechnya, to prove that everything was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They set absurd claims: some told me, I had to prove it by the streets; others wanted that I had not changed in the official television in Grozy, and say that I had not changed my sex that everything was just bad, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what would I have to say in television?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how has your family tries to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it is still difficult for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older people spoke at once my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">They said to her, "They have brought a monster to the world, that is not only your family, but the whole republic is ashamed.</seg>
<seg id="2290">We cannot touch you, because you're a pious woman, but you must disappear from here. "</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother was too much and she laid a strick around the neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Thankfully, the neighbours came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with darkened windows and a number plate with a 95 dron.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened for the third time it was clear that there was slightly lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights friends test the numbering sign - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how are you fled?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For safety reasons I don't want to give her name, but I want to say that I remember them all, they have really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With their help, I left the country, but then something unbelief.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before my departure from Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought it without registration, without identification, without identification.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and cast them into the litter.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Came to and checked to the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered at a foreigner.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">At the moment when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message: "you don't believe you, only because you have left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know, in which hotel you put on. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Just to prove it: it is number 115. "</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine that?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was really my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">But we do not talk about gender equality, however, this is a tabletheme.</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still carry some traditional Caucasian elements in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">So very I wish you to overcome this sealan barrier I can not overcome.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I say always, as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to violate them.</seg>
<seg id="2319">If we chat with camera, I give me good effort to look like the person from their past - thus reminiscent of my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But this is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends do, those who are diting?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report in Washington for last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For whom I needed more information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I spoke with someone who left one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He was told that Ramadan had not been arrested and tortured throughout the Ramadan, but also that all the end of Ramadan had hardly been waiting to wait, and he did not end a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they are now focusing on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">So that my opinion, they probably invite their relative to the problem with the affected person and at the end a proof of that the so-called "honor" through blood has experience.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are there still pregnant men held in these secret places?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of me, there wouldn't be many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, especially those that have no sufficient relative or dropped from their relatives to show Kadyrows judgment.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they will be held there, so that they can present them later as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Say: should they be killed, you'll show their bodies in television and claim to attack any village or military support.</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">However, these people are not simply disappeared, but dipped specifically to radicalize.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is that only a mutation or have you a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I'm visiting someone who was incarcerated for one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their Bart had grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new of them since then.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply have taken them.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was taken even when these people were taken away.</seg>
<seg id="2342">However, until now they were not presented as bandits, so far there were no reports so far. we guess that such actions are quite possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else if you don't have this man to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people who belong to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation that took place in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always bore my hair for ever.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think already before 2003 I was already familiar with very Grozny, when I lived there - and I never had problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when Sharia was considered, I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, it was much more secure than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">In Russia, Russia wanted to lead us to "civilian," but ultimately rejected us in the Stone Age.</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is it possible under the Scharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were baked; I had coloured eyelashes, carried out the tube and short teops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The security Ministry of Sharia has never eaten a hair even a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In front of the Russian Theatre in Grozny there was a place where there was every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people like me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several banks stood, and the whole city knew what men, young people met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been insulted.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a speechless: Kharda ma Kharda. that means: "Spotto do not over the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">You often say it often to children, when they are fun for sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they just shut down their eyes before you, because they believed that you are sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never have ended, never chased and never smitten.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this amnesty set time?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long, until Kadyrow stood on the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began to speak in television about Moral.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He spoke not to us by se, but dependable on the behaviour of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - it was able to feel like people in the city began to change.</seg>
<seg id="2368">He who stayed before and was laughed, looked at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In the time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home, I was able to feel like the situation in the Republic constantly worsened.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: which activities do you go now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I do not earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Of which I'm still working as a activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicated with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We perfectly organize Teetnffs, gathering and do them to the hospital and help them to get food cards.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't have a cents.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I have discovered this man myself when I ruffed damaging.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslim and want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: this is allied.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So, nature, that has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Chechens, which you want to proof with foam before the mouth that there is no gay at them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestans have, who have the cabariner, who have Russians also, on the whole planet, but they are not in Chechnya. "</seg>
<seg id="2386">I'm coming from there, so it's easy to hear what to hear.</seg>
<seg id="2387">Here I meet so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque, and during Ramadan fasten - live with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">Do you know, many think of transidentity of men, men love, and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experience. but this is a Trusteer.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different kinds of sensation to be exact, different life settings.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important to feel me in my own skin and not ashamed for my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Do not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">I'm sorry that I'm so personally, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not sad at all - I don't know that I myself am now.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warns before an increase of self-moral within the Arab Ahmadazi community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahwaz region suffer from an unusually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the local Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">For the last months there has been a strong increase of self-morden.</seg>

<seg id="2400">The self-combustion of a man named Jassim Moramazi on 27 August, the desperate situation of the Arabian Ahmadazi community in Iran, which is dominated by poverty and unemployment.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he dwelt in Al-Thawra in the Cherwaz region in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered under anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed to come up for his own Forest, who would like to work for his family, so Ahwazi's rights groups working in Ahwaz and want to remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">One on YouTube video turned the moments after he had kindled himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people made it fast to erase the flames again, and Moramazi was brought to the Taleghani hospital in the city of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, burns were so strong that doctors could not do nothing more.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died a short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide that has occurred in August within the Arab Ahwazi minority, and activists warned about that more men could take life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim - started.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have a matter together: there were all family members who were based on the persecution of the Iranian government, helpless and irable to take their families to nourish and safe work.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region, in which a large majority of the Arab ancestor Arab ancestor community, was shaken by a profound economic crisis, which makes it difficult to contest its native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was an especially autonomous region in Iran, until the Pahlavi monarchy took power and took major efforts in 1925, to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahwaz region there are some of the largest in Iran next oil and gas fields, as well as some of the most varied and most valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite this valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the native population has only little of that wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often victims of untreated diseases, hunger and discharge.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime refuses the Ahwazi-Arabs systematically work in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government also built a variety of dams, the waters of the Arab areas in the Persian areas where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are being redirected.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have led only to destroy the devastation in the region by drought, and local agriculture, as well as fish and palm trees.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among Arab Ahawzi-adolescents rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian-General director of cooperating, work and social welfare, applied that 5% of the Ahwazis, who are looking for a job, completed primary school and have completed 45% a university degree.</seg>
<seg id="2421">A "systematic strategy... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian Ahmadazi human rights activist with residence in London, told Global Voices that the current situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and racist, ethnic discrimination," leads to a "high rise" in the number of suicide among young Ahwazi men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Dohimi said that particularly the unemployment rate has become more worse. the reason for this is a combination of a high number of in Ahwaz, upcoming ethnic Persians and an anti-Arab discrimination in the setting process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since functionaries and institutions prefers to adjust Arab labour force, the local Arab Ahwazi will unite access to work possibilities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime which aims to destroy the spirit of the resistance of young Arabs and to force her life outside of her homeland Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to stop their name and surnames to hide their belonging to the Ahwazi, because even Arab names are not tolerated in the workplace, because the speaking of the Arab language or the wearing of Arab clothing.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the given circumstances that have to bear the Arab Ahwazi, human rights activist Alarm before the situation exploded.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to wait, whether the world wake up and consider it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>

<seg id="2440">For example, women nowadays still earn less money in spite of equal education.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under stringent observation when it is about to do with her body.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social science still ensure that women are going up earlier or later in various fields of life to a glass ceiling, and that discrimination based on sex is still crosswise through many different countries and beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is aware and known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced of it and I suffer twice and triple among them.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet: if I come on skin colour, on racism, on black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women from the Diaspora; if I have been suffering from racuse and discrimination, both in and outside of feminist movement, many white feminists and white intersectional feminists.</seg>
<seg id="2448">"" "however, all that women - all women - should come together to come" "" "to sing" "" "their voices and" "" "Kumbaya, my lord" "" "to sing the equality (some) of women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don't want to talk about that it is in addition to sexual violence a member of assisting violence motivated violence, who are black women exposed to two times.</seg>

<seg id="2452">Or that women in black women and women with a migration background are exposed to higher risk to suffer domestic violence and violence in the partnership, as white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the other hand, I want all women, all the men and all persons each have neither skin colour the same rights. on the other hand, I can't join me as a black woman, who refuses to consider unjust sins in their thinking, which relate to their sex as well as to the skin colour of one person.</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the shortened and working version of the article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay" of Kurds. the article belongs to the series # PorSerMujer (# weilicheinefraubin), which is talking about the altwave opposite women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names were changed to protect the people affected.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police Commissioner said Ada BÃ¡ez, that they had nothing against Luis Balbuena, her exclusive partner who had become violent against her.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of its relationship has been over time and the police said, her statement would be laid to the acts, but more could not do.</seg>
<seg id="2484">In case of a further wife Balbuena was used for mistreatment, even the acute memorative display of Ada BÃ¡ez was nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second woman moved back to her ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">The inflation of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If women have to display at all times, they generally receive no support for the State.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women are also financially dependent on men who are misharassed. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence at all at the prosecution authorities.</seg>
<seg id="2489">Ingredients and Statistics: 2 Invisible mistakes and a legal system that nothing undergoing 3 Paraguay laws: good approach, manageous implementation strokes and stats</seg>
<seg id="2490">It is difficult to determine how many women are really harassed, says Myrian GonzÃ¡lez, Research for Gender Research in Paraguay. "there are various data and reports, but they are not even a full-critical violence against women in Paraguay," says it.</seg>
<seg id="2491">However, the numbers available are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, with the Attorney General Attorney 9600 ads went to domestic violence. at 70% of them, violence against women went violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of ads in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 ads for domestic violence in the peace dishes. 86% of ads came here.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the survey, 40% of women said that they were physically harassed, 55% of women said of psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">However, these statistics show not the true magnitude of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the paraguan Women's Minister Ana Baiardi will also be indicated only a few of these criminal offences. "for every woman who will not be reimbursed in Paraguay for psychological abuse, 9 women who do not do this.</seg>
<seg id="2498">"" "on every woman who will be reimbursed for physical abuse, two women who do not do this," "" "declared it at the end of 2014." ""</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since women's suicide in Paraguay no own criminal offences, the prosecution authorities may not be adequately documented, as many women are murdered every year from their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">By August 2016, journalists killed at least 12 cases of women in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinators of Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases, in which women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>

<seg id="2504">Unvisible mistreations and a legal system that does not undertake</seg>
<seg id="2505">Before Mariana BrÃ­tez was the strong friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she named him the name of all their former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">At the beginning she didn't wanted to do this, but then after. this should always regret it.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today, Mariana is 28 years old and no more with Carlos. but two years they took the psychic violence against women - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most severe recognizable:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I have never thought that I would have been victim of mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2509">If I have read earlier about it, I thought that only women happen to subvert because they are led away from violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that I would never happen that.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report about the abuse through Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without the name, they wrote contributions on Facebook, in which they described his insults and various attacks during their two years relationship, and told how he had insulated them.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people answered their contributions, including Carlos itself. he asked rhetoric if he ever raised the hand against them and refused to ensure that his behaviour was also a form of mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana, why they had fallen this so long by Carlos and didn't leave him earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as they wanted to say that victims of mistrements would have at least a certain debt.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, which is not made up of Paraguay, fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay, to prove that their former partner was mistretreated.</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the Yo-CREO network ("I believe you") which consists of women who are all in any manner victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group you can talk to others on their experiences, listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: take the women's statements.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case everything started with psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her wealthy partner finally succeeded to convince her that she was imploosed.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victorias displays at the authorities without a result and also from their relatives, she received no support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">It led a process against her former partners that developed into a troubled legal struggle between Paraguay and their native country, where it mainly went about money, power and the influence of their former partner.</seg>
<seg id="2525">Paraguay laws: good approach, deficient implementation</seg>
<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay, there are many laws, which are very good, but not applied.</seg>
<seg id="2527">The display of abuse is a way of resistors and a fight against corruption in the judiciary, "says Victoria Santos.</seg>
<seg id="2528">Carmen Echauri, a representative of UN organization for women in Paraguay, also sees great problems in the application of laws in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016, a bill was discussed under the hashtag # PorEllas (# FÃ¼ry) under the hashtag # PorEllas (# FÃ¼ry).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the Movement # NiUnaMenos (# NoninveWendel) are part of a campaign on Twitter which is supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original design of the law stipulates that Femizid would declare to explain and hardening as it is already in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Accordingly, the bill was modified in some points, in order to admit the MPs to the law that the way for the criminalization of abortions, which currently banned in Paraguay, and be punished by up to five years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original bill was provided, most of the (bureaucratic and economic) process cost, who have to bear the victims of violence themselves, if they just need to accuse it and secure a safe accommodation to relocate the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argued that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient financial resources.</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, mistreation is seen as part of human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Here, a change must take place, so violence is no longer considered something.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Whoever swiss in view of these facts, it is guilty and contributes to the perpetrators of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2538">We have to talk so long, to misuse, not more than normal.</seg>
<seg id="2539">However, on 10 November 2016, the Law was approved in the paraguan Senate. previously, parts of the law was modified, among other things, a passage in cases of domestic violence to reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The opinions about the changes are apart.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The section regarding the reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggressor to attack his victims.</seg>
<seg id="2542">The cancellation of the words "gender," "political power" and "sexual harassment" from parts of the law is true as a big setback.</seg>

<seg id="2546">"this website was blocked due to a decision of the Ministry of Information," referring to the Forbidden Newspaper Azamn.</seg>
<seg id="2547">More than one year ago, the oman authorities have closed the independent Arab-speaking newspaper Azamn because of their coverage of corruption in the sultan.</seg>
<seg id="2548">Yousef Al-Haj, one of the editors of the newspaper, is still in prison where he has banned one year of imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2549">Two other editors of Azamn, Ibrahim Al-Maamari and Zaher Al-Abri, were also arrested and placed before the court, however, were later restored.</seg>
<seg id="2550">Oman has reigns since 1970 by Sultan Qabus ibn Said who came to power after he had sworn to his father, Said ibn Taimur.</seg>
<seg id="2551">Since then, in addition to his role as the only Sultan, the most important offices in the country: Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Foreign Minister, President of the Supreme Council, and President of the Central Bank.</seg>
<seg id="2552">The Sultan's reign is characterized by the efforts of security forces, in particular by the domestic mystery, including press freedom, limitations and human rights defenders, independent journalists, blogger and other activists, intimidate and incarcerating.</seg>
<seg id="2553">Authorities restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights systematically and activists, to emphasize their views on the public affairs of the country, such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online as well as offline.</seg>
<seg id="2554">The attack on the Azamn newspaper, its closure and closing arguments of three of their editors in the last year is a hard blow for the press freedom in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2555">Azamn is an independent newspaper which has been reported on corruption in Oman (an absolute monarchy since its inception in 2007, until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2556">On 28 July 2016, security forces Ibrahim Al-Maamari, Chief Editor of Azamn, was published an article entitled "High-ranking parties" hands of justice. "it went to corruption in the judicial authorities and the mixture of high-level officials.</seg>

<seg id="2561">On 9 August 2016, the ISS gave the deputy chief editor of Yousef Al-Haj, who was arrested as Chief Editor after Al-Maamaris arrest.</seg>
<seg id="2562">The newspaper was closed at uncertain time after the information Secretary had given the order that, "the publication and dissemination of the newspaper on every way, including online, as of August 9, 2016."</seg>
<seg id="2563">On 26 September 2016, the first trial proceedings against Al-Maamari, Al-Haj and Al-Abri took place before the Court of Masking.</seg>
<seg id="2564">The court sentenced three journalists to the prison penalties and ordered the final closing of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2565">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were both convicted for lack of public order, "abuse of the Internet" and "trench of the Prestature of the State."</seg>
<seg id="2566">Al-Haj was not found in addition to the violation of an audience of publication and slanders.</seg>
<seg id="2567">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj was sentenced to three years of penalties and fines at altitudes of 3000 oman Rial (7800 US dollars), and a one-year professional forbation was imposed on both journalists.</seg>
<seg id="2568">Al-Abri was sentenced to a year jail and a fine of 1000 Rial (2600 US dollars), after using the use of a information network for spreading material that could represent a danger for public order. "</seg>
<seg id="2569">For Al-Abri, a damage deposit of 5000 oman Rial (13 000 US dollars) was established and released on 22 August 2016 before the judgment of the prison.</seg>
<seg id="2570">On 26 December 2016, the Appeals Court acquitted Al-Abri, however, sentenced Al-Haj to a year and Al-Maamari to six months in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2571">Al-Maamari was released on 10 April 2017, after the outpouring of his six-month prison sentence from the central prison in Maskat. al-Haj is still in prison where he has banned his sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2572">The Appeals Court also lifted the decision of the Ministry of the Ministry to conclude the newspaper "Azamn."</seg>
<seg id="2573">In spite of the decision of the court, Azamn again, the newspaper looks like attacks against attacks by the Iranian government.</seg>

<seg id="2575">On 8 May 2017, the Ministry of Information personally signed a further statement in which the closure of "Azamn" was extended by three additional months, and that the minister turned again against the decision of the Appeals Court to retire the publication of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2576">The ongoing closure of Azamn and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where Oman at the youngest time was injured.</seg>
<seg id="2577">For example, the closure of the site of the independent magazine Mowatin and the exercise of pressure on the Albalad, the first independent online newspaper in the country, will stop its operation.</seg>
<seg id="2578">Due to the ongoing closing of Azamn and the arrest of journalists Al-Haj, the impression that the oman authorities are still not willing to prepare an end to the extensive violation of the press freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2579">The Gulf Centre for Human Rights (Gulf Centre for Human Rights, GCHR) calls on the Ottoman authorities to:</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warriors 2016 in Zambia, is carried out with his understanding</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is only rare or not mentioned in the media. this is a growing range that addressed one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for that on site, there are two reasons: for a lack of global health, many medicines and vaccines that cover the special medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Disease such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have in the poorest countries of Africa far more serious consequences than elsewhere, and lack of investments in research by pharmacies are a big problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Secondly, research, which is carried out by African scientists, is helping to develop own research capacity in Africa. a major role of science and technology can only be eligible for economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warriors is Director of the Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in the 1990s in Lusaka, Zambia, just as the AIDS epidemic showed the first serious impact on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As Postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he studied himself on HIV-virus, before he decided to go back home to support the samic healthcare system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warriors discussed about the future of medical research in Zambia and concerning misunderstanding of the media about these research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(Disclaimer: Dr. Warriors speaks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warriors RW: at the moment the focus of my work on the application of research results. I support the samic national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">In addition, I just start a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">Gv: what are the most important scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there are no basic research. we only rely on solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This has to change, otherwise we will always be your recipient instead of being Macher.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions that we get, are often not applicable in our environment, and sometimes it is impossible to use them here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">Gv: where does funding and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How simple or difficult is it to find appropriate researchers for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are well funded differently.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who come back or go here, because financing and development chances are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Gv: how is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What obstacles are there in your routine research work that you haven't had previously?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: basic infrastructure does not correspond to standards in developed countries. it costs much money to have continuous supply with electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive, and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">Gv: how is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there are already interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would propose that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Gv: how large is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should they focus on, and how can we support the development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I've seen great students of all age classes.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There are demand for special scientific training, starting from every age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, research of the space, health care (non-transferable and infectious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Gv: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as scientists in Africa compared to Western countries, based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often there are limited speed, things to do, and the full access to scientific expertise, which represent challenges here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system that magazines are only accessible for payment (the so-called "Paywall"), also limited the amount of available information and speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: like "Open Source" seed producers to change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This article by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the Ensia.com website, a magazine that provides solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton breed already in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">His company offers 114 varieties, such as Outredress, the first plant cultivated by NASA astronauts in space and has been consumed.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, Morton's work was only given through its own simplification and the question how many varieties of salts can be set.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more salads were patented, and that it could not be used for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents are not only for individual varieties, but also for certain properties like resistance to diseases, a special rotor or rudled leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past years, more of such patents have been filed for more and more plants such as grain or cartographers. due to this trends, plant breeders, environmenters and expert food security concerns the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition, Morton still revolutionized morton, but he needs more and more, since its work is still worth the limits.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it is, than in a river a rock slipped, in order to get off." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">So we have to make it right now, but it is a break with breeding tradition, "says he." I think that these patents will go far too far.</seg>
<seg id="2638">And when it stops before court, no one can breeding more of new salads, because all the features are already patented. "he makes it as good as possible and tried to breeding those traits, which he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, he is very careful and labelled to use no material that is protected as a spiritual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">In addition, he is also connected to a movement that will always be bigger in the US and anywhere in the world: open source Breeding ("Open Source").</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have red RÃ¶mersalat of the Sorte Outredress at the "greenhouses' of the station and eaten. there we have been tested if plants can be cultivated in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It's no coincidence that this name rather sounds as sounds like the movement from the IT sector and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for "open-source" seeds) can be inspired by the movement for free "open source" software, which provides alternatives to copyright protected software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was launched to life in order to ensure that some plant species and gene are not fully protected as a spiritual property and are suitable for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, called Ossi, you can undertake US breeders that others can use them free from them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">This does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it. "open Source" breeders allow only others to breathe in to make their own varieties, and it will not be able to destroy them - two aspects that are prohibited by many plant patties or prescribed by many plants.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its start in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Whispered views</seg>
<seg id="2650">Professor for emeritus status of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi board member Jack Kloppenburg are control of the seed and the opportunity to breeding new plants, both important for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seeds plays a role in larger cohesion such as biodiversity, rights of the peasants, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little more by using seed with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">"" "Kloppenburg emphasizes the" "" "open-source" "" "movement does not work with genetically modified plants." ""</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture, and Monsanto and Bayer, who is offered in August or September 2016, should also know that the way is being produced on the farm markets, should also know that the way is cultivated as such vegetables is threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">Dietary sovereign without seed sovereign is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative undertake to ensure that their seed may continue to be freely available. in contrast, their anticipation is to be patented in contrast, seed and plant features.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo of Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi Supporer argued that the future of food supply is endangered because the available gene pool is due to the always more numerous intellectual property rights on plant material, which is therefore always restricted, ineffable shrinking.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, executive director of Ossi, has engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation for carrots and their availability. it found that approximately one-third of all boxes are protected as intellectual property, which is not suitable for plant breeders either not or not worthy.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants there are not such estimates, but experts like Luby means that massacres, as wheat in even larger style can be patented as salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of visual identity</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are so farmed that they have targeted specifically features - from such that their taste or their colour is improving up to such as they thrives in certain environments such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents in plant characteristics indicate that the available plant material for breeders increases by increasingly more patents. genetic diversity is currently more needless than ever before, since the changing conditions are worse predicted by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto-speaking Carly Scaduto announce that genetic diversity is generally important and also key for Monsantos activities. with a total of four combanks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States set itself the company for the maintenance of genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">However, it contradicts the view that spiritually owned other breeding cabinets, as "patents and the protection of plant varied innovation." a patent is basically taken, a plan that everyone can follow, as soon as the patent has expired.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come with another method to the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Such a protection has not inhibits innovations, but promotes it by the public more material and know-how. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton looks different: 20 years to wait until a patent strap is certainly no innovations.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if it is so long to wait for plants that have been adapted to plants, they have already lost the fight.</seg>
<seg id="2669">But the main argument of morton is that genetic resources must always be a general well and there should continue to remain: "independent plant breeders have neither the time nor money for such formalities, and monetric incentives are not attractive for us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to make farmers work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">That is what drives us, and it is impossible to use us if we are not able to use the best and latest genetic resources. "</seg>
<seg id="2672">In total, Morton can be patented on the concept of themselves, vegetable features: "we are creating the characteristics of itself.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form them itself and as breeders, we ultimately have no idea how the plants do that.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeding in the US State Oregon and Ossi Executive Board, there is still another important aspect of the plant breeding: "who breeding a care, and breeding his own values in them.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believes in industrial agriculture with large farms and monoculture believes that cultivating herbicides are needed, breeding in his varieties of this concept.</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is contrary to exactly. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized enterprises (such that move on international markets, but smaller than e.g. Monsanto have) patents, creating the most smaller seed companies, even without patents, they refuse to be very expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both are the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeders Frank Morton is looking for its breeding garden Salads.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo of Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton is also the view that breeders would be innovative by the Avoid of plant patrons: "it looks like that I was able to produce something new in my efforts to make something new, the company that patented.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I need a new material for my catalog, since I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a few years itself, "says he." with a patent is being protected for 20 years before competition, where you simply make it very nice. "global resonance</seg>
<seg id="2683">Although the US seems to be leader in the "Open Source" breeding, the concept spreads very quickly around the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Agriculture"), which itself describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources, is a "open-source" seed program works in the center with farmers, helping them breeding new varieties that meet particular requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them to come to "Open Source" seeds and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">The German organization Agreements works on an "open-source" license which ultimately became a formal and legally binding form of Ossi's commitment to breeders in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2687">(rules for the breeding shall differ from country to country, but because Ossi obligation can not just be taken over one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">In early November 2016, the executive board of the European Union, the European Commission declared that conventionally farmed plants should not be patisable. thus, it speaks against the present practice of the European Patent, the patents are allowed in conventional plants.</seg>
<seg id="2689">However, a declaration is not yet a law; now it is to the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line.</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos organized a conference on "Open Source" seeds and representatives of governments, non-governmental organizations and seed companies from all over East Africa to learn something about the "Open Source" seed movement and the global trend for sponsorship of seeds.</seg>
<seg id="2691">"" "Willy Douma, responsible for" "" "Open Source" "" "program for" "" "Open Source" "" "that the organization is currently planning a worldwide alliance for" "" "open source" "" "Open Source" "" "for the scheduled next year." ""</seg>
<seg id="2692">A merger from environmental protection and development groups (including Hivos, the international non-profit development organization USC Canada and the action group on erosion, Technology and Concentration) has put together a database to seeds and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map.</seg>
<seg id="2693">In September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the Global Alliance for the Future of Essential - a Verbund of aid organisations such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others - publishes a report. it represents the possibility that farmers have to come and improve seed policy to ensure that a stable supply can be ensured with food products.</seg>
<seg id="2694">In the report it is emphasised the importance of a varied, local supply with seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection between the Ossi by Ossi hoping that soon more people will recognize him.</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the latest goals of the censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">Still unlock the Egyptian authorities content on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a column.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of 05.August the Egyptian government locked up the website of the German Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world, and reports on independent reports.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the network released a statement on Facebook which criticized the Egyptian authorities for this step sharp and promised to continue the work and efforts of human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The German Network for Human Rights Information Stay in spite of this attack and the constitution of the Egyptian law and the Constitution to defend this goal, so it was never so important to escape these goals and not to be so important. ANHRI has confirmed that all technical options have been exhausted to overcome the blocking of the earth and not to admit. we wait waiting to meet our task.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered the first censored web organisation in Egypt after the authorities block the independent News page MADA Masr, an Arab-language issue of Huffington Post and the Al Jazeera network of Al Jazeera due to alleged terrorism. "</seg>

<seg id="2728">Besides ANHRI, there is no access to the blog of the column and human rights abducers Ahmed Gamal Ziada.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada took his blog for the spreading of column and articles that he is not available in Egypt for free websites and media.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog, whom he set up in order to avoid the enigration of the Egyptian government, even the goal of attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger who is located at the name of Ziada blog, however, is further accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photo journalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity, after being reported by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while he reported on the student protests, and recorded a video like the police force against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His article turn mainly for politics and human rights in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada said to the plaza through the government and reflecting what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">However, blogs to lock is very old, however, has been priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and even if the rejection of the blogs could not be meaningfully for the world, it is for me there for two reasons:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It is succeeded to mediate me the feeling of a siege management; An arrest, a superiority, forcharge at the National Security Council, the rejection of blogs and any other website I worked for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proven that I did not wrote in vain. in other words, my words have influence, if only on a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First, I used it to the post of articles to deal with the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">But now, after they have blocked him, and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The bays go up to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (AFTE) locked Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06 August 133 websites. this result of technical tests in networks of various Internet Service Provider (ISP), among others Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">AFTE also documented the blocking of providers by using Internet-sur and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in their research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12th we started how the wave of websites that VPNs began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">A such practice indicates the intention of the government to block contents, continue to block contents and have to access the Egyptian users.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The situation will bring additionally the situation to be taken behind closed doors, thereby reducing the Egyptian population has no legal basis, so that the Egyptian population may not proceed against this actions.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the censorship and who will attack them next?</seg>

<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist declared that it is according to the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro and 843 territories, which will be controlled by criminal organizations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial, the newspaper writes:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We aware that a war discretion, if it is distorted, also to be used, impoverishment of the police, which only shoot and then issues to deceive.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose aim is not the civilian population, but the economic power of mafia and their partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the name "War" be used more than they?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the News Portal The Intercept Brasil argued the journalism in CecÃ­lia Oliveira, the violence as "War". this is due to justifiable security policy through the media and could make it difficult to withdraw responsibility for the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>

<seg id="2811">The Direction of the Project, Subway Nabil, said about the French News Agency AFP:</seg>
<seg id="2812">"we opted for the cultivation of mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because they can plant them into houses and cellars."</seg>

<seg id="2834">Two and forty people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires between 15 and 16 October. this led the government last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Fires were also registered in the Galizien region, where there were 4 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 fives, which spread themselves in the northern and central regions of the country, about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">In June, PedrÃ³gÃ£o Grande occurred a similar tragedy in PedrÃ³gÃ£o Grande, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured.</seg>
<seg id="2838">According to the European forestry system, which monitors the forest areas via satellite, in 2017 alone, about 500,000 acres of forest are burned - an area of the size of the Lisbon district.</seg>
