that is James R@@ isen .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as the New York Times repor@@ ter .
long before someone heard of Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book written in which he had spectacular the N@@ SA illeg@@ phones by Americans .
but there is another chapter that should leave a permanent impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astroph@@ ic U.S. intelligence operation , which the CIA was literally &quot; literally &quot; to a nuclear bomb .
if that sounds crazy , please read it .
it &apos;s an incredible story .
but do you know who did not feel the chapter ?
the US government .
for almost 10 years the government had been min@@ ed against rats and ur@@ ged him to call his alleged sources .
in this train , he became a symbol of the pattern of government to condemn W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower and journalists .
according to the first constitu@@ tional@@ ity , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right if media is not able to protect these information and cannot protect them identity of the mu@@ zzle .
so when the government was anchor in R@@ isen , he did something that had many bra@@ ve repor@@ ter already before him , and he refused to go to prison .
from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen lived with the risk to go into prison .
but then , just days before the trial , something unusual .
suddenly , although for years , it would be indisp@@ ens@@ able for their case , the government &apos;s demands were dropped to R@@ isen .
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring , the repor@@ ter and sources can always hide less .
instead of fail@@ ing and to bring down to statements , this also could do its digital foot@@ steps for him .
and so , the investig@@ ators , without his understanding , wor@@ ried about his telephone numbers ,
just like its e @-@ mail data , financial and banking information , its lending service , and even travel information with the list of its flights .
in the midst of these information , they found evidence they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling , a CIA @-@ wound and cra@@ w@@ ed source .
unfortunately , that is only one of many cases .
President Obama spoke in his presence of safegu@@ ards W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower . but instead , the j@@ udi@@ ci@@ ary has been sentenced to more than all US governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how to be a problem , especially because the government is too much of her work as secret .
as of September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of that a W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower came to a journalist .
so we put the press work at the game which is protected by the first constitu@@ tional@@ ity because the government has always has more possibilities to express all out .
but just as technology of the government allowed to manage the rights of repor@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources better .
and though they are able to contact the moment , in which they can contact , instead of the neigh@@ bors , in the case of witness .
today , there is communication software that has not yet been written as a isen book , and it is much more safe than normal e @-@ mails or telephone calls .
such technology is Secure@@ Drop , an open source report for W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the world &apos;s Internet , which was developed by us from the Freedom of the Press Foundation , which I have been working successfully .
rather than to send an e @-@ mail , go to a news site , such as the Washington Post here .
there you may instantly upload documents or send documents , like at each ordinary contact form .
these will then be encrypted and stored on a server , which only has access to the relevant News Agency .
so the government cannot explain more information , and many of the information that would like to request would not be available .
Secure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole thing to protect the press freedom in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments of all over the world have always been developing new sp@@ y technologies which are all end@@ anger@@ ed .
it &apos;s to ensure that not only technology denom@@ in@@ ator such as Edward Snow@@ den have a way to give ini@@ quities . it is so important that we protect the next wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower ,
the lack of abuse during the supply of soldiers knows how to report and of over@@ crow@@ ded hospitals . or the next environmental workers , the alarm to be missed water by Fl@@ int . or a pilgrimage in@@ sider that war@@ ns us before the next financial crisis .
after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to un@@ cover crimes , but to protect our constitu@@ tional@@ ity .
thank you .
&#91; on April 3 , 2016 the biggest data base of the story was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; reveal that the kingdom and M@@ igh@@ ty &#93; have been hid in tax bub@@ bles . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness , a declaration of 11 million records in Panama &apos;s legal law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ se@@ ca
the publication of these documents provides a small insight into the secret world of tax bub@@ bles .
we get an impression of what customers , banks and lawyers are going to go to companies such as Mos@@ sack Fon@@ se@@ ca and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you do that ? &quot;
we really see the emails , the exchange of messages , as the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to its very direct consequences .
Iceland Prime Minister is re@@ signed .
also there are reports that a federation of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ators Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad had op@@ pressed companies in tax ha@@ v@@ ases .
it is alleged that a trace of 2 billions of US dollars to Russia &apos;s President Vladimir Putin will lead over a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous C@@ elli@@ sts .
now there will be there a lot of rich people and others that wait any nerv@@ ous to the next release , and to the next release documents .
now that sounds like the plot of a agencies or a John @-@ Gr@@ ish@@ am @-@ ROM .
it seems , cri@@ es away from you , ordinary people .
why should we take this ?
but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax bub@@ bles and not all their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and that affects us all .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these re@@ vel@@ ations are phenom@@ enal .
in all over the world , media and leading politicians , such as secret tax@@ ies are used to hide and swal@@ low them -- something that we have been discuss@@ ing and reveal their assets for ten years .
I think of many people all the world will be very conf@@ using , and it &apos;s difficult to understand how this tax ha@@ v@@ ases work .
I &apos;ll always stand there as a Mat@@ ry@@ osh@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe in front of me .
so one company has a company in another company , in another company which makes it almost impossible to understand , really who behind these bones .
it may be very difficult to understand the prosecution and tax authorities , as well as journalists or civil society really understand what thing is .
I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports about this matter in the United States .
presumably , because there have been no prominent Americans that were present in these re@@ vel@@ ations , this sc@@ and@@ al .
now it is not so that there is no rich Americans that hide their assets in tax bub@@ bles .
but by the principle , after which this tax ha@@ v@@ ases work , Mos@@ pack Fon@@ se@@ ca has less American customers .
if we have the Cay@@ man Islands , or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming , or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections in the USA .
indeed , it is so that you need to specify fewer information in some US @-@ states to establish a company as to obtain a company library .
this type of in@@ transparent in the USA has allowed employees to zo@@ omed to school children .
it is permitted to capture especially vulner@@ able investors .
it is this sort of behavior , which affects us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness , we &apos;ll need to figure out how all this is in practice .
how does it work ?
thus we sent a covered investigations into the offices of 13 offices in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator gave himself an African minister , who wanted to bring susp@@ ects money into the USA to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
we really sho@@ cked that everyone to an advoc@@ ate of our investig@@ ator did , as he could transfer his money .
these were all pre@@ ferences . no one of these lawyers received us as clients , and of course there was no man handed over to the money . however , it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important to consider this not as individual cases .
it does not work for a single advoc@@ ate who has submitted an investig@@ ator to our own investig@@ ator .
it is not about a single peak pol@@ iti@@ que , wrapped in a sc@@ and@@ al .
it is because the system works through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability .
and in order to handle this , we must change the rules .
we have to change the rules to make this type of behavior .
that &apos;s all very b@@ lowing , as if we could do anything about it ; as if it had nothing ever changed ; as if it is always the rich and the mighty one will give it .
but as a bor@@ row@@ ly optimal , I see that lot has started to change .
in the last few years we have seen forward to more transparency , aff@@ ecting the owners of companies .
the topic found political attention by the British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
since then the EU has recorded into central regi@@ sters at the national level , who really is behind companies in Europe , and who controls them .
one of the un@@ pleasant facts is that the US is left behind .
representatives of both parties have one of the bill into two parliamentary chambers , but this does not make progress that we would like to see .
we would really like to see how this Panama re@@ vel@@ ies , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ases , is used to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for changes .
we need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind those companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need managers in the business that rise , saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ transparent is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we need the leading politicians that recognize the problem and finish in it by laws to termin@@ ate this type of in@@ transparent .
together , we can finish the in@@ transparent , which now allows this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ wear .
this is the story , as I was almost kidn@@ apped and in the boot space of a red Maz@@ das would have landed .
one day after I completed my designer , I made a back@@ yard .
a type in red Maz@@ da stayed there and looked at my things .
he bought one of my art works .
he was in the city alone and made just a road journey through the whole country . afterwards he would go to the Peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me that he would change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; where do you sleep today ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing even worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I thought : Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just knew him now ! he says he would go to the peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really is planning . I don &apos;t have ab@@ duc@@ ted the boot space of a Maz@@ das !
this is a small boot space !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard my saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , how to pray ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the night I was in bed , I star@@ ed on the ceiling and thought : &quot; Oh man ! what have I broken up ?
a wild sleeping sleeps in my living room .
what if he is crazy ? &quot;
I got a anxi@@ ety that I got out of the bed to shut up on ti@@ thes at the door , and closed my bedroom door .
but he was not crazy .
we are still in contact .
the artwork , which he had purchased from me , is now on his class@@ rooms . he is now teachers .
that was my first experience as host . it has changed my eye @-@ angle completely .
perhaps people who have been sold out of childhood in childhood , actually friends who had been waiting to be discovered only on it ?
people can accom@@ o@@ date people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattress .
let &apos;s make a leap years , two years later ...
I &apos;m unemployed , almost ple@@ ite , my roomm@@ ates , and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity is able to transform it in fun for fun .
I wrote my best friend and new roomm@@ ates Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I have over@@ laid something like us . our apartment will come to a designer @-@ bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk included , with a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a site and established the &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast . &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors .
they loved it , and we also was .
I &apos;m sure our cheese @-@ ham O@@ mel@@ et tast@@ ed completely different because we made it for our guests .
we t@@ oured with them through the whole city . when we fell to our last guest and fell the door to the castle , Brian got the Brian and I joined us .
had we just discovered that we could find out new friends at the same time ?
things came to the rolling .
my former roomm@@ ates , n@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ c@@ zy@@ k , joined us as developer .
we &apos;ll need to figure whether to make it a business concept .
so we presented to the investors : &quot; we want to create a website , in the people publicly available images of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms that doors you pass when visiting .
over the Internet you can then invite you to stay wild people with them .
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited that the miss@@ ile might be ign@@ ited .
but she did not .
no one who is yet with consol@@ ation , would invest in a business that allowed strangers to sleep in flats of other people .
why ?
because as children have learned all , strangers are dangerous .
if one has a problem , you indicate the things you can do well . we were designed to design .
in the Academy of Fine Arts , we learned that design is much more than just appearance and h@@ ap@@ tics -- it is the total experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create trust between people who had never met before .
can design be done so ?
is it possible to create trust with its design ?
I would like to give you a sample sample , which degrees trust we increase .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will be out of your Com@@ for@@ tz@@ one .
thum@@ bs up , if you are ready .
take your mobile phone in your hand .
now I would like to un@@ lock your mobile phone .
enter your un@@ locking cell phone your left seat .
this quiet an@@ flug of pan@@ ic , which you will feel -- -- is exactly what hosts will feel the first time to open the door .
for the only thing that is still personal as your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your text , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to keep the un@@ locked cell phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most will feel the responsibility .
so , most guests will feel if they spend anywhere else .
only for this reason , our company may exist .
so , who actually has Al Go@@ res &apos;s mobile now ?
could you say on Twitter so that he is responsible for the Office of the President ?
you can now return the phones now .
you have now experienced what kind of confidence we want to build . I would like to tell you some discover@@ ies .
what if we have changed a small detail in this experiment ?
what if your neigh@@ bor would have presented itself once with his name ; if he would have told how he does , like his dog or his children ?
imagine you have 150 convic@@ tions which say all , &quot; he can really get very well locked out mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel when you should leave your mobile phone ?
because a well @-@ thought feedback system strengthens trust in confidence .
at the beginning , we did not make some things wrong .
it was difficult for people to aband@@ on negative evidence .
ultimately , we decided to wait until both host and guest had submitted their findings before we put them online .
last week we have discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how probably it is that people trust one another , depending on how they are similar to age and residential area .
little sur@@ pris@@ ingly we trust the people most , which are most similar .
the more differences we find , the less confidence we .
this is a natural social Vo@@ coder .
exciting , if one adds to the call of a person -- in our case through Be@@ ess@@ ments .
if you have less than three divisions , nothing changes .
but if one has more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation of common simil@@ ar@@ ities from .
the right design can help us to overcome some of our deep roots .
Moreover , we drove that trust depends on how much man is available .
here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if one tells us how &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t get no answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one gets too much , such as : &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request is not yet accepted .
so there is an optimal degree of op@@ enn@@ ess , such as &quot; T@@ olle works of art in your dwelling place ! I have been doing with my family vacation . &quot;
how can I create it with design to make this degree of off@@ ence ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text . we also give tips on which topics you should write something .
our whole company builds on hope that the right design can help to overcome our approach to strangers .
with which we had not counted , the great multitude of people who were more than ready to have this incident .
here you can see how many people take our offer .
one can recognize three things .
first : incredible good luck .
second : the un@@ ti@@ reless work of our team .
third : a need that had not been covered before .
for us the shop is very good .
of course , there are also times if it &apos;s not running smoothly .
there were guests who celebrated un@@ admitted parties or apartments were devast@@ ated .
hosts will have guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the front front when trust was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it is already hurt when I think only .
the dis@@ appointment of listening to the voice of the call@@ ers , and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve us .
lu@@ ck@@ ily , there had only a fra@@ ction of 123 million guest@@ nights , only one fra@@ ction .
for people trusted in one another .
if trust works , the mira@@ cul@@ ous works can be created .
one of our guests took vacation in Uruguay . he suffered a heart attack there .
his hosts drove him to the hospital .
he donated blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect house for trav@@ ellers who tend to heart attack due to their activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with adequate hospitals .
Javier and Ale@@ j@@ and@@ ra are real f@@ ails to save a life although they don &apos;t know correctly .
you drive one in your own car to the hospital when you die , and wait , while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want to feel lon@@ ely , they bring books over .
you can even stay longer without charge the extra @-@ nights .
I only recommend it ! &quot;
thus , of course not running any stay .
but these relations behind pure money reaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share economy .
for the first time I went over this term , I asked myself :
how does the thought work together with money transactions ?
it is about a economic trade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but just simply &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to call the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will not just be justified . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
share Economy describes a trade show that promises human relationships .
people create a part of itself , and this changes everything .
when you travel nowadays , it is efficient and reliable , but it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
what if travelling a rich buffet from local in@@ press ?
what would be if you visited a group there , a group to wait there , to fill a thoroughly and one with a bar of a quarter , one of which one has never heard ;
or if you can cook in a five star chef ?
today , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would like to make apartments of reason to share ?
what would that look like ?
what would be if cities would have to participate in the idea ?
I come to me cities that enable us society and relationships , instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and am@@ id@@ ling .
in South Korean capital Seoul , this project started already . lots of parking places , which belonged to the government ,
residents offered in search of a lead , were offered in search of a lead ,
were medi@@ ated to people whose children were pulled out . they were incub@@ ators were incub@@ ators ,
to start new start@@ ups in the Share economy . over our platform alone , 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries are being invited to a stranger , or even hosts .
the idea seems to be so crazy about how it was brought to us .
we did not re@@ invented the wheel .
we also gave it before .
there were similar websites before us .
so why did our work ?
in addition to happiness and tim@@ ing , we realized that you can find out the right design with the components of confi@@ denti@@ ality .
design can help us to overcome deep@@ est gu@@ ardi@@ ans .
I think it &apos;s amazing ,
deserv@@ ed great .
I have to think about it once , when a red Maz@@ da starts on me .
we know of course that design can &apos;t solve any problem .
but if it could help us if it had this great impact , I wonder what design would be coming soon .
thank you .
what do you think when you watch me ?
a believers ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed , a dec@@ eption , under@@ go a terror ist ?
or simply a delay at the airport on the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you the fault for your negative impressions .
so the media represent such as I look like .
a study revealed that 80 % of the coverage of Islam and Muslims are negative .
studies show : American my , most would not know any Muslims .
presumably the people are not speaking with their U@@ ber drivers .
for all those who have never experienced a Muslims : it is great , you know .
I tell you who I am .
I &apos;m a mother , a coffee maker -- twice es@@ presso , with whi@@ pped cream extra .
I am ver@@ ted ,
a Mö@@ ven@@ ding @-@ Fitness @-@ Fan@@ ati@@ ker@@ in ,
and I &apos;m a practic@@ ing , spiritual Muslims .
but not as Lady G@@ aga s@@ ings , for , baby , I was not born .
I decided it .
when I was 17 , I met the decision to ou@@ sted me .
no , not as a hom@@ osexual man , like some of my friends , but as Muslims . I decided to wear Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head .
my femin@@ ist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; why did you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot;
the L@@ ust@@ ige was : that time it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , namely , opposite the pressure that I felt as a 17 @-@ year @-@ old , I felt a perfect and un@@ achiev@@ able beauty ideal .
I have not only received the faith of my parents .
I have del@@ ays with the grain .
I read it , thought , thought in question , doub@@ ted and believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
she was trust and slow commitment to cover themselves with each reading of the Kor@@ an .
sometimes the beauty of the rhythm brings me to the weeping .
I know myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
did you ever feel the feeling that someone doesn &apos;t perc@@ eive you completely , and loves somehow ?
it feels like that .
later I married and began , like all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineering .
I later had a child after my marriage , a child , and lived in the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American dream . &quot;
then came the terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember , where they were there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I sat in my kitchen , had ended up at the end , looking onto the screen and saw the &quot; Eil@@ &quot; &quot; message &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was smoke , air@@ crafts in buildings , people sp@@ un out of buildings .
what was this ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock turned into indig@@ nation quickly .
why should I do so ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I changed the television channel and heard : &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terror@@ ists ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Ji@@ had ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oh , my God .
it is not just my country , but in the N@@ u related me the deeds of others from a civil society in susp@@ ects .
on the same day we had to go through the Middle West of the USA to move into a new city and to start with the post@@ graduate course .
I remember , as I was silent -- as we were silent -- as deep it went into my seat , and I was afraid that I was afraid of the Muslims .
we moved to our apartment in this night , in a new town , in which it felt like a completely different world .
and then , I saw , and read the war@@ nings of the National islam@@ ic organisations which said , &quot; Be careful , &quot; Be careful , &quot; lead in well illuminated areas , &quot; says you not . &quot;
I stayed the whole week inside .
then it was Friday that week -- the day when Muslims gathered to gather Muslims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again , the war@@ nings : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not work on this first Friday , the mosque might be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I saw me the extensive reporting .
the feelings of feelings were in@@ filtr@@ ated and I heard of attacks on Muslims or by people who stayed for Muslims in free and struck down .
there was really bran@@ ching on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something felt not feeling right .
because people who attacked this country have attacked our country .
I turned the rage of people on the terror@@ ists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to explain himself .
I have nothing about questions , I love questions .
there are acc@@ us@@ ations which are hard .
today , we can really hear people : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it means Muslims .
when will we go on ? &quot;
some people want to join Muslims and mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church as of a tum@@ ours in the body of the USA .
it is only the question : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or am@@ orous ?
they know : a mal@@ icious tumor is removed as a whole and mal@@ icious tumor can only be kept under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is wrong .
Muslims are like all other Americans , no tumor on the body of the United States , but an essential organ .
thanks !
Muslims are Invent@@ ors and Teacher , Er@@ s@@ thel@@ ium and Olympi@@ ad .
will the closure of Mos@@ ques America saf@@ er ?
there may be quite a few parking spaces , but not stop the terror .
the regular visit of a mosque manages to consider people to toler@@ ant people more toler@@ ant and greater part of citizens .
and like me a leader of the police in the Washington coast of Washington , he recently told : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques .
they are radi@@ alized in their cell@@ ars or in bed before a computer .
during the radio process it is found that it begins online . as the first , the person &apos;s person is cut off , even from their family , that the person believes that the person believes that the person believes that the person who believes the true Muslims , and everyone who ab@@ h@@ ates their behaviour and ide@@ ology , is ab@@ dic@@ ated or fallen by faith .
if we want to prevent radic@@ alization , we must stop the people to go to the mosque .
some of them still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS develops their brood @-@ ality with the Kor@@ an .
as Muslims , as a mother , as a man , I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would like to add to their predecess@@ ors , if you recognize them as a representative of 1.6 billion believers .
thanks !
the IS has so much to do with Islam , as the K@@ u @-@ Kl@@ ux cl@@ an interview with Christianity .
both groups claim their ide@@ ology reasons for their &quot; Holy book . &quot;
but when you cast a look at her , she doesn &apos;t drive them in her &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot;
it is their brood @-@ ality that they can read these things into the Scriptures .
an outstanding im@@ am told me an aston@@ ishing story :
a girl came to him because she gave to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him whether they had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said that the problem was exactly the opposite . every spirit , having spoken it , brought them to silence , and told her that their wrath , their sense to un@@ righteousness in the world , would only bring them into difficulties .
nothing inspired and something that had been given to their rage , she was a main goal for instrum@@ ent@@ alisation by extrem@@ ists who spoke a solution .
this im@@ am presented the connection to God and their congregation .
instead of acc@@ use for their rage , he showed her constru@@ ctive way for a real change in the world .
what they met in the mosque , they kept it before to join the IS .
it was an insight , like the Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia myself and my family .
but how does it work on normal Americans ?
how does it work on each other ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear fear every day on our democracy , on our freedom of freedom ?
a study -- actually several neu@@ ros@@ ci@@ enti@@ ous studies -- show : if we fear , we will pass at least three things .
we rather accept a author@@ itarian government system , conformity and advantages .
a study shows : if one reported test individuals , in which negative about Muslims was reported , they were rather military attacks on Muslim countries and the circumcision of American Muslims .
this is not just an academic problem .
if you see when the mood sw@@ apped against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then it happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the ap@@ ron of the Iraq war and during two elec@@ toral periods .
so , Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction on Mos@@ lem @-@ terror , as I expected it .
it can actually be a tool to man@@ ipulation to be public to under@@ take the foundation of a free society that has sen@@ sible and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear fell upon us all .
in the assignment of collective debt , it is not only about to explain himself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple , which lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school .
De@@ ah was an athl@@ ete .
he was at the dental fac@@ ulty , talented , and promising ...
his sister would say to me that he was the most common , generous man , whom they knew .
she visited him there , and he showed her life @-@ run . she was bl@@ oss@@ ess and said :
&quot; when is such a young man from my breasts ? &quot;
just a few weeks after visiting Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and his wife , her neigh@@ bor , Cra@@ ig Stephen H@@ icks , she was murdered , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an who had posted in the afternoon . he did it in her apartment , after taking a post@@ ion against Muslims on his Facebook page .
he shot eight times to De@@ ah .
Fan@@ at@@ ism can not only be mor@@ ally , but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
are we gone to the mosque or we stayed home safely ?
we felt it and for us it was not a light decision , because it was because we would like to check our children in America : one that would control us through fear , or one where we can freely exercise our religion .
we decided to give us for the mosque .
with our son in the children &apos;s seat , we loved it with high pressure to the mosque .
I took him out , my shoes went out , went into the building hall , and what I saw it left me .
the hall was completely filled .
then the Im@@ am made a announcement , than@@ ked , and welcomed our guests , because the half of the gathered Christians were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hist@@ s , ath@@ eist@@ s , believers , and non @-@ believers who came , not to attack us , but to stand for us .
at this moment I have collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had courage and compassion .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose from the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism ?
are you going to go to number ?
or are you join to which my : we are better than those .
thank you .
thank you beautiful !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have met a ner@@ ve .
but I wonder what do you say that you might say that you have a T@@ ED@@ Talk , a monument with deep @-@ pass , thus an exception and not the rule .
what would you say about those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , do not lie down . I &apos;m totally normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I usually have such as it is permitted .
when you look at Muslims all over the world , and I did that with the largest ever carried out on Muslims in all over the world , people want to normal people .
they want prosper@@ ity to the family , they want to work and want to live in peace .
so I &apos;m not an exception in any respect .
if people appear as a rule , then the rule is broken , and they are not the exception to rule .
HW : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists , it stands just before , a billion business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . it is made possible in research institutions around the world .
before air package into our social awareness , a autonomous fleet of aircraft at the Fra@@ c Centre in France has built up a six metres high tower from 1 500 bricks . some years ago they began to fly with rop@@ es .
through connecting cables achieve high speed and acceleration in the smallest space .
you can also build self @-@ loaded structures .
you have lear@@ nt to bear loads with tur@@ bul@@ ences and to react to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of Pos@@ sible flight .
in order to work a system aut@@ om , it must know collec@@ tively , where the mobile objects are located .
in our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic suspension .
for today &apos;s demo@@ s , we use a new loc@@ alization technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , a publisher of our laboratories .
there are no external cameras .
each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in space , calculations on board which should do the machine .
external commands are available at the highest degree e. g. &quot; and &quot; lan@@ den &quot; .
this is a so @-@ called rear starter ,
a plane that tries to beat two flies with a fl@@ ap .
like other starters , it is efficient in the forward flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all its variations .
in contrast to most starters , it can be bo@@ ar , and thus has great advantages at the start and landing , and is very versatile .
but there is always a small side .
a limitation of hed@@ ging is that they react sensiti@@ vely to tur@@ bul@@ ences like wind turbines .
we develop new control and algorith@@ ms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the device does not matter the optimal position , and the achievement can be improved by practic@@ ing .
okay .
during our research , we often introduce fundamental rights issues to enter the nu@@ cle@@ us of the matter .
one such question would be for example : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for this to know the answer to a question .
helicop@@ ters are known about machines with a thousand moving parts that are gathering together to viol@@ ate you .
recently , trained pilots could fly remote control units , which had only two moving parts : a prop@@ ellers and a h@@ edge of the rear .
we discovered that flying with just one works .
this is the Mon@@ osp@@ inner that served mechanically sim@@ pl@@ est flying device . it was invented recently .
it has just a movable part , a propeller ,
no valves , hing@@ es and lateral ru@@ ster , no further gear unit or control surfaces , just a prop@@ ellers .
although it &apos;s mechanically simple , the interior happens very much so it can fly stable and can move in the space .
nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the tail@@ gate . to get there to fly , I must take it exactly right .
the probability of throwing it exactly once all , is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed in the night last night .
when the Mon@@ osp@@ inner is a practice in pleas@@ ures , this machine is the machine here with its eight prop@@ ellers , a practice in over@@ flow .
what to do with all this over@@ flow ?
they see that he is just symmet@@ ri@@ cally .
therefore , he is equivalent to ambi@@ valent in its orientation .
as a result he receives the au@@ dit@@ ory capability ;
to move in the space in all directions , no matter how it is turned or even like he rot@@ ates .
of course it is complex , mainly in the field of interactive rivers of eight prop@@ ellers .
a lot is adjustable in models , the rest is learned directly at the fly .
let &apos;s see that .
when flying machines should be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine consists of two separate two @-@ propeller @-@ aircraft engines .
this rot@@ ates clock@@ wise
and the other toward the clock@@ wise .
if you meet them , they are like a high @-@ performance Quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
however , if somewhat sh@@ ief -- a engine or propeller falls off , the electronics or one battery -- can continue to fly the machine if also limited .
we will be demonstr@@ ating that we are able to make a half air@@ worthy .
the last demonstration examined synthetic s@@ warming .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression .
we took standard micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- every single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and out@@ fit them with loc@@ alis@@ ing technology and algorith@@ ms .
each unit knows where space is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit .
hop@@ efully please make these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine would like to exercise a flying lamp screen at Broadway .
of course it is difficult to predi@@ ct the influence of this technology .
for types like us is the reward in the development and of the activity .
it serves as a memory , as wonderful and hon@@ our@@ able our universe is , and that it is creative , war@@ fs it to form a spectacular fashion .
the fact that this technology has massive industrial and economic potential is the dot on the i .
thank you .
1.3 billion years ago in a very far away galax@@ y , two black holes were increasingly qu@@ icker , they turned the mass three to be in a ten@@ ths of a ten@@ ths of pure energy .
this short moment they ligh@@ tened them brigh@@ ter than all stars in all galax@@ ies of the entire universe .
it was a great Kn@@ all .
but they didn &apos;t put their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy became in the space @-@ time limit itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we arrange the events at first time .
a majority of 1.3 billion years ago was a majority of life on earth .
since then , Earth has been quite different : cor@@ als , fish , plants , sau@@ rier , people and -- God arise for -- even the internet .
about 25 years ago , a group of especially cour@@ age@@ ous -- R@@ ai Weiss , of MIT , K@@ IP Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver of the C@@ alt@@ ech -- to build a huge laser detector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , caused by pl@@ ating black holes .
most held them for crazy .
but enough people recognized them as a mad gen@@ ius , so that the US National Science Foundation financed her idea .
after decades of development , design , concept and extremely much hard work , they super@@ vised the detector L@@ IG@@ O : the laser @-@ inter@@ fer@@ omet@@ ri@@ val Observatory .
in the follow @-@ up time , precision of L@@ IG@@ O was increased significantly , which improved the detection performance enorm@@ ously .
therefore it is called Advanced L@@ IG@@ O .
at the beginning of September 2015 L@@ IG@@ O was launched for a final test run to clari@@ fy some minor , persistent problems .
on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the commissioning of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two col@@ li@@ ating black holes were through the earth through the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hug@@ hes : only two moments in my life were emotional than that :
the Birth of my daughter
and the f@@ arewell was my father &apos;s father .
basically , that was the fruit of my life .
all this , what I worked , is not more science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hug@@ hes , theore@@ tically physi@@ cist at MIT . he has examined over 23 years of gra@@ vit@@ ational waves like L@@ IG@@ O signals . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is an ru@@ ction in the weight of space and time .
when passing through the shaft , the room and its whole content are stretched into a direction , and the other side are over@@ thrown .
to illustr@@ ate do@@ z@@ ers in courses on the theory of rel@@ ativity often you often have a true dance .
&quot; stretching and du@@ sty , stretching and du@@ sty . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves extremely weak , even ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous , are ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous .
on September 14 , for example , each of us was stretched out by us when the waves beat and stri@@ ped . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average human being was 10 high -@@ 21 .
this means 20 zer@@ os after the Kom@@ ma , followed by a 1 . so I declared the L@@ IG@@ O staff for crazy .
with a five kilometer long laser detector , which is already ab@@ sur@@ d , this length would have to be measured on less than a thous@@ and@@ ths of the radius of an atomic nu@@ des . that &apos;s gr@@ ot@@ es@@ k .
at the end of his classic text on grav@@ itation
described K@@ IP Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder L@@ IG@@ Os , the hunt for the waves in the following way : &quot; the technical difficulties when building such detectors are massive .
but physi@@ cist shall be final and with the support of the public , all obstacles are overcome . &quot;
Thor@@ ne has published this in 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to L@@ IG@@ O . Scott claims that L@@ IG@@ O would be more than one eye than one eye .
I want to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavelength , which is much smaller than the things around us : fac@@ tions , the size of your mobile phones .
this is quite practical . for example , you can make a picture or a map of things by taking the light from several points to perc@@ eive around you .
the sounds are different .
audi@@ ble tones have a wavelength of up to 15 meters .
therefore , it is very difficult to produce a picture of things that mean you particularly much :
about the face of your child .
instead , we listen to certain properties like clay and height , rhythm and volume to close to history .
&quot; now it speaks Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob interrup@@ ts them . &quot;
&quot; number Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we can &apos;t make any simple pictures of objects in all .
but by looking forward changes to the ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least , the measured frequencies are at the audi@@ ble range for L@@ IG@@ O .
so when we convert wave pattern into sound , we can literally hear the universe .
the grav@@ itation can listen to us about the coll@@ ision of two black holes when my colleague Scott has already been busy .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , h@@ ubs simple : w@@ up@@ p !
turn the two body very quickly , you hear the same circulation with an additional tone change . sounds like : W@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u !
it is a kind of motion which shaped into the wav@@ e@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I never forget -- heard L@@ IG@@ O : &#91; Sur@@ render of the sound &#93; no one knows what he needs to hear , this as the sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with each 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which are roughly as fast as the bars of your mixer .
AA : superior to us what this means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in all , one with a mass of 29 sh@@ uns , the other with a mass of 36 tons , revol@@ ve each one hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine that forces before .
fantastic .
and we know it because we heard it .
there is the lasting meaning of L@@ IG@@ O .
L@@ IG@@ O eb@@ net a completely new way to explore the universe as it was never before .
on this way we can listen to the all and hear the invisible .
much in all , we can not see -- practically or basically -- .
a super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why mass@@ acres the stars in super nov@@ as .
they are very useful . of them we have lear@@ nt much about the all .
the exciting physical actions occurred but in the core , which is behind thousands kilometres of iron , carbon and silicon hidden .
we will never see where these op@@ ak are .
gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penet@@ rating iron , as it would be transparent glass . the ur@@ ine : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it because the hat@@ ch is covered by his own offspring .
the help of gra@@ vit@@ ational waves should be possible to look at the beginning .
and the most important : I am optim@@ istic that in all things we have never seen that we never seen , and of which we don &apos;t have any idea . things we can only discover by listening .
in fact , L@@ IG@@ O found the first attraction in fact that we did not expect .
my colleague on the MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the L@@ IG@@ O project , says to this topic : me : the kind of stars , the black holes were observed , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies from prehistoric times . the black holes are so to speak the suction cup for our archaeological work .
L@@ IG@@ O enables us to give us a completely different viewing angle on the events in the All , on the emergence of the stars and ultimately how we went out of this chaos .
AA : the challenge is now to be as good as possible .
thanks to L@@ IG@@ O we know how to build a great detectors and listen to the noise and pen of the cos@@ mos .
we need ideas for new ob@@ servat@@ ories -- a brand new generation of hom@@ servat@@ ories at the earth and in all .
for what could I be beautiful than to listen to the ur@@ ine ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thank you .
some time I tried an experiment .
one year I would say to all &quot; Yes ! &quot; I was afraid of whom I feared .
no matter whether it made me nerv@@ ous to say me in un@@ pleasant situations , I forced me &quot; Yes &quot; to say .
will I speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
would I want to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
would I want to start with the scene ?
no , no , no , yes , yes , yes .
and a mad thing happened : exactly that to do , w@@ ov@@ or I feared me , removed my fears .
my fears , talk to spe@@ ech@@ es , my social fear -- Pu@@ ff , gone .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes &quot; my life changed .
&quot; yes &quot; changed .
but there was a particular Yes that changed my life to an un@@ expect@@ edly . it all started with a question of my sheep .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett , and Emer@@ son . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when it would be a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ valu@@ ate , I need milk for my bar@@ um@@ bil@@ l@@ asse &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she asked me if I could play with her when I was just on the go . and I said : &quot; yes . &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
a new life setting in my family . from there I swe@@ ars to play always with them , as soon as you &apos;re doing it , or whatever I go , I say always Yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect but I am tired of it .
it has a magical effect on me , on my children , on our family .
but it also has a bl@@ ossom @-@ effect : just before short , I actually proved that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for playing with my children res@@ cu@@ ed my career . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have a real dream job .
I am author . I think of things , raised to life .
dream job .
no . no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I create TV . I create TV .
I do TV , in large style .
in this TV season , I &apos;m responsible for you to spend 70 hours of programme into the world .
four television programs , 70 hours television . three to four shows are produced at the same time .
each con@@ sign@@ ment provides hundreds of jobs that previously didn &apos;t exist .
the budget for an episode of a television set can be between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
a new episode of four days , four television programs , four television programs , 70 hours TV , three broad@@ casts that are simultaneously in production , once four , 16 episodes : Sc@@ and@@ al , 15 episodes : Sc@@ and@@ al , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Bott@@ om , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours television ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America , my television series are running on Thursday evening .
all over the world , my series are running in 256 languages in 67 different languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are broad@@ casts that I create myself , and not only produced so I have to find time , really cool , creative time to gather my fans the camp@@ fires and tell my stories .
four television series , 70 hours television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires , who burn around the world .
do you know who makes it still ?
no one , therefore I &apos;m a Titan .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to im@@ press you .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I say it , because I know what you think when the word &quot; author &quot; falls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I tell you all of them that work so hard as you can take a company , a country or a class@@ room to take me if I say of work , that I don &apos;t just tell me when I say : I understand that there is no dream about it in a dream job .
it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all swe@@ at -- no tears .
I &apos;m working much , hard and I love it .
when I am deep@@ ened to work , there is no other feeling .
my work creates always a country out of nothing .
it is , when I set up troops , when I painted on a canvas .
as dre@@ aming of a high tone , it &apos;s a marathon .
one feels like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that were at the same time .
I love to work it .
she is creative , mechanically , str@@ en@@ uous and in@@ tox@@ ic@@ uous , clin@@ ically and m@@ ish@@ ly , cruel , and reasonable . and the best of it is the sum@@ s .
there is such a change in me when working .
a bu@@ zz begins in my head , and it grows and growing , and the sum@@ s sounds like a busy street , I could always go to it for ever .
many people assume , if I tell them the sum@@ s , I notice the writing that the writing is ready for me .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , that does it .
but the sum@@ s -- when I began working with the TV production when I started working and work together to create and work together , I discovered this thing , this sum@@ s , this energy . the sum@@ s !
the sum@@ s is more than the writing .
the sum@@ s is action and activity . the sum@@ s is a drug .
the sum@@ s is music . the sum@@ s is light and air .
the sum@@ s is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have a sum , then you can &apos;t go differently than to size .
the feeling doesn &apos;t feel different , than for size , no matter what price .
this is called the sum@@ s .
or perhaps it also means a work@@ piece .
perhaps it means gen@@ ius .
perhaps it is E@@ go .
perhaps it is the fear of a failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I only know that I am not for the failure , and I only know that I love the sum@@ s .
I will only tell you , I &apos;m a Titan , and I know that I don &apos;t want it into question .
to achieve a clear : ever , ever more broad@@ casts , the more details , the more work , the more work is , the more work at the same time , the more about me , the more so I write history so more expectations exist .
the more I work to be successful , the more must work me .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the land , which I create , the marathon , whom I run , the army , the screen , the high tone , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s .
I like this sum@@ s . I love the sum@@ s .
I need the sum@@ s . I am the sum@@ s .
am I only this sum ?
and then the sum@@ s stopped .
revised , ag@@ it@@ ated , ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated , ag@@ ger@@ ated .
the sum@@ s stops .
now my three daughters are acc@@ ust@@ omed to the truth that their m@@ om is an only worker institute .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my m@@ om will not be there , but you can write my n@@ anny . &quot;
and Emer@@ son says : &quot; E@@ valu@@ ate , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da country . &quot;
there are the children of a titanium .
they are Baby @-@ Titan@@ en .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sum@@ s heard .
the sum@@ s of the engine stopped .
I loved my work no more . the engine was off .
the sum@@ s did not return .
my sum@@ s was broken .
I made the same things as always : the same titanium work , 15 hours @-@ day , continuous weekends , no regre@@ t , nothing to deleg@@ ate , a titanium sleep not , with all your heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no sum@@ s .
in me was silence .
four television programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four television programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a show Titan ,
everything was gray , I just had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
all that I did .
I was the sum@@ s and the sum@@ s I was .
so what do you do if you do , work , which one loves , suddenly f@@ ou@@ led ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know , some may think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Heu@@ le you from , bl@@ ö@@ der author Titan &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what you do , you can do to be one teacher , a ban@@ ker to be a teacher , a painter , Bill gates , and knows how to feel the sum@@ s when you knew the sum@@ s , if the sum@@ s stops , who is it then ?
what are you like ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when song of my heart hears , I can survive in silence ?
and then my &quot; South States wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; depic@@ ts a question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am on the way to without , late , and she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; m@@ om , you play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I don &apos;t want to tell me when two things are aware of :
&quot; &quot; &quot; first , I must say Yes to all and second , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she called me not &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they call no more &quot; estim@@ ation . &quot;
when is that happen ?
I miss it when I smo@@ ked Titan Poker and my Sum@@ men , and here everything changes in my own eyes .
and so she says : &quot; m@@ om , do you play ? &quot;
and I say : &quot; yes . &quot;
it is nothing special .
we play and play her sisters , we laugh@@ ing much and I read very dramatic from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding , because my pain and my pan@@ ic , in lon@@ el@@ iness and in lack of Sum@@ mer@@ ing , I can do nothing but to fit .
I am focusing on .
I am silent .
the land , which I create , the marathon , whom I run , the army , the screen , the high tone - they don &apos;t exist anymore .
everything that exists , st@@ icky fingers and mo@@ ist kiss@@ es , delicate voices , wax sti@@ p@@ ens and the song , in which it &apos;s going straight , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Ice Queen &quot; can get rid of .
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so short that I can hardly get breathing .
I can hardly believe that I at@@ me .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me solves .
a mental door goes on and an energi@@ zer come in .
and that &apos;s not immediately , but it happens .
I feel it .
the sum@@ s come back slowly .
no full noise , hardly because it &apos;s quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there .
not the sum@@ s , but a sum@@ s .
and now I feel when I know a magical mystery .
but let us remain with the thing .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something that we forgot .
the sum@@ s that labour to titanium , which is only the replacement .
if I ask you who are you , if I say you , if I am using my broad@@ casts and television hours and how working my brain is , then I forgot what the real sum@@ s is .
the sum@@ s is no power and it is not able to work .
it depends on the joy .
the real bu@@ zz is dependent on love .
the sum@@ s is the power , who comes from the life of life .
the real sum@@ s is self @-@ conscious and peace .
the real sum@@ s are igno@@ red the pressure of the story that ne@@ sting the tasks , anticip@@ ation and pressure .
the real sum@@ s is simple and original .
the real sum@@ s is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps he whis@@ per@@ ed to me the wrong words , for which God said to me that I am a titanium ?
it is just love .
we all need a little more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me I will say Yes .
I do not make the fixed rule , so that I can free myself as a workflow from any gu@@ ilt .
it is law , I have no other choice . I don &apos;t have any other choice if I want to hear the sum@@ s .
I wish it would be so simple . I &apos;m not good playing , I don &apos;t like it .
I don &apos;t play a wh@@ it@@ less so how to work .
does the truth hurt ,
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work because I love it .
I am better at the workplace as home .
this conf@@ ession is painful , because what a man does better work than to be house ?
well , yes , I .
hon@@ est@@ ly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I have to have problems .
that I am to be born , none of them .
we r@@ ni@@ es around the garden , and back , and back .
we make small dance Parties ,
we sing and play Ball .
we grin@@ d bubble bub@@ bles .
I feel the mainly sti@@ ff , ab@@ sent and conf@@ used .
I always burn after my phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
my children show me how to live , and the sum@@ s of the universe fulfil@@ s me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why did we ever hear with the games ?
you can also say ! say they always then Yes , if your child wants to play with you .
perhaps you hold me for n@@ ai@@ v , for a day dre@@ amer .
you probably have right , but you can do it !
you have time !
and know why ? you are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play at most 15 minutes with me , until they seem to do something else .
it is wonderful 15 minutes but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a Mari@@ enk@@ ä@@ fer or bis@@ cuit replace me .
and he speaks my teenage daughter , 15 minutes long with me , I am the mother of the year .
it is only 15 minutes , more need it not need .
each can bring 15 minutes on a piece , even on a bad mood !
15 minutes a piece !
no mobile phone , no clothes , no steering .
the day is short : dinner , the children beg@@ at .
but 15 minutes are in !
my children are my well@@ feeling , my world . there must not be the children . it applies to feel the sum@@ s to feel a place for his soul peace .
it is not going to play with your own children . it &apos;s for joy ,
to play the &quot; Play &quot; in general .
you can get yourself about 15 minutes !
find out what does good do you do .
find out and keep it out .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I &apos;ll fail and I live . friends meet , books read , the day enjoying --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stand for everything I got up when I got my first TV show , when I was a Titan in education , when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes a piece , why not for 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the sum@@ s returned in my free time . the sum@@ s seems back to return if I &apos;m not working .
work does not work without games .
it takes time , but after a few months , a door becomes coming in and I find myself in my office . I hear a unknown mel@@ ody , it ful@@ fills me and my soul . you will lead me to new ideas . I use it up again . I use it in full trains and love my work again .
I like the sum@@ s , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I am not the sum@@ s , the bu@@ zz is not I ... no more .
silk bub@@ bles and st@@ icky fingers , dinner with friends .
now that is my sum@@ s .
the sum@@ s of life .
the sum@@ s of love .
the sum@@ s of the work is part of me , but just a part . and I &apos;m so than@@ k@@ able .
it &apos;s me a bit that I &apos;m a titanium . I never seen a titanium , who plays his trip to Jerusalem .
I said Yes to less work and more games .
and nevertheless I have everything in the handle . my brain is still working . my bon@@ fire still burning .
the more I play , the more happy are me and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel like a good mother .
the more I play , the more clear is my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the sum@@ s . the land that I sw@@ ing@@ ing the marathon , which I run , the tro@@ users , the screens , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the others , the right sum@@ s : the sum@@ s of life .
the more I feel this sum@@ s , the more makes this unusual , getting , naked and new feeling in me wide . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel the same Sum@@ men , the more I know who I am .
I am author . I think of things I awake to life .
this belongs to the job , which means to live his dream .
this is the dream of this jobs ,
for a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
I said &quot; Yes &quot; to less work and more games .
titanium is not a chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you beautiful .
I am Neuro@@ sur@@ geon .
like most of my colleagues I have to do with human tragedy every day .
I know how to change your life from one second to the other , after a serious stroke or after a car accident .
for us , neuro@@ sur@@ geon is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to support for self @-@ healing .
after a severe injury of the central nerv@@ ous system , patients often have a lasting , severe disability .
this is probably the reason why I was functional Neuro@@ sur@@ geon .
what is a functional Neuro@@ sur@@ geon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerv@@ ous functions by different surgical measures .
certainly they have heard of one of the most well @-@ known , &quot; underground ir@@ stim@@ ulation . &quot; thereby we im@@ planted a electro@@ de deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons that improves neu@@ rolo@@ gic function .
it is really an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Park@@ inson , which suffered severe cit@@ ys and severe pain .
however , neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geon is the restoration of the brain .
we approach to this dream by my opinion .
I want to show you that we are very close to you .
with a little help , the brain can help yourself .
the history began 15 years ago .
at that time I was conduc@@ tive lie@@ utenant and worked day and night in the emergency .
I often supplied patients with skull @-@ Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ ma .
you must imagine that at skull @-@ Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ mat@@ a , you have to add the brain and the skull of the cran@@ ial .
to save life , you must decrease the cran@@ ial pressure .
it is sometimes necessary to remove a part of deer mass .
instead of the s@@ wollen mil@@ let mass , we decided to analyze ourselves with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a biolog@@ ist that analyze brain mass .
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is not easy task .
to leave cells from a tissue piece , is comparable with very small children who will be taken out of your families .
you need to find the proper diet , temperature , humidity and environments to th@@ ri@@ ve them .
just this we had to do with these cells .
after many trials , Jean François Hollande .
this he saw under his micro@@ scope .
that was a surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly as a stem cell culture . with large green cells that are surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
perhaps you know from the study group lessons that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells , which can transform itself into any cell type of organ@@ ism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , little niche of the brain .
it is surprising to get this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the OR .
we made another fascinating observation : normal cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die , they are imm@@ ort@@ al .
but these cells were different .
they divided slowly and after a few weeks , they even died .
so we saw a new , strange cell population that looked like stem cells , but it beha@@ ved differently .
we needed long to understand whence they came .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ b@@ ist@@ ort@@ in @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our cer@@ eb@@ ral cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the mo@@ ck@@ us , they provide the folding of the brain .
but why do they receive us ?
we do not know that .
we believe that they participate in the healing of brain since we find them in higher concentrations as close to brain injury .
but this is not so sure .
but one thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells .
we stand in front of a potential cellular source that permits brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ lingu@@ istic area and then take the cells exactly as cultiv@@ ate as Jean @-@ François did .
and they then highlight color to track them in the brain .
in the last step we im@@ planted them at the admission of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ ologist of transplan@@ tation -- aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we im@@ planted these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we im@@ planted the same cells in the same brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we were able to work with wise monkeys .
in the first scenario we im@@ planted the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that they were completely disappeared after some weeks when they were back home . the room is already occupied , they are not needed there , so van@@ ish them .
in the second scenario , we have a violation of and im@@ planted exactly the same cells , and now they t@@ opped the cells -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you can see what we could watch under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were im@@ planted .
the evidence showing them are these small points . these are the cells that we discovered in vitro , coloured in culture .
here we could not stop .
does this cells help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual movement task .
they had to take feed pellets of a tablet .
they made it very good .
when they had achieved a stable skill level , we last in the mot@@ ile cor@@ tex in the mot@@ mot@@ ic area .
the monkeys were par@@ aly@@ sed , they could no longer move their hand .
just as it would happen at people , they recovered spont@@ ane@@ ously up to a certain degree , just like after a stroke .
patients are par@@ aly@@ zed and then try to recover themselves with plastic brain mechanisms . they recover a certain degree , just like the monkeys .
when we were sure that the monkey had reached the degree of spont@@ aneous recovery , we im@@ planted its own cells .
on the left side they see the monkey , who recovered spont@@ ane@@ ously .
it can bring about 40 % to 50 % of its original power before injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
now you see when we im@@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the maturity .
I can tell you that were very exciting results for us .
since that time , we have found out much more about these cells .
we can use them to freeze and later .
we can use it in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example Park@@ inson &apos;s .
but our dream is still to im@@ plant them at people .
I really hope that I can show you soon as the human brain gives the means to heal yourself .
thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , this is wonderful , I &apos;m sure just now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know anyone who need it . &quot;
I definitely do .
of course , the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials in humans .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the greatest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results , one must fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this kind of studies .
BG : that &apos;s under@@ stand@@ able , the brain is very delicate etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and a professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried permission for the start of clinical trials . if you see further into the future , how many years it will take to a hospital , and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
it depends on the approval of the clinical study .
will we allow the authority to start it soon ?
then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients .
it already needs a long time to choose the patients to perform the treatments and assess whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
then you have to apply it to a multic@@ entr@@ e study .
you really need to prove that it is useful before you can offer these treatment .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting T@@ ED and that you have told us about it .
BG : thank you .
democracy .
in the West we make a big mistake to consider it as a naturally .
we see democracy not as the frag@@ ile plant that it is in reality but as inventory of our society .
we tend to consider it as an un@@ changeable mind .
we believe that capitalism leads to democracy .
that is not right .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and its big im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing have stag@@ gered that it is quite possible to have a blo@@ oming capitalism and impressive growth while politics is completely invisible .
in fact , democracy within us dis@@ appears in Europe .
at the beginning of the year when I presented Greece - the newly elected Greek government -- was un@@ am@@ big@@ uous that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- do not affect the savings programmes that were accomplished in Greece .
at this moment I thought that there could be no better justi@@ fication for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my friends who would repeat that democracy would be abolished if they would change anything .
at this point I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy .
I please , together with me again to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of a mistake , we could save our democracy , but that we need a tru@@ thful and def@@ ective democracy .
because without democracy our companies are mil@@ ked to our future , our future , and our grand , new technologies are w@@ asted .
in particular , I would like to remind you of interesting contra@@ diction , who currently threat@@ ens our inn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twin summit par@@ ad@@ ox &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the Schul@@ den@@ berg who has his long shadow over the United States , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the Schul@@ den@@ berg ,
but only few recognize his Di@@ d@@ ym@@ us .
a mountain of un@@ used cash , which is to aw@@ ful savings and corpor@@ ations , however , are to invest there where it would be productive and income also could bring to all the things that humanity needed to produce humanity , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past 3 months have been invested in the US , in England and in the Eurozone , 3.4 trillion U.S. dollars invested , in all the wealth of producing goods , such as industrial equipment , machinery , office buildings , schools , streets , tracks , equipment , and so on .
3,4 trillion U.S. dollars will sound like a lot of money until reaching the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing to gr@@ ate except the stock of stock and the real estate prices .
thus , debts and un@@ productive capital constitute the twin summit which is not compens@@ ated by the usual market mechanisms .
the result are stag@@ n@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ old in the USA , Japan and Europe are unemployed , which could not be investing in which they do not invest . exactly like Ö@@ di@@ pus Father , which could not be investing in which his son would kill him if he is growing ,
un@@ rolled the circumstances which leads to it that oil makes him k@@ ills .
that &apos;s my Ha@@ des with capitalism --
all un@@ productive capital should be used to improve human talents , improving our life , develop human talents , develop particularly all of the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are crucial for the rescue of the earth .
is democracy the solution ?
but before we proceed : what do we understand of democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the social form , in which the open and the poor as a majority of the government control .
of course , the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy had of course too many .
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
however , it would be an error , the job value of ath@@ en@@ ical democracy due to these in@@ clusions .
the decision to the ath@@ en@@ ical democracy was and is that they did not only agree the right to free expression of opinion , but important and decisive , which they have the right to policy @-@ determination with same mood bal@@ ancing in question of state aid .
the ath@@ en@@ ical democracy didn &apos;t have to be held quite long --
like a candle that lights very bright , it is also hat@@ ched quickly .
however , our current liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies did not have its roots in the ancient Athens ,
but in the Magna Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the ath@@ en@@ ical democracy focused on the free citizens , and the working poor strengthened , our liberal democracy on the values of Magna Cart@@ a , which ultimately became a statute for the prev@@ ailing democracy .
for the liberal democracy was only possible when a complete separation from politics and economy is possible and the democratic process was im@@ ited to politics , while the economy -- thus became the world of the corpor@@ ations -- a demo@@ cra@@ rati@@ onal zone .
in our present demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time of which this separation of politics and economy started , an un@@ her@@ ed@@ itary fight between the two , by the economy gradually increases politics and de@@ pu@@ ties them .
did you wonder why the politicians are not so much earlier ?
it is not on a de@@ generation of its DNA .
it is in fact that one can be in the government nowadays and nevertheless not in power because the power of politics in the economy is di@@ min@@ ed and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my shar@@ pen with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is about as a herd of rob@@ ber@@ ing , which is so sustainable the animals , of which they feed , dec@@ im@@ ated , that she is hungry at the end .
similarly , it is similar to the economy that grows by the self @-@ causing economic crisis itself , the power of the corpor@@ ations grows , the ine@@ quality increases , the mac@@ ro@@ economic demand is falling and the managing director of the corpor@@ ations are to be displac@@ ed to invest the cash of their companies .
the greater success of capitalism , the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; &#91; the people &#93; from democracy , the higher will be the twin summit , and the greater the waste of human labour and prosper@@ ity of humanity .
if that is true , it is obvious that we must bring down the policy and the economy , and it would be better when the Dem@@ os &quot; control , as in the Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
this is not a new idea .
the Marx@@ ist Lin@@ ke had this idea already 100 years ago and it wasn &apos;t really good .
the doctrine of the Deb@@ ak@@ el of the Soviet Union should be able to reg@@ ain the working poor only by a miracle as in Athens , without creating new species of breeding and waste .
but there is a solution : creating the processed arms !
capitalism does it , by replacing the low wages in automation and robots .
the problem is , as long as economy and politics are separate areas , automation makes the automation summit higher , the waste disposal , and social conflicts are deeper as it is already very soon as I believe -- in countries such as China will come .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we must implement the economy and politics again , and make sure that we are democratic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democratic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ compatible , otherwise we will show the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a documentary film &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so the question is not whether capitalism is the technical achievements that he has brought to survive .
the most interesting question is whether the capitalism is super@@ se@@ ded by a d@@ yst@@ opia , similar to that of the society in &quot; Star Trek , &quot; in which the machines serve human beings , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ en@@ ians &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long convers@@ ations to the sense of life .
I think we must be optim@@ istic .
so what would it like to look like this &quot; Star Trek &quot; -@@ like ut@@ opia instead of the &quot; Matrix &quot; like a similar D@@ yst@@ opia ?
in the practical implementation I would like to call you in all , some examples .
in the field of companies : ask a capital market before , in which one operates money , while you work and in your capital you will work from a working place to the next , and the company -- no matter in which one works -- is property of those who are currently working in the company .
then all in@@ comes from capital and proceeds and the concept of wage work is completely overhau@@ led .
no distinction between those who are among the companies do not work in it , and employees to work there , but the company does not belong . no tau@@ rine longer between capital and work , no major g@@ aps between investment and don@@ or , and ultimately no mass @-@ outstanding twin summit .
in the field of global political economy , please note that our national currencies would have a freely fluctu@@ ating rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which will be issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of 20 biggest Emer@@ ging Markets &#93; .
imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency , we call them &quot; the cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; Cos@@ mos , &quot; -- and every government paying the sum , corresponding to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the country , in a joint fund .
imagine that this fund invests in &quot; green &quot; technologies , particularly in parts of the world , in which investment funds are ra@@ r .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically the fact that John May@@ n@@ ard Ke@@ yn@@ es had proposed in the Bret@@ ton Woods Conference in 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it had not been the technical means of implementing it .
today we have it , especially in particular against the background of a re@@ unified policy and economy .
the world , whom I send you , is at the same time liber@@ ating , and mar@@ x@@ ist because they have buried the separation of capital and work in the tr@@ ash@@ can of history , and ke@@ yn@@ es@@ ian , globally ke@@ yn@@ es@@ ian .
but above all others it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy .
will we watch in such a world
or will we drop into a &quot; Matrix &quot; - similar to d@@ yst@@ opia ?
the answer depends on how we decide to decide on polit@@ ically .
it is in our hands , and we &apos;re doing it more democr@@ atically .
thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Y@@ an@@ is ...
you put yourself in your biography itself as liberal Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Y@@ an@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something of what I just said , then Marx is relevant .
the reason for re@@ unification of politics and economy ... do not do that , technological development will produce a massive decline in overall demand , Larry sum@@ mers as &quot; long @-@ term stag@@ nation &quot; .
due to the transfer of this crisis in a part of the Earth to the next , as we experience it currently , it will not only dest@@ abil@@ ize our Democrats , but also the countries , whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is true , then Marx is quite relevant ,
likewise as Hay@@ ek , that &apos;s why I am a liberal Marx@@ ist , and how Ke@@ yn@@ es , and therefore I am perfectly well @-@ effective .
BG : actually , and now we are too .
Y@@ V : if you are not effective , one think not enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosoph@@ ical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein , which told you to Singapore and China and yesterday at the supper of the Red@@ ner , you very clearly told what you will keep from the view of the West in China .
do you want to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a big measure of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies we have the certificate of democracy .
as I said in my speech , we have limited democracy for politics , while the area where most of it plays , -- the realm of economy -- a completely demo@@ c@@ lical zone .
in certain regard , if I may say that to pro@@ claim that , China is similar to the England of the 19th century .
for -- do not remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism to democracy -- that &apos;s a mistake , historically .
liber@@ alism , liber@@ als , as John Stuart Mill --
he was especially sc@@ ep@@ tical , regarding the democratic development .
what you can now see in China is quite similar to the development which we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
China now ought to do that which the West has committed itself in the 19th century , sm@@ ells massive to hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I &apos;m sure that many list@@ eners were curious to your experiences as Minister of Finance of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I knew that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back for six months later on the first six months ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , out of personal view@@ point , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing , because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
to adopt us from self @-@ counter@@ f@@ eit , and den@@ ying den@@ ying that a massive expansion line through the Eurozone fell , and continues to strike the development of all the European Union massi@@ vely .
we had the opportunity to reveal this den@@ ial -- on the basis of the Greek pre@@ stige -- the by the way --
sorry , the forces within the Eurozone , within the European Union , continues to den@@ ying den@@ ying .
but you know , what comes .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if one tries to get an economic system , which is not redund@@ able to get through political will and authority in life , it may be delayed for a while , but if then the change happens , he gets ab@@ rupt@@ ly and destroyed .
BG : which change do you see ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future if we do not change its construction .
BG : do you have any errors made in your time as Minister of Finance ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example , Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- seri@@ ousness ...
if there is a Minister for Finance , or any minister , who claims after 6 months in office , especially in a so called situation , claims that he did not make mist@@ akes , then that is a dangerous person .
of course I made mist@@ akes .
the greatest mistake was to sign the motion for the extension of the school programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an hon@@ our@@ able interest on pages of the banknotes to find a common solution .
but this did not exist .
they only wanted to fall our government , only because they wanted to deal with the g@@ aps who ran through the Eurozone .
they didn &apos;t want to prove that they have been through a cat@@ astroph@@ ic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
there is worse than during the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
no one out of the Tro@@ ika on the Banknote Co@@ ordin@@ ator who created us this policy : &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ ci@@ er mistake . &quot;
BG : in spite of all this , and despite the aggressive t@@ issues of talks , you still seem to be quite a @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone , opposite to som@@ eb@@ ody who lives and loves Europe .
my greatest fear is that the Eurozone did not survive .
for if they had not survived , the em@@ itted fli@@ ck@@ ers will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union .
this will not be cat@@ astroph@@ ic for Europe alone , but for the whole world economy alone .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we propose to the way of a post @-@ modern 1930 , then it will be post@@ pon@@ ed to me as well as to the future of Europeans even as the non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope that you are wrong in that point .
Y@@ an@@ is , many thanks you were at T@@ ED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
from Roy Price , most of Roy Price have never heard , although it probably is responsible for 22 medium minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very enter@@ taining minutes , but not for very many of them .
this goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is executive employee at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company from Amazon .
he is 47 years old , sl@@ ender , has a I@@ v@@ fr@@ is@@ ur and describes herself on Twitter as &quot; movies , TV , technology , Tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job , because he is responsible for this to produce the shows and content that will produce Amazon .
of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought industry .
there are so many TV series that Roy cannot choose any .
he must find shows that are very good .
in other words , he must find shows that are located on the turn right on this curve .
this curve is the evaluation of over 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the evaluation works from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows are preserved .
if your show is rated with nine and higher , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows as &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are ad@@ dic@@ tive , your brain asks , &quot; Where are there any more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
on the left , here at this end , shows shows how &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should be enough to tell what at this end of the curve .
Roy Price does not take care of the turn to the left side of the turn , because I think you have a special intelligence in order to offer &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
it makes more thoughts about the medium expres@@ sive , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they do not insp@@ ire .
so , he must make sure that it is really on the right side .
the pressure is available , and of course it is the first time that Amazon makes something like this , therefore Roy Price does not want to risk nothing .
he wants to create successes .
he needed a guaranteed success , so he holds a contest .
he takes up many ideas for TV shows and cho@@ oses an evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and displays them online where they can watch free of charge .
and if Amazon is found in vain things you get too , right ?
episodes of viewers look at this episodes .
however , they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows .
they are watched by Roy and his team that can record all .
you record when you start the show when you p@@ aus@@ ed what parts you ski@@ p or look at once again .
you collect millions of data to decide with these data , which show them should be producing .
in fact , they collect the data , process the answer and this is the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon ought to make a Sit@@ Com over four republi@@ can U.S. Sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
yes , &quot; alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many of this show could remember , because it was not so good .
it is only an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- since the average of this turn 7.4 and alpha House lan@@ det at 7.5 -- so something on average , but not just that which Roy and his team worked .
at the same time at another company , another manager found a top show through data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming of Net@@ fli@@ x . exactly like Roy is always on the search to find them a super @-@ show and he also uses data for it , but it makes it something different .
rather than to stage a competition , he and his team sent the existing data about Net@@ fli@@ x spectators , so the reviews they give the shows , whose shows what shows it like etc .
then you use these data to find out these little details about the spectators : what shows they like , which producer , what actors .
when they had together all the parts , they went a venture and decided to make a Sit@@ Com over four must@@ ators , but a drama series about an Senator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has made a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9,1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted .
of course , the question is : what happened here ?
one has two very competent , data experienced companies .
they connect these many data together and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this that is ?
because logic somehow states that this should work with all .
if you collect millions of data for a decision to meet you , then you should make a good decision .
one has 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
it optimi@@ zes it by very powerful computer .
the least what you can expect is good television , or ?
if data analysis is not working so it &apos;s something terri@@ fying because we are living in a time we would have more and more to statistics , to make serious decisions , far beyond television .
does anyone know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
no one . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody ever comes in contact with this software . come therefore in touch , you are in jail .
if anyone asks to go to the USA in prison and is prob@@ able , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a release is done or not .
just like at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but rather than decide whether a show is good or bad will be decided whether a person is good or bad .
moderate TV , 22 minutes , this can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results . that &apos;s not the way that a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
the data of the most experienced companies are always false .
yes , even Google makes mist@@ akes .
in 2009 , Google announced that they can predi@@ ct it by data analysis out@@ breaks , which may be worse , predic@@ ting -- due to data analysis of the Google research .
it worked wonder@@ fully and was a great news syn@@ dic@@ ation . success in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
it worked fl@@ aw@@ lessly , year around year , until it suddenly didn &apos;t work anymore ,
and no one could say why .
it simply did not work , this was once again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data of the most experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes understand something .
despite all these errors , data in the decisions of life one -- at the workplace , in the dispute , in medicine .
so we should make sure that data is helpful .
also I know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded Genet@@ ics -- a field where some very cle@@ ver people can ut@@ ili@@ ze many data to make serious decisions , such as decision for cancer
or the development of a medicine . over the years I recognized some patterns on the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this design should be spread .
you need to solve one more complex problem , do mainly do two things :
as the first , you can cut this problem into its components so you can analyze the individual parts ; as a second place , set the components together to create a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : to take apart and bring together .
and now the most important : data and data analysis are just good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help a problem and understand his parts .
you are not suitable to add the parts again and then come to a decision .
there is another tool and we all have it : our brain .
if there is something that is good at which the brain is good , it is parts and pieces again , even if the information is un@@ complete , even if the information is un@@ complete , especially if it is the brain of a experts .
therefore I think I was Net@@ fli@@ x so successful because they have used data and understanding , where they also belong to the process .
they use data to understand their audience better . but the decision to bring out all these parts , and make it a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; which doesn &apos;t matter the data .
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this show for this show , what meant that they entered a large personal risk with this decision .
Amazon , however , did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions , first as they voted for TV ideas , then selected as &quot; alpha House &quot; as a show .
it was a safe decision because they always could say : &quot; they tell us the data . &quot;
it does not lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better choices , but I think things goes wrong when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful are they , data are just a tool , and in order to forget that this tool is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before the data was made , this was the decision for decisions .
many know it .
it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it is amazing . for decisions by using a j@@ a- or no @-@ question you need to shake only the ball to get an answer . &quot; highly likely &quot; -- exactly here at this moment .
I will learn it later with a technique demo .
so far I met some decisions in my life , with that I should hear in the ball on the ball .
however , as you know of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace this through a lot of spin @-@ makers as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
so perhaps the ball cle@@ ver and cle@@ ver and cle@@ ver . ultimately , it is in us to make decisions when we want to reach something exceptional at the end of the right turn .
and I sensitivity to this as very encour@@ aging message that it still pays out to make decisions in spite of the great amount of data still paying decisions to make an expert in what you do , and risks associated .
because at the end there are not the data , but the risks with which you landing at the right side of the curve .
thank you beautiful .
