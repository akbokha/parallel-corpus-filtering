<seg id="1">That is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as the New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before someone heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book written in which he had spectacular the NSA illegphones by Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But there is another chapter that should leave a permanent impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a catastrophic U.S. intelligence operation, which the CIA was literally "literally" to a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If that sounds crazy, please read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It's an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who did not feel the chapter?</seg>
<seg id="9">The US government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years the government had been mined against rats and urged him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this train, he became a symbol of the pattern of government to condemn Whistleblower and journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the first constitutionality, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if media is not able to protect these information and cannot protect them identity of the muzzle.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government was anchor in Risen, he did something that had many brave reporter already before him, and he refused to go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk to go into prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the trial, something unusual.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, although for years, it would be indispensable for their case, the government's demands were dropped to Risen.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring, the reporter and sources can always hide less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of failing and to bring down to statements, this also could do its digital footsteps for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so, the investigators, without his understanding, worried about his telephone numbers,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like its e-mail data, financial and banking information, its lending service, and even travel information with the list of its flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of these information, they found evidence they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA-wound and crawed source.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, that is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama spoke in his presence of safeguards Whistleblower. but instead, the judiciary has been sentenced to more than all US governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how to be a problem, especially because the government is too much of her work as secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">As of September 11, almost every article on national security was the result of that a Whistleblower came to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">So we put the press work at the game which is protected by the first constitutionality because the government has always has more possibilities to express all out.</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as technology of the government allowed to manage the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources better.</seg>
<seg id="29">And though they are able to contact the moment, in which they can contact, instead of the neighbors, in the case of witness.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today, there is communication software that has not yet been written as a isen book, and it is much more safe than normal e-mails or telephone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such technology is SecureDrop, an open source report for Whistleblower, which was originally developed by the world's Internet, which was developed by us from the Freedom of the Press Foundation, which I have been working successfully.</seg>
<seg id="32">Rather than to send an e-mail, go to a news site, such as the Washington Post here.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you may instantly upload documents or send documents, like at each ordinary contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These will then be encrypted and stored on a server, which only has access to the relevant News Agency.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government cannot explain more information, and many of the information that would like to request would not be available.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole thing to protect the press freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments of all over the world have always been developing new spy technologies which are all endangered.</seg>
<seg id="38">It's to ensure that not only technology denominator such as Edward Snowden have a way to give iniquities. it is so important that we protect the next whistleblower,</seg>
<seg id="39">The lack of abuse during the supply of soldiers knows how to report and of overcrowded hospitals. or the next environmental workers, the alarm to be missed water by Flint. or a pilgrimage insider that warns us before the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">After all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to uncover crimes, but to protect our constitutionality.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on April 3, 2016 the biggest data base of the story was published.] [the "Panama Papers" reveal that the kingdom and Mighty] have been hid in tax bubbles.] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness, a declaration of 11 million records in Panama's legal law firm Mossack Fonseca</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents provides a small insight into the secret world of tax bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="44">We get an impression of what customers, banks and lawyers are going to go to companies such as Mossack Fonseca and say: "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you do that?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We really see the emails, the exchange of messages, as the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to its very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland Prime Minister is resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">Also there are reports that a federation of the brutal Syrian dictators Bashar al-Assad had oppressed companies in tax havases.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is alleged that a trace of 2 billions of US dollars to Russia's President Vladimir Putin will lead over a close friend of children's days, a famous Cellists.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be there a lot of rich people and others that wait any nervous to the next release, and to the next release documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now that sounds like the plot of a agencies or a John-Grisham-ROM.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems, cries away from you, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we take this?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax bubbles and not all their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And that affects us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">In all over the world, media and leading politicians, such as secret taxies are used to hide and swallow them -- something that we have been discussing and reveal their assets for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think of many people all the world will be very confusing, and it's difficult to understand how this tax havases work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I'll always stand there as a Matryoshkapuppe in front of me.</seg>
<seg id="60">So one company has a company in another company, in another company which makes it almost impossible to understand, really who behind these bones.</seg>
<seg id="61">It may be very difficult to understand the prosecution and tax authorities, as well as journalists or civil society really understand what thing is.</seg>
<seg id="62">I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports about this matter in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="63">Presumably, because there have been no prominent Americans that were present in these revelations, this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not so that there is no rich Americans that hide their assets in tax bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="65">But by the principle, after which this tax havases work, Mospack Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we have the Cayman Islands, or even from Delaware, Wyoming, or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">Indeed, it is so that you need to specify fewer information in some US-states to establish a company as to obtain a company library.</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of intransparent in the USA has allowed employees to zoomed to school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It is permitted to capture especially vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this sort of behavior, which affects us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness, we'll need to figure out how all this is in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">Thus we sent a covered investigations into the offices of 13 offices in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator gave himself an African minister, who wanted to bring suspects money into the USA to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked that everyone to an advocate of our investigator did, as he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">These were all preferences. no one of these lawyers received us as clients, and of course there was no man handed over to the money. however, it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It does not work for a single advocate who has submitted an investigator to our own investigator.</seg>
<seg id="79">It is not about a single peak politique, wrapped in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It is because the system works through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And in order to handle this, we must change the rules.</seg>
<seg id="82">We have to change the rules to make this type of behavior.</seg>
<seg id="83">That's all very blowing, as if we could do anything about it; as if it had nothing ever changed; as if it is always the rich and the mighty one will give it.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a borrowly optimal, I see that lot has started to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the last few years we have seen forward to more transparency, affecting the owners of companies.</seg>
<seg id="86">The topic found political attention by the British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then the EU has recorded into central registers at the national level, who really is behind companies in Europe, and who controls them.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is left behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have one of the bill into two parliamentary chambers, but this does not make progress that we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how this Panama revelies, this huge insight into the world of tax havases, is used to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness, this is a moment for changes.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind those companies.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need managers in the business that rise, saying," "" "Intransparent is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">We need the leading politicians that recognize the problem and finish in it by laws to terminate this type of intransparent.</seg>
<seg id="95">Together, we can finish the intransparent, which now allows this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money launderwear.</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story, as I was almost kidnapped and in the boot space of a red Mazdas would have landed.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I completed my designer, I made a backyard.</seg>
<seg id="98">A type in red Mazda stayed there and looked at my things.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my art works.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was in the city alone and made just a road journey through the whole country. afterwards he would go to the Peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me that he would change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">While we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him: "where do you sleep today?"</seg>
<seg id="104">"" "he made the whole thing even worse:" "" "I don't know." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought: Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just knew him now! he says he would go to the peace corps, but I don't know if he really is planning. I don't have abducted the boot space of a Mazdas!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small boot space!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard my saying," "" "I have air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "a voice in my head said," "" "Oh, how to pray?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">In the night I was in bed, I stared on the ceiling and thought: "Oh man! what have I broken up?</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild sleeping sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got a anxiety that I got out of the bed to shut up on tithes at the door, and closed my bedroom door.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The artwork, which he had purchased from me, is now on his classrooms. he is now teachers.</seg>
<seg id="120">That was my first experience as host. it has changed my eye-angle completely.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps people who have been sold out of childhood in childhood, actually friends who had been waiting to be discovered only on it?</seg>
<seg id="122">People can accomodate people on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's make a leap years, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I'm unemployed, almost pleite, my roommates, and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity is able to transform it in fun for fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote my best friend and new roommates Brian Chesky: "Brian, I have overlaid something like us. our apartment will come to a designer-bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk included, with a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a site and established the "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast. [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They loved it, and we also was.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese-ham Omelet tasted completely different because we made it for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them through the whole city. when we fell to our last guest and fell the door to the castle, Brian got the Brian and I joined us.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find out new friends at the same time?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came to the rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommates, nate Blecharczyk, joined us as developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We'll need to figure whether to make it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented to the investors: "we want to create a website, in the people publicly available images of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms that doors you pass when visiting.</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the Internet you can then invite you to stay wild people with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the missile might be ignited.</seg>
<seg id="142">But she did not.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one who is yet with consolation, would invest in a business that allowed strangers to sleep in flats of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because as children have learned all, strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If one has a problem, you indicate the things you can do well. we were designed to design.</seg>
<seg id="147">In the Academy of Fine Arts, we learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptics -- it is the total experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create trust between people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design be done so?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with its design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample sample, which degrees trust we increase.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will be out of your Comfortzone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up, if you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone in your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Enter your unlocking cell phone your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quiet anflug of panic, which you will feel -- -- is exactly what hosts will feel the first time to open the door.</seg>
<seg id="158">For the only thing that is still personal as your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your text, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the unlocked cell phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most will feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So, most guests will feel if they spend anywhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason, our company may exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">So, who actually has Al Gores's mobile now?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you say on Twitter so that he is responsible for the Office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of confidence we want to build. I would like to tell you some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we have changed a small detail in this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor would have presented itself once with his name; if he would have told how he does, like his dog or his children?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you have 150 convictions which say all, "he can really get very well locked out mobile phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you should leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-thought feedback system strengthens trust in confidence.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning, we did not make some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was difficult for people to abandon negative evidence.</seg>
<seg id="175">Ultimately, we decided to wait until both host and guest had submitted their findings before we put them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we have discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how probably it is that people trust one another, depending on how they are similar to age and residential area.</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprisingly we trust the people most, which are most similar.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less confidence we.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social Vocoder.</seg>
<seg id="181">Exciting, if one adds to the call of a person -- in our case through Beessments.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three divisions, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if one has more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation of common similarities from.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us to overcome some of our deep roots.</seg>
<seg id="186">Moreover, we drove that trust depends on how much man is available.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "if one tells us how" "" "Hi!" "" "you don't get no answer." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="189">One gets too much, such as: "I have problems with my mother" -- -- the request is not yet accepted.</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimal degree of openness, such as "Tolle works of art in your dwelling place! I have been doing with my family vacation."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can I create it with design to make this degree of offence?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text. we also give tips on which topics you should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our whole company builds on hope that the right design can help to overcome our approach to strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">With which we had not counted, the great multitude of people who were more than ready to have this incident.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you can see how many people take our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">One can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: incredible good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the untireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third: a need that had not been covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us the shop is very good.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course, there are also times if it's not running smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who celebrated unadmitted parties or apartments were devastated.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts will have guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked in customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the front front when trust was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it is already hurt when I think only.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment of listening to the voice of the callers, and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve us.</seg>
<seg id="208">Luckily, there had only a fraction of 123 million guestnights, only one fraction.</seg>
<seg id="209">For people trusted in one another.</seg>
<seg id="210">If trust works, the miraculous works can be created.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests took vacation in Uruguay. he suffered a heart attack there.</seg>
<seg id="212">His hosts drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He donated blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travellers who tend to heart attack due to their activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with adequate hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real fails to save a life although they don't know correctly.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive one in your own car to the hospital when you die, and wait, while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want to feel lonely, they bring books over.</seg>
<seg id="220">You can even stay longer without charge the extra-nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">Thus, of course not running any stay.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind pure money reaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">For the first time I went over this term, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the thought work together with money transactions?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is about a economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "but just simply" "" "to call the" "" "rental industry" "" "will not just be justified." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade show that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People create a part of itself, and this changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">When you travel nowadays, it is efficient and reliable, but it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">What if travelling a rich buffet from local inpress?</seg>
<seg id="232">What would be if you visited a group there, a group to wait there, to fill a thoroughly and one with a bar of a quarter, one of which one has never heard;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you can cook in a five star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Today, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to make apartments of reason to share?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What would be if cities would have to participate in the idea?</seg>
<seg id="238">I come to me cities that enable us society and relationships, instead of loneliness and amidling.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korean capital Seoul, this project started already. lots of parking places, which belonged to the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Residents offered in search of a lead, were offered in search of a lead,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were mediated to people whose children were pulled out. they were incubators were incubators,</seg>
<seg id="242">To start new startups in the Share economy. over our platform alone, 785 000 people in 191 countries are being invited to a stranger, or even hosts.</seg>
<seg id="243">The idea seems to be so crazy about how it was brought to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">We also gave it before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work?</seg>
<seg id="248">In addition to happiness and timing, we realized that you can find out the right design with the components of confidentiality.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us to overcome deepest guardians.</seg>
<seg id="250">I think it's amazing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Deserved great.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it once, when a red Mazda starts on me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know of course that design can't solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us if it had this great impact, I wonder what design would be coming soon.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think when you watch me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believers? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, a deception, undergo a terror ist?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay at the airport on the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you the fault for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media represent such as I look like.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of the coverage of Islam and Muslims are negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: American my, most would not know any Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Presumably the people are not speaking with their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For all those who have never experienced a Muslims: it is great, you know.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I'm a mother, a coffee maker -- twice espresso, with whipped cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am verted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A Mövending-Fitness-Fanatikerin,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I'm a practicing, spiritual Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not as Lady Gaga sings, for, baby, I was not born.</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided it.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17, I met the decision to ousted me.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as a homosexual man, like some of my friends, but as Muslims. I decided to wear Hijab, my head.</seg>
<seg id="277">My feminist friends were horrified: "why did you suppress yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">The Lustige was: that time it was a feminist declaration of independence, namely, opposite the pressure that I felt as a 17-year-old, I felt a perfect and unachievable beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only received the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have delays with the grain.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought, thought in question, doubted and believed.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">She was trust and slow commitment to cover themselves with each reading of the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="284">Sometimes the beauty of the rhythm brings me to the weeping.</seg>
<seg id="285">I know myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Did you ever feel the feeling that someone doesn't perceive you completely, and loves somehow?</seg>
<seg id="287">It feels like that.</seg>
<seg id="288">Later I married and began, like all the good Egyptians, my career as an engineering.</seg>
<seg id="289">I later had a child after my marriage, a child, and lived in the "Egyptian-American dream."</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came the terrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember, where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"" "I sat in my kitchen, had ended up at the end, looking onto the screen and saw the" Eil" "message" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke, aircrafts in buildings, people spun out of buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was this?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disorder?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock turned into indignation quickly.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should I do so?</seg>
<seg id="299">"" "I changed the television channel and heard:" ""... "Muslim terrorists..." ""... "..." ""... "" ""... "" ""... "Jihad..." ""... "" ""</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh, my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">It is not just my country, but in the Nu related me the deeds of others from a civil society in suspects.</seg>
<seg id="302">On the same day we had to go through the Middle West of the USA to move into a new city and to start with the postgraduate course.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember, as I was silent -- as we were silent -- as deep it went into my seat, and I was afraid that I was afraid of the Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved to our apartment in this night, in a new town, in which it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">And then, I saw, and read the warnings of the National islamic organisations which said, "Be careful," Be careful, "lead in well illuminated areas," says you not. "</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week inside.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday that week -- the day when Muslims gathered to gather Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="308">"" "and again, the warnings:" "" "does not work on this first Friday, the mosque might be a goal." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw me the extensive reporting.</seg>
<seg id="310">The feelings of feelings were infiltrated and I heard of attacks on Muslims or by people who stayed for Muslims in free and struck down.</seg>
<seg id="311">There was really branching on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something felt not feeling right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because people who attacked this country have attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I turned the rage of people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to explain himself.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing about questions, I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">There are accusations which are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Today, we can really hear people: "there is a problem in this country -- it means Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we go on? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to join Muslims and mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church as of a tumours in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">It is only the question: are we malignant or amorous?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know: a malicious tumor is removed as a whole and malicious tumor can only be kept under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims are like all other Americans, no tumor on the body of the United States, but an essential organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are Inventors and Teacher, Ersthelium and Olympiad.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of Mosques America safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">There may be quite a few parking spaces, but not stop the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit of a mosque manages to consider people to tolerant people more tolerant and greater part of citizens.</seg>
<seg id="333">And like me a leader of the police in the Washington coast of Washington, he recently told: people are actually not radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radialized in their cellars or in bed before a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">During the radio process it is found that it begins online. as the first, the person's person is cut off, even from their family, that the person believes that the person believes that the person believes that the person who believes the true Muslims, and everyone who abhates their behaviour and ideology, is abdicated or fallen by faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalization, we must stop the people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some of them still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS develops their brood-ality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As Muslims, as a mother, as a man, I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would like to add to their predecessors, if you recognize them as a representative of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam, as the Ku-Klux clan interview with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology reasons for their "Holy book."</seg>
<seg id="344">But when you cast a look at her, she doesn't drive them in her "Holy Scripture."</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brood-ality that they can read these things into the Scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding imam told me an astonishing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she gave to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him whether they had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said that the problem was exactly the opposite. every spirit, having spoken it, brought them to silence, and told her that their wrath, their sense to unrighteousness in the world, would only bring them into difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="350">Nothing inspired and something that had been given to their rage, she was a main goal for instrumentalisation by extremists who spoke a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This imam presented the connection to God and their congregation.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accuse for their rage, he showed her constructive way for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What they met in the mosque, they kept it before to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">It was an insight, like the Islamophobia myself and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it work on normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it work on each other?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear fear every day on our democracy, on our freedom of freedom?</seg>
<seg id="358">A study -- actually several neuroscientious studies -- show: if we fear, we will pass at least three things.</seg>
<seg id="359">We rather accept a authoritarian government system, conformity and advantages.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study shows: if one reported test individuals, in which negative about Muslims was reported, they were rather military attacks on Muslim countries and the circumcision of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you see when the mood swapped against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then it happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the apron of the Iraq war and during two electoral periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So, Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction on Moslem-terror, as I expected it.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool to manipulation to be public to undertake the foundation of a free society that has sensible and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it as the first, but the toxic air of fear fell upon us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the assignment of collective debt, it is not only about to explain himself.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple, which lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was an athlete.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was at the dental faculty, talented, and promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would say to me that he was the most common, generous man, whom they knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there, and he showed her life-run. she was blossess and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"when is such a young man from my breasts?"</seg>
<seg id="375">Just a few weeks after visiting Suzanne with her brother and his wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, she was murdered, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan who had posted in the afternoon. he did it in her apartment, after taking a postion against Muslims on his Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="376">He shot eight times to Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanatism can not only be morally, but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Are we gone to the mosque or we stayed home safely?</seg>
<seg id="381">We felt it and for us it was not a light decision, because it was because we would like to check our children in America: one that would control us through fear, or one where we can freely exercise our religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided to give us for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the children's seat, we loved it with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, my shoes went out, went into the building hall, and what I saw it left me.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made a announcement, thanked, and welcomed our guests, because the half of the gathered Christians were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers, and non-believers who came, not to attack us, but to stand for us.</seg>
<seg id="387">At this moment I have collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had courage and compassion.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose from the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Are you going to go to number?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or are you join to which my: we are better than those.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you beautiful!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have met a nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder what do you say that you might say that you have a TEDTalk, a monument with deep-pass, thus an exception and not the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say about those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say, do not lie down. I'm totally normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am no exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I usually have such as it is permitted.</seg>
<seg id="402">When you look at Muslims all over the world, and I did that with the largest ever carried out on Muslims in all over the world, people want to normal people.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want prosperity to the family, they want to work and want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I'm not an exception in any respect.</seg>
<seg id="405">If people appear as a rule, then the rule is broken, and they are not the exception to rule.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: thank you. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">What began as a platform for hobbyists, it stands just before, a billion business.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. it is made possible in research institutions around the world.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air package into our social awareness, a autonomous fleet of aircraft at the Frac Centre in France has built up a six metres high tower from 1 500 bricks. some years ago they began to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">Through connecting cables achieve high speed and acceleration in the smallest space.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-loaded structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">You have learnt to bear loads with turbulences and to react to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of Possible flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order to work a system autom, it must know collectively, where the mobile objects are located.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic suspension.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos, we use a new localization technology of Verity Studios, a publisher of our laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in space, calculations on board which should do the machine.</seg>
<seg id="420">External commands are available at the highest degree e. g. "and" landen ".</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called rear starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A plane that tries to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starters, it is efficient in the forward flight, much more efficient than helicopters in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most starters, it can be boar, and thus has great advantages at the start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">But there is always a small side.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of hedging is that they react sensitively to turbulences like wind turbines.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new control and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the device does not matter the optimal position, and the achievement can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often introduce fundamental rights issues to enter the nucleus of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be for example: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for this to know the answer to a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known about machines with a thousand moving parts that are gathering together to violate you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Recently, trained pilots could fly remote control units, which had only two moving parts: a propellers and a hedge of the rear.</seg>
<seg id="435">We discovered that flying with just one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the Monospinner that served mechanically simplest flying device. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has just a movable part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No valves, hinges and lateral ruster, no further gear unit or control surfaces, just a propellers.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it's mechanically simple, the interior happens very much so it can fly stable and can move in the space.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the tailgate. to get there to fly, I must take it exactly right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The probability of throwing it exactly once all, is low, so I'll show you a video that was filmed in the night last night.</seg>
<seg id="442">When the Monospinner is a practice in pleasures, this machine is the machine here with its eight propellers, a practice in overflow.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this overflow?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that he is just symmetrically.</seg>
<seg id="445">Therefore, he is equivalent to ambivalent in its orientation.</seg>
<seg id="446">As a result he receives the auditory capability;</seg>
<seg id="447">To move in the space in all directions, no matter how it is turned or even like he rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course it is complex, mainly in the field of interactive rivers of eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">A lot is adjustable in models, the rest is learned directly at the fly.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's see that.</seg>
<seg id="451">When flying machines should be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine consists of two separate two-propeller-aircraft engines.</seg>
<seg id="453">This rotates clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other toward the clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">If you meet them, they are like a high-performance Quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">However, if somewhat shief -- a engine or propeller falls off, the electronics or one battery -- can continue to fly the machine if also limited.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will be demonstrating that we are able to make a half airworthy.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration examined synthetic swarming.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took standard micro-Quadcopter -- every single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and outfit them with localising technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where space is and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully please make these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine would like to exercise a flying lamp screen at Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us is the reward in the development and of the activity.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a memory, as wonderful and honourable our universe is, and that it is creative, warfs it to form a spectacular fashion.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has massive industrial and economic potential is the dot on the i.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="469">1.3 billion years ago in a very far away galaxy, two black holes were increasingly quicker, they turned the mass three to be in a tenths of a tenths of pure energy.</seg>
<seg id="470">This short moment they lightened them brighter than all stars in all galaxies of the entire universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a great Knall.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they didn't put their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy became in the space-time limit itself and the universe exploded in gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">We arrange the events at first time.</seg>
<seg id="476">A majority of 1.3 billion years ago was a majority of life on earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then, Earth has been quite different: corals, fish, plants, saurier, people and -- God arise for -- even the internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group of especially courageous -- Rai Weiss, of MIT, KIP Thorne and Ronald Drever of the Caltech -- to build a huge laser detector to search for gravitational waves, caused by plating black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most held them for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized them as a mad genius, so that the US National Science Foundation financed her idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, design, concept and extremely much hard work, they supervised the detector LIGO: the laser-interferometrival Observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the follow-up time, precision of LIGO was increased significantly, which improved the detection performance enormously.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is called Advanced LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015 LIGO was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor, persistent problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On 14 September 2015, only a few days after the commissioning of the detector, the gravitational waves of the two colliating black holes were through the earth through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were emotional than that:</seg>
<seg id="489">The Birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell was my father's father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically, that was the fruit of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All this, what I worked, is not more science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretically physicist at MIT. he has examined over 23 years of gravitational waves like LIGO signals. but what are gravitational waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is an ruction in the weight of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When passing through the shaft, the room and its whole content are stretched into a direction, and the other side are overthrown.</seg>
<seg id="495">To illustrate dozers in courses on the theory of relativity often you often have a true dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dusty, stretching and dusty."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational waves extremely weak, even ridiculous, are ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14, for example, each of us was stretched out by us when the waves beat and striped. the elongation of an average human being was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">This means 20 zeros after the Komma, followed by a 1. so I declared the LIGO staff for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five kilometer long laser detector, which is already absurd, this length would have to be measured on less than a thousandths of the radius of an atomic nudes. that's grotesk.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text on gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">Described KIP Thorne, a co-founder LIGOs, the hunt for the waves in the following way: "the technical difficulties when building such detectors are massive.</seg>
<seg id="503">But physicist shall be final and with the support of the public, all obstacles are overcome. "</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne has published this in 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to LIGO. Scott claims that LIGO would be more than one eye than one eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than the things around us: factions, the size of your mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical. for example, you can make a picture or a map of things by taking the light from several points to perceive around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">The sounds are different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible tones have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">Therefore, it is very difficult to produce a picture of things that mean you particularly much:</seg>
<seg id="512">About the face of your child.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead, we listen to certain properties like clay and height, rhythm and volume to close to history.</seg>
<seg id="514">"now it speaks Alice."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"number Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We can't make any simple pictures of objects in all.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by looking forward changes to the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least, the measured frequencies are at the audible range for LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="521">So when we convert wave pattern into sound, we can literally hear the universe.</seg>
<seg id="522">The gravitation can listen to us about the collision of two black holes when my colleague Scott has already been busy.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotating holes, hubs simple: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Turn the two body very quickly, you hear the same circulation with an additional tone change. sounds like: Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of motion which shaped into the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I never forget -- heard LIGO: [Surrender of the sound] no one knows what he needs to hear, this as the sound of -- SH:... two black holes with each 30-fold solar mass, which are roughly as fast as the bars of your mixer.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: superior to us what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the densest body in all, one with a mass of 29 shuns, the other with a mass of 36 tons, revolve each one hundred times a second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine that forces before.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know it because we heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">There is the lasting meaning of LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="533">LIGO ebnet a completely new way to explore the universe as it was never before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to the all and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in all, we can not see -- practically or basically --.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why massacres the stars in super novas.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. of them we have learnt much about the all.</seg>
<seg id="538">The exciting physical actions occurred but in the core, which is behind thousands kilometres of iron, carbon and silicon hidden.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see where these opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational waves penetrating iron, as it would be transparent glass. the urine: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it because the hatch is covered by his own offspring.</seg>
<seg id="541">The help of gravitational waves should be possible to look at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen that we never seen, and of which we don't have any idea. things we can only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, LIGO found the first attraction in fact that we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague on the MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO project, says to this topic: me: the kind of stars, the black holes were observed, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies from prehistoric times. the black holes are so to speak the suction cup for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">LIGO enables us to give us a completely different viewing angle on the events in the All, on the emergence of the stars and ultimately how we went out of this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is now to be as good as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to LIGO we know how to build a great detectors and listen to the noise and pen of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a brand new generation of homservatories at the earth and in all.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could I be beautiful than to listen to the urine?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time I tried an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">One year I would say to all "Yes!" I was afraid of whom I feared.</seg>
<seg id="556">No matter whether it made me nervous to say me in unpleasant situations, I forced me "Yes" to say.</seg>
<seg id="557">Will I speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Would I want to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Would I want to start with the scene?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a mad thing happened: exactly that to do, wovor I feared me, removed my fears.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fears, talk to speeches, my social fear -- Puff, gone.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes" my life changed.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a particular Yes that changed my life to an unexpectedly. it all started with a question of my sheep.</seg>
<seg id="569">"" "I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett, and Emerson." ""</seg>

<seg id="571">"" "" "" "Evaluate, I need milk for my barumbillasse" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="572">She asked me if I could play with her when I was just on the go. and I said: "yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new life setting in my family. from there I swears to play always with them, as soon as you're doing it, or whatever I go, I say always Yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect but I am tired of it.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, on my children, on our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has a blossom-effect: just before short, I actually proved that the "" "" Yes "" "" for playing with my children rescued my career. "" "</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am author. I think of things, raised to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No. no.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create TV. I create TV.</seg>
<seg id="585">I do TV, in large style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season, I'm responsible for you to spend 70 hours of programme into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four television programs, 70 hours television. three to four shows are produced at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each consignment provides hundreds of jobs that previously didn't exist.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a television set can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode of four days, four television programs, four television programs, 70 hours TV, three broadcasts that are simultaneously in production, once four, 16 episodes: Scandal, 15 episodes: Scandal, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Bottom, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours television,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America, my television series are running on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world, my series are running in 256 languages in 67 different languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are broadcasts that I create myself, and not only produced so I have to find time, really cool, creative time to gather my fans the campfires and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four television series, 70 hours television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires, who burn around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who makes it still?</seg>
<seg id="598">No one, therefore I'm a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you.</seg>
<seg id="601">"" "I say it, because I know what you think when the word" author "falls." ""</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you all of them that work so hard as you can take a company, a country or a classroom to take me if I say of work, that I don't just tell me when I say: I understand that there is no dream about it in a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It's all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I'm working much, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I am deepened to work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work creates always a country out of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is, when I set up troops, when I painted on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">As dreaming of a high tone, it's a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">One feels like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that were at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work it.</seg>
<seg id="612">She is creative, mechanically, strenuous and intoxicuous, clinically and mishly, cruel, and reasonable. and the best of it is the sums.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when working.</seg>
<seg id="614">A buzz begins in my head, and it grows and growing, and the sums sounds like a busy street, I could always go to it for ever.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people assume, if I tell them the sums, I notice the writing that the writing is ready for me.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong, that does it.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the sums -- when I began working with the TV production when I started working and work together to create and work together, I discovered this thing, this sums, this energy. the sums!</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums is more than the writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums is action and activity. the sums is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sums is music. the sums is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The sums is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have a sum, then you can't go differently than to size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling doesn't feel different, than for size, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or perhaps it also means a workpiece.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it means genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is Ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of a failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I only know that I am not for the failure, and I only know that I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="631">I will only tell you, I'm a Titan, and I know that I don't want it into question.</seg>
<seg id="632">To achieve a clear: ever, ever more broadcasts, the more details, the more work, the more work is, the more work at the same time, the more about me, the more so I write history so more expectations exist.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more must work me.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The land, which I create, the marathon, whom I run, the army, the screen, the high tone, the sums, the sums, the sums.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sums. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the sums.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only this sum?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revised, agitated, exaggerated, aggerated.</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stops.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mom is an only worker institute.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mom will not be there, but you can write my nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">And Emerson says: "Evaluate, I want to go to Shonda country."</seg>
<seg id="646">There are the children of a titanium.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are Baby-Titanen.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the sums heard.</seg>
<seg id="649">The sums of the engine stopped.</seg>
<seg id="650">I loved my work no more. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums did not return.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sums was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I made the same things as always: the same titanium work, 15 hours-day, continuous weekends, no regret, nothing to delegate, a titanium sleep not, with all your heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sums.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four television programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four television programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a show Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was gray, I just had no fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">All that I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sums and the sums I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do if you do, work, which one loves, suddenly fouled?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "I know, some may think:" "" "Heule you from, blöder author Titan" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know what you do, you can do to be one teacher, a banker to be a teacher, a painter, Bill gates, and knows how to feel the sums when you knew the sums, if the sums stops, who is it then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you like?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">When song of my heart hears, I can survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "South States waitress" depicts a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I am on the way to without, late, and she says:" "" "mom, you play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I don't want to tell me when two things are aware of:</seg>
<seg id="674">"" "first, I must say Yes to all and second," "" "she called me not" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="675">They call no more "estimation."</seg>
<seg id="676">When is that happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">I miss it when I smoked Titan Poker and my Summen, and here everything changes in my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">And so she says: "mom, do you play?"</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say: "yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">It is nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play and play her sisters, we laughing much and I read very dramatic from the book "Everybody Poops."</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding, because my pain and my panic, in loneliness and in lack of Summering, I can do nothing but to fit.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focusing on.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am silent.</seg>
<seg id="686">The land, which I create, the marathon, whom I run, the army, the screen, the high tone - they don't exist anymore.</seg>
<seg id="687">Everything that exists, sticky fingers and moist kisses, delicate voices, wax stipens and the song, in which it's going straight, or whatever the girl in "The Ice Queen" can get rid of.</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so short that I can hardly get breathing.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I atme.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me solves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes on and an energizer come in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that's not immediately, but it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums come back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full noise, hardly because it's quiet, hardly audible, but it is there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the sums, but a sums.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel when I know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let us remain with the thing.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something that we forgot.</seg>
<seg id="705">The sums that labour to titanium, which is only the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who are you, if I say you, if I am using my broadcasts and television hours and how working my brain is, then I forgot what the real sums is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The sums is no power and it is not able to work.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real buzz is dependent on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The sums is the power, who comes from the life of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real sums is self-conscious and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real sums are ignored the pressure of the story that nesting the tasks, anticipation and pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sums is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real sums is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps he whispered to me the wrong words, for which God said to me that I am a titanium?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a little more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me I will say Yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I do not make the fixed rule, so that I can free myself as a workflow from any guilt.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no other choice. I don't have any other choice if I want to hear the sums.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so simple. I'm not good playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">I don't play a whitless so how to work.</seg>
<seg id="722">Does the truth hurt,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I am better at the workplace as home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This confession is painful, because what a man does better work than to be house?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, yes, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">Honestly, I call myself "Titan" --</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am to be born, none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">We rnies around the garden, and back, and back.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance Parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play Ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We grind bubble bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">I feel the mainly stiff, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always burn after my phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the sums of the universe fulfils me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why did we ever hear with the games?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also say! say they always then Yes, if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Perhaps you hold me for naiv, for a day dreamer.</seg>
<seg id="742">You probably have right, but you can do it!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And know why? you are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play at most 15 minutes with me, until they seem to do something else.</seg>
<seg id="748">It is wonderful 15 minutes but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a Marienkäfer or biscuit replace me.</seg>
<seg id="750">And he speaks my teenage daughter, 15 minutes long with me, I am the mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">It is only 15 minutes, more need it not need.</seg>
<seg id="752">Each can bring 15 minutes on a piece, even on a bad mood!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes a piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile phone, no clothes, no steering.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children begat.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are in!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my wellfeeling, my world. there must not be the children. it applies to feel the sums to feel a place for his soul peace.</seg>
<seg id="758">It is not going to play with your own children. it's for joy,</seg>
<seg id="759">To play the "Play" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">You can get yourself about 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what does good do you do.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and keep it out.</seg>
<seg id="763">I'm not perfect in it. I'll fail and I live. friends meet, books read, the day enjoying --</seg>
<seg id="764">"" "" "" "do you want to play?" "" "stand for everything I got up when I got my first TV show, when I was a Titan in education, when I wanted to surpass myself more and more." ""</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes a piece, why not for 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums returned in my free time. the sums seems back to return if I'm not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Work does not work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months, a door becomes coming in and I find myself in my office. I hear a unknown melody, it fulfills me and my soul. you will lead me to new ideas. I use it up again. I use it in full trains and love my work again.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the sums, but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the sums, the buzz is not I... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Silk bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">Now that is my sums.</seg>
<seg id="775">The sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sums of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The sums of the work is part of me, but just a part. and I'm so thankable.</seg>
<seg id="778">It's me a bit that I'm a titanium. I never seen a titanium, who plays his trip to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said Yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And nevertheless I have everything in the handle. my brain is still working. my bonfire still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the more happy are me and my children.</seg>
<seg id="782">The more I play, the more I feel like a good mother.</seg>
<seg id="783">The more I play, the more clear is my head.</seg>
<seg id="784">The more I play, the better I work.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I play, the more I hear the sums. the land that I swinging the marathon, which I run, the trousers, the screens, the sums, the sums, the others, the right sums: the sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I feel this sums, the more makes this unusual, getting, naked and new feeling in me wide. less Titan -- more I!</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I feel the same Summen, the more I know who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I am author. I think of things I awake to life.</seg>
<seg id="789">This belongs to the job, which means to live his dream.</seg>
<seg id="790">This is the dream of this jobs,</seg>
<seg id="791">For a dream job should be a little dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">I said "Yes" to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="793">Titanium is not a chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am Neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues I have to do with human tragedy every day.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how to change your life from one second to the other, after a serious stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us, neurosurgeon is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to support for self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a severe injury of the central nervous system, patients often have a lasting, severe disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I was functional Neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional Neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nervous functions by different surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">Certainly they have heard of one of the most well-known, "underground irstimulation." thereby we implanted a electrode deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neurons that improves neurologic function.</seg>
<seg id="805">It is really an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson, which suffered severe citys and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">However, neuromodulation does not mean Neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeon is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">We approach to this dream by my opinion.</seg>
<seg id="809">I want to show you that we are very close to you.</seg>
<seg id="810">With a little help, the brain can help yourself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The history began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At that time I was conductive lieutenant and worked day and night in the emergency.</seg>
<seg id="813">I often supplied patients with skull-Hirn-trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">You must imagine that at skull-Hirn-traumata, you have to add the brain and the skull of the cranial.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save life, you must decrease the cranial pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">It is sometimes necessary to remove a part of deer mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of the swollen millet mass, we decided to analyze ourselves with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist that analyze brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">To leave cells from a tissue piece, is comparable with very small children who will be taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You need to find the proper diet, temperature, humidity and environments to thrive them.</seg>
<seg id="823">Just this we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many trials, Jean François Hollande.</seg>
<seg id="825">This he saw under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly as a stem cell culture. with large green cells that are surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you know from the study group lessons that stem cells are unripe cells, which can transform itself into any cell type of organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, little niche of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to get this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the OR.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells were different.</seg>
<seg id="835">They divided slowly and after a few weeks, they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange cell population that looked like stem cells, but it behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand whence they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doubistortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our cerebral cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of the mockus, they provide the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they receive us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they participate in the healing of brain since we find them in higher concentrations as close to brain injury.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so sure.</seg>
<seg id="848">But one thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We stand in front of a potential cellular source that permits brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area and then take the cells exactly as cultivate as Jean-François did.</seg>
<seg id="853">And they then highlight color to track them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step we implanted them at the admission of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologist of transplantation -- autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we implanted these cells into normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we implanted the same cells in the same brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we were able to work with wise monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario we implanted the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that they were completely disappeared after some weeks when they were back home. the room is already occupied, they are not needed there, so vanish them.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario, we have a violation of and implanted exactly the same cells, and now they topped the cells -- they grew up to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you can see what we could watch under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were implanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence showing them are these small points. these are the cells that we discovered in vitro, coloured in culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Here we could not stop.</seg>
<seg id="864">Does this cells help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual movement task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take feed pellets of a tablet.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made it very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they had achieved a stable skill level, we last in the motile cortex in the motmotic area.</seg>
<seg id="869">The monkeys were paralysed, they could no longer move their hand.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen at people, they recovered spontaneously up to a certain degree, just like after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">Patients are paralyzed and then try to recover themselves with plastic brain mechanisms. they recover a certain degree, just like the monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were sure that the monkey had reached the degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted its own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left side they see the monkey, who recovered spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can bring about 40% to 50% of its original power before injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now you see when we implanted the cells: the same monkey, two months after the maturity.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time, we have found out much more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can use them to freeze and later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use it in other neuropathological models, for example Parkinson's.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implant them at people.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can show you soon as the human brain gives the means to heal yourself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, this is wonderful, I'm sure just now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think: "I know anyone who need it."</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely do.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials in humans.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the greatest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results, one must fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this kind of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: that's understandable, the brain is very delicate etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and a professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried permission for the start of clinical trials. if you see further into the future, how many years it will take to a hospital, and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">It depends on the approval of the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will we allow the authority to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It already needs a long time to choose the patients to perform the treatments and assess whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">Then you have to apply it to a multicentre study.</seg>
<seg id="897">You really need to prove that it is useful before you can offer these treatment.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you have told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">In the West we make a big mistake to consider it as a naturally.</seg>
<seg id="903">We see democracy not as the fragile plant that it is in reality but as inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider it as an unchangeable mind.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not right.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and its big imitators in Beijing have staggered that it is quite possible to have a blooming capitalism and impressive growth while politics is completely invisible.</seg>
<seg id="908">In fact, democracy within us disappears in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year when I presented Greece - the newly elected Greek government -- was unambiguous that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- do not affect the savings programmes that were accomplished in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At this moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my friends who would repeat that democracy would be abolished if they would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I please, together with me again to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup of a mistake, we could save our democracy, but that we need a truthful and defective democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">Because without democracy our companies are milked to our future, our future, and our grand, new technologies are wasted.</seg>
<seg id="914">In particular, I would like to remind you of interesting contradiction, who currently threatens our inn.</seg>
<seg id="915">"" "I call it the" "" "twin summit paradox" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known to you. you know and recognize him as the Schuldenberg who has his long shadow over the United States, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the Schuldenberg,</seg>
<seg id="918">But only few recognize his Didymus.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which is to awful savings and corporations, however, are to invest there where it would be productive and income also could bring to all the things that humanity needed to produce humanity, for example "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past 3 months have been invested in the US, in England and in the Eurozone, 3.4 trillion U.S. dollars invested, in all the wealth of producing goods, such as industrial equipment, machinery, office buildings, schools, streets, tracks, equipment, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">3,4 trillion U.S. dollars will sound like a lot of money until reaching the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing to grate except the stock of stock and the real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus, debts and unproductive capital constitute the twin summit which is not compensated by the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result are stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-old in the USA, Japan and Europe are unemployed, which could not be investing in which they do not invest. exactly like Ödipus Father, which could not be investing in which his son would kill him if he is growing,</seg>
<seg id="925">Unrolled the circumstances which leads to it that oil makes him kills.</seg>
<seg id="926">That's my Hades with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">All unproductive capital should be used to improve human talents, improving our life, develop human talents, develop particularly all of the technologies, "green" technologies that are crucial for the rescue of the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we proceed: what do we understand of democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the social form, in which the open and the poor as a majority of the government control.</seg>
<seg id="931">Of course, the Athenian democracy had of course too many.</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be an error, the job value of athenical democracy due to these inclusions.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decision to the athenical democracy was and is that they did not only agree the right to free expression of opinion, but important and decisive, which they have the right to policy-determination with same mood balancing in question of state aid.</seg>
<seg id="935">The athenical democracy didn't have to be held quite long --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle that lights very bright, it is also hatched quickly.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our current liberal democracies did not have its roots in the ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the athenical democracy focused on the free citizens, and the working poor strengthened, our liberal democracy on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately became a statute for the prevailing democracy.</seg>
<seg id="940">For the liberal democracy was only possible when a complete separation from politics and economy is possible and the democratic process was imited to politics, while the economy -- thus became the world of the corporations -- a democrarational zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our present democracies, since the time of which this separation of politics and economy started, an unhereditary fight between the two, by the economy gradually increases politics and deputies them.</seg>
<seg id="942">Did you wonder why the politicians are not so much earlier?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not on a degeneration of its DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is in fact that one can be in the government nowadays and nevertheless not in power because the power of politics in the economy is dimined and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my sharpen with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is about as a herd of robbering, which is so sustainable the animals, of which they feed, decimated, that she is hungry at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">Similarly, it is similar to the economy that grows by the self-causing economic crisis itself, the power of the corporations grows, the inequality increases, the macroeconomic demand is falling and the managing director of the corporations are to be displaced to invest the cash of their companies.</seg>
<seg id="948">The greater success of capitalism, the "demos" [the people] from democracy, the higher will be the twin summit, and the greater the waste of human labour and prosperity of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="949">If that is true, it is obvious that we must bring down the policy and the economy, and it would be better when the Demos "control, as in the Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist Linke had this idea already 100 years ago and it wasn't really good.</seg>
<seg id="952">The doctrine of the Debakel of the Soviet Union should be able to regain the working poor only by a miracle as in Athens, without creating new species of breeding and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: creating the processed arms!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it, by replacing the low wages in automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, as long as economy and politics are separate areas, automation makes the automation summit higher, the waste disposal, and social conflicts are deeper as it is already very soon as I believe -- in countries such as China will come.</seg>
<seg id="956">"" "so we must implement the economy and politics again, and make sure that we are democratic" "" "democratic" "" "uncompatible, otherwise we will show the film" "" "matrix" "" "like a documentary film" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="957">So the question is not whether capitalism is the technical achievements that he has brought to survive.</seg>
<seg id="958">The most interesting question is whether the capitalism is superseded by a dystopia, similar to that of the society in "Star Trek," in which the machines serve human beings, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians "Agora," in long conversations to the sense of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it like to look like this "Star Trek" -like utopia instead of the "Matrix" like a similar Dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In the practical implementation I would like to call you in all, some examples.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the field of companies: ask a capital market before, in which one operates money, while you work and in your capital you will work from a working place to the next, and the company -- no matter in which one works -- is property of those who are currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all incomes from capital and proceeds and the concept of wage work is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between those who are among the companies do not work in it, and employees to work there, but the company does not belong. no taurine longer between capital and work, no major gaps between investment and donor, and ultimately no mass-outstanding twin summit.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the field of global political economy, please note that our national currencies would have a freely fluctuating rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which will be issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of 20 biggest Emerging Markets].</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency, we call them "the cosmos," in units of "Cosmos," -- and every government paying the sum, corresponding to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the country, in a joint fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund invests in "green" technologies, particularly in parts of the world, in which investment funds are rar.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically the fact that John Maynard Keynes had proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it had not been the technical means of implementing it.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today we have it, especially in particular against the background of a reunified policy and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world, whom I send you, is at the same time liberating, and marxist because they have buried the separation of capital and work in the trashcan of history, and keynesian, globally keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all others it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we watch in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we drop into a "Matrix" - similar to dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide to decide on politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands, and we're doing it more democratically.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You put yourself in your biography itself as liberal Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if something of what I just said, then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for reunification of politics and economy... do not do that, technological development will produce a massive decline in overall demand, Larry summers as "long-term stagnation".</seg>
<seg id="984">Due to the transfer of this crisis in a part of the Earth to the next, as we experience it currently, it will not only destabilize our Democrats, but also the countries, whose interest in liberal democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is true, then Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Likewise as Hayek, that's why I am a liberal Marxist, and how Keynes, and therefore I am perfectly well-effective.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: actually, and now we are too.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you are not effective, one think not enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein, which told you to Singapore and China and yesterday at the supper of the Redner, you very clearly told what you will keep from the view of the West in China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Do you want to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a big measure of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the certificate of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my speech, we have limited democracy for politics, while the area where most of it plays, -- the realm of economy -- a completely democlical zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In certain regard, if I may say that to proclaim that, China is similar to the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- do not remember -- we tend to connect liberalism to democracy -- that's a mistake, historically.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, liberals, as John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was especially sceptical, regarding the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What you can now see in China is quite similar to the development which we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">China now ought to do that which the West has committed itself in the 19th century, smells massive to hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I'm sure that many listeners were curious to your experiences as Minister of Finance of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I knew that this is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back for six months later on the first six months?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, out of personal viewpoint, and very disappointing, because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">To adopt us from self-counterfeit, and denying denying that a massive expansion line through the Eurozone fell, and continues to strike the development of all the European Union massively.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity to reveal this denial -- on the basis of the Greek prestige -- the by the way --</seg>
<seg id="1008">Sorry, the forces within the Eurozone, within the European Union, continues to denying denying.</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know, what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If one tries to get an economic system, which is not redundable to get through political will and authority in life, it may be delayed for a while, but if then the change happens, he gets abruptly and destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: which change do you see?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future if we do not change its construction.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: do you have any errors made in your time as Minister of Finance?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example, YV: everyone who looks back -- seriousness...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a Minister for Finance, or any minister, who claims after 6 months in office, especially in a so called situation, claims that he did not make mistakes, then that is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The greatest mistake was to sign the motion for the extension of the school programme at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honourable interest on pages of the banknotes to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But this did not exist.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They only wanted to fall our government, only because they wanted to deal with the gaps who ran through the Eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They didn't want to prove that they have been through a catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost a third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">There is worse than during the "Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="1026">No one out of the Troika on the Banknote Coordinator who created us this policy: "this was a coloscier mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: in spite of all this, and despite the aggressive tissues of talks, you still seem to be quite a-European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">My criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone, opposite to somebody who lives and loves Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1030">My greatest fear is that the Eurozone did not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">For if they had not survived, the emitted flickers will be demonic and destroy the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This will not be catastrophic for Europe alone, but for the whole world economy alone.</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">If we propose to the way of a post-modern 1930, then it will be postponed to me as well as to the future of Europeans even as the non-Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope that you are wrong in that point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Yanis, many thanks you were at TED.</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">From Roy Price, most of Roy Price have never heard, although it probably is responsible for 22 medium minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of them.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is executive employee at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">He is 47 years old, slender, has a Ivfrisur and describes herself on Twitter as "movies, TV, technology, Tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job, because he is responsible for this to produce the shows and content that will produce Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course, this is a very hard-fought industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy cannot choose any.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He must find shows that are very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he must find shows that are located on the turn right on this curve.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the evaluation of over 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the evaluation works from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows are preserved.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is rated with nine and higher, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows as "Breaking Bad," "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the shows that are addictive, your brain asks, "Where are there any more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left, here at this end, shows shows how "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- -- that should be enough to tell what at this end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not take care of the turn to the left side of the turn, because I think you have a special intelligence in order to offer "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">It makes more thoughts about the medium expressive, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they do not inspire.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So, he must make sure that it is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is available, and of course it is the first time that Amazon makes something like this, therefore Roy Price does not want to risk nothing.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needed a guaranteed success, so he holds a contest.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes up many ideas for TV shows and chooses an evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and displays them online where they can watch free of charge.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon is found in vain things you get too, right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Episodes of viewers look at this episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team that can record all.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You record when you start the show when you paused what parts you skip or look at once again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">You collect millions of data to decide with these data, which show them should be producing.</seg>
<seg id="1068">In fact, they collect the data, process the answer and this is the answer, and this is: "Amazon ought to make a SitCom over four republican U.S. Senators."</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Yes, "alpha House," but it seems that not many of this show could remember, because it was not so good.</seg>
<seg id="1072">It is only an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- since the average of this turn 7.4 and alpha House landet at 7.5 -- so something on average, but not just that which Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">At the same time at another company, another manager found a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming of Netflix. exactly like Roy is always on the search to find them a super-show and he also uses data for it, but it makes it something different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Rather than to stage a competition, he and his team sent the existing data about Netflix spectators, so the reviews they give the shows, whose shows what shows it like etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then you use these data to find out these little details about the spectators: what shows they like, which producer, what actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had together all the parts, they went a venture and decided to make a SitCom over four mustators, but a drama series about an Senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix has made a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9,1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course, the question is: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">One has two very competent, data experienced companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data together and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this that is?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow states that this should work with all.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you collect millions of data for a decision to meet you, then you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">One has 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It optimizes it by very powerful computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The least what you can expect is good television, or?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis is not working so it's something terrifying because we are living in a time we would have more and more to statistics, to make serious decisions, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">No one. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody ever comes in contact with this software. come therefore in touch, you are in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If anyone asks to go to the USA in prison and is probable, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a release is done or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like at Amazon and Netflix. but rather than decide whether a show is good or bad will be decided whether a person is good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate TV, 22 minutes, this can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results. that's not the way that a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">The data of the most experienced companies are always false.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that they can predict it by data analysis outbreaks, which may be worse, predicting -- due to data analysis of the Google research.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news syndication. success in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked flawlessly, year around year, until it suddenly didn't work anymore,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It simply did not work, this was once again a sensation, including the revocation of the publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data of the most experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes understand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all these errors, data in the decisions of life one -- at the workplace, in the dispute, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">Also I know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided Genetics -- a field where some very clever people can utilize many data to make serious decisions, such as decision for cancer</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a medicine. over the years I recognized some patterns on the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this design should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">You need to solve one more complex problem, do mainly do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">As the first, you can cut this problem into its components so you can analyze the individual parts; as a second place, set the components together to create a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: to take apart and bring together.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are just good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help a problem and understand his parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">You are not suitable to add the parts again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool and we all have it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something that is good at which the brain is good, it is parts and pieces again, even if the information is uncomplete, even if the information is uncomplete, especially if it is the brain of a experts.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Therefore I think I was Netflix so successful because they have used data and understanding, where they also belong to the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to understand their audience better. but the decision to bring out all these parts, and make it a show like "House of Cards" which doesn't matter the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this show for this show, what meant that they entered a large personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon, however, did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their decisions, first as they voted for TV ideas, then selected as "alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a safe decision because they always could say: "they tell us the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It does not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better choices, but I think things goes wrong when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful are they, data are just a tool, and in order to forget that this tool is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before the data was made, this was the decision for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is also called "Magic 8 Ball." it is amazing. for decisions by using a ja- or no-question you need to shake only the ball to get an answer. "highly likely" -- exactly here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will learn it later with a technique demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far I met some decisions in my life, with that I should hear in the ball on the ball.</seg>
<seg id="1133">However, as you know of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace this through a lot of spin-makers as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So perhaps the ball clever and clever and clever. ultimately, it is in us to make decisions when we want to reach something exceptional at the end of the right turn.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I sensitivity to this as very encouraging message that it still pays out to make decisions in spite of the great amount of data still paying decisions to make an expert in what you do, and risks associated.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because at the end there are not the data, but the risks with which you landing at the right side of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you beautiful.</seg>
