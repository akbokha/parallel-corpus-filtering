Munich 1856 : four cards that change your glance into the city
an w@@ ander @-@ old , where people are to meet today .
a pit chapel , where is now dug for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small gar@@ den@@ ers generate a single basis of farmers .
the oldest official card Mün@@ ch supports exciting stories about days .
it is nerv@@ t when land cards are not currently available .
it knows anyone who had to go to exc@@ itement because the Auto @-@ Nav@@ i instead of a green meadow showed .
the historic country cards of the digital Bavaria @-@ At@@ l@@ ases , an offer of the ge@@ op@@ ort@@ al Bayern of state government , are all other than currently - but is therefore very reve@@ aling .
especially if you compare them with current online cards .
it is clear how towns and municipalities in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Merk@@ ur has changed since the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria @-@ Atlas is a fli@@ ck@@ eting tap@@ est@@ ry , which one recognize as such as such .
in the great overview map for cities and municipalities in more detailed maps , so @-@ called great @-@ position sheets , was incorporated .
it originated according to the Bavarian Authority administration between 1810 and 1864 and ski@@ p the first survey of Bay@@ erns .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army inv@@ aded Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon was a survey of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographic survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
even when the French troops were moved with the Peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville from 9 February 1801 , they were the present neighbours who created the idea of a comprehensive Bavaria card .
Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV Joseph drove the project ahead , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bavarian Authority administration .
the Ur@@ qu@@ ons@@ sheet for Munich comes from 1856 and is like all others on the Bay@@ erische Staatsoper &apos;s website .
the comparison early / Today is the example of the state capital at the most impressive .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown .
an example of this is sub@@ du@@ ster , which is still relatively isolated in the map of 1856 .
S@@ end@@ ling was granted 21 years after the map of the map , so in 1877 , the district of Munich .
today Unter@@ off@@ ling is located in the middle of the city .
the houses of sub@@ missions are concentrated in 1856 at today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ ans@@ erst@@ raße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ ans@@ er , a leader of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today the West@@ park is , you can see nothing as an fields - at first glance : when in , a smaller part card with dozens of lines and numbers : handwritten entries from the so @-@ called &quot; Ur@@ als &quot; which was derived from the fundamental tax .
&quot; &quot; &quot; small plots show no farmers there today - but small gar@@ den@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land in Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large green area is characterised by the north of the send@@ ling .
the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 1810 scene of the Oktober@@ fest , was actually a meadow - and no concrete desert in the 19th century .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar gives the historical map an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the Ur@@ qu@@ ons@@ cape we read in the area of the present district au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen not just to the street name &quot; or from the Andes &quot; on the fan &quot; or from the Andes &quot; on the fan &quot; - but also in big letters &quot; w@@ ander An@@ st@@ alt . &quot;
yes , here on the outside field road , they once locked people with mad@@ ness .
there was 1858 / 59 the Munich Circle @-@ Ir@@ @-@ anstalt &quot; On the Au@@ er fan . &quot;
from 1872 Dr. Bernhard von G@@ ud@@ den managed the institution - that psychiat@@ rist who is brought to King Ludwig II in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and finished the tune of the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , he said the staff to apply violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , Head of the Museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who has worked for an exhibition with the An@@ st@@ alt .
for 280 patients had been first place , later extended to 500 places .
sometime , this capac@@ it@@ ance wasn &apos;t enough - the reason for the construction of the Kreis@@ ky complex in hair 1905 .
since 2006 , the Is@@ ar @-@ A@@ MP@@ ER @-@ Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ Ost is one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ rist@@ s .
on the area of the former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt people meet young people in the Munich Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and walked in a youth house with training conditions .
West lies the football pitch of the TS@@ V München Ost , east of the houses of the 1980s .
in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa don Bos@@ co &quot; was built in 2015 - in an architectural approach to the original building of the Irish house , which was destroyed during the Second World War .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Marien@@ platz was listed as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; main square &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the merchants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger alley . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a decisive change brought the Second World War also in the Heart of Munich .
in December 1944 the bombs of the Al@@ lies broke out many holes into the city center .
a big stayed until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
the English Institut , small business houses and a tomb chapel from the Middle Ages were once stood at the Mari@@ enhof , where these days the preliminary work and on 5 April 2017 the ground@@ breaking ceremony will take place for the second S @-@ Bahn route .
with the sli@@ der , the old Munich @-@ map can compare with the aerial view from today - and fill up the hole at the Mari@@ enhof .
civil rights released it@@ ew@@ arm for Missouri
the National Association for Promot@@ ing Color has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Missouri due to discri@@ min@@ ating policy and ra@@ cial attacks by the state of Missouri .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory Board for the State of Missouri , which is to go into effect until 28 August 2017 , calls for visitors and mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans , when travelling through the State , as a number of questi@@ onable , road @-@ based inci@@ dents in the whole state must be noted , and here , it is stated in the opinion of the Group .
a recently approved law of Missouri , which makes people severe , discrimination against discrimination , as well as the prosecution authorities of the state , who are disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ate on min@@ orities , to ad@@ mit the group of ev@@ asion , said the NA@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; they have violations of the civil rights to happen people .
they are comp@@ lied because of their skin colour , they are assembled or killed , &quot; said the President of the Missouri M@@ NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , the Kansas City Star .
&quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet . &quot;
it is the first warning that the organisation issued for a state in the USA .
the group quoted events such as rac@@ ist tra@@ ce@@ de against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .
S@@ anders died in frag@@ ile circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no petrol in custody during the journey , and caused by the police in Missouri , without having to be accused of having the accused .
the Council also has a recent report by the Office of the At@@ tor@@ ney @-@ General of Missouri , in which it is shown that black drivers in the state will be 75 percent more common than white .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware of people and their families , friends and staff , what could happen in Missouri , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must be willing to bring if there are Cau@@ tion money or the relatives , that they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2015 , Missouri reported 100 species of hate , according to the latest figures from the FB@@ I report of the FB@@ I , which was the state in terms of the number of such injuries to the 16th place of the country .
the traveler is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to compl@@ ain a company because of living or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ian Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) Reis@@ ew@@ ar@@ ities for Texas and Arizona , issued after the states immig@@ ration authorities , to under@@ take people for immig@@ ration authorities , which will help people to move towards the AC@@ L@@ U .
travel distances are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but at the last time stak@@ eholder groups have used the measure as reaction to certain laws and trends within the United States .
electric fence project is Elem@@ ent@@ ar
the Her@@ ed@@ acher Wei@@ dec@@ au@@ n project is a successful project and will continue in the next year .
the CDU @-@ German duo had a picture of Peter and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac provided a picture on the spot .
at the Recht@@ wing of the An@@ de@@ mann family , representatives of the CDU local authorities met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two M@@ EP@@ s .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann performed first in@@ sights into its operations in which he cultivated 55 hectares of land and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows , and also many young @-@ animals looked after and in five dwellings .
the &quot; Black Forest &quot; is responsible for him the alternative market value for the milk of its cows , so swi@@ v@@ ot .
exclusively regional it comes to the table at the Feri@@ eng@@ o table .
since he also BL@@ HV @-@ Chairman of Fisch@@ erb@@ ach , he called the Wei@@ dez@@ aun@@ Project as &quot; Elem@@ ental Project . &quot;
I can &apos;t eng@@ ar@@ able on such a steep surfaces .
the green space for a lot of work , many things must be processed with the brush@@ cutter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have been here with the conditions and the top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 , he acquired the el@@ ter@@ nal operation and acquired this without chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even if it lead no bio @-@ operation .
for mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; the municipality has recognized the importance of the fence project and is happy about the leader support . &quot;
in costs of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare the farmers would have to be supported .
one hope that the view of the surfaces could be pulled out yet a whole while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have , are people who work in agriculture and do not make thoughts on this way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers in the review often stand in the review
a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were enclosed in 2013 .
the re@@ tention area is thus 40 hectares , which may not be stopped until at least 2023 .
of the total costs in the amount of 71 500 Euros , half of the leaders took part in the municipality of Fisch@@ erb@@ ach .
consequently , the farmers had to invest € 12 610 , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of fran@@ dec@@ au@@ n .
&quot; the big advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann .
K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; you do not make a good job , without farmer and country women do not work . &quot;
also for Peter white : &quot; here the best foods are produced . &quot;
the rural conservation area ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg facilit@@ ates the state subsi@@ dies of Wei@@ de@@ ga .
the goal is the position of the Black Forest .
a pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ite is the presence of a l@@ PR of the l@@ PR .
in addition , the in@@ oc@@ clu@@ ding area should not be swe@@ per@@ ed ( slope above 35 per cent ) and must be threatened by re@@ tre@@ st@@ ness .
there is currently the proposal of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build on 16 kilometres of fence .
the rate of re@@ tention is 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros .
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump now occupies the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est character of a regime change is to attack the statues .
the Americans estimate that as every other - hence the sor@@ ption of Saddam H@@ uss@@ one at the Fir@@ dos square in Bagh@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump regime , knew what he did when he had a symbolic ax@@ e in a heat stri@@ fe with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N on the proposals for the dra@@ stic limitation of legal immig@@ ration to the Statue of Liberty .
to stay fair , Miller does not handle the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of bo@@ ot@@ ees and liberty @-@ im@@ it@@ ators would have been gy@@ ne@@ yed if he had done it .
but he touched their significance , and in particular the importance that you been attributed to the famous po@@ em by Emma Lazarus , 17 years after completion of the monument , its base was added .
when Miller A@@ co@@ sta descri@@ p@@ ated : &quot; I don &apos;t want to enter a full thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that ligh@@ tens the world .
the po@@ em , which you refer to , was later added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
Miller is truly correct but as he formulated it himself , it &apos;s not really about history .
it is about the contemporary response to the ascending words of Lazarus , the only one in which a state not only charges any old immig@@ rants , but the p@@ oo@@ rest of the poor : &quot; your lab@@ ours , your poor , and your op@@ pressed masses , which sought to bre@@ athe freely , and the afflicted waste of your rich coasts . &quot;
there was never a time where the &quot; elev@@ ating waste &quot; was better to see on our screens .
Miller did not eng@@ age in literary criticism - he clearly did that people are not welcome in Tr@@ um@@ ps USA .
this conflict due to the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural debate : it is indeed a conflict in fact to the importance of America .
Lazarus - and their friends who were able to place their words after their death on the basis - did not know that they were a highly political action .
the sculpture should display the connections between French and amer@@ ican rep@@ ublic@@ s by pointing the femin@@ ine portrait of the freedom in an ab@@ used classic representation of freedom .
Lazarus modified this meaning : in its po@@ em , the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and there is a very different name : mother of the Ex@@ il@@ ant .
the connection of the thunder@@ ous with the picture is a brilliant femin@@ ist coup and a devastating attack on the American national vis@@ m .
and just as Lazarus has changed the meaning of the statue , people wanted to change this way back to the right wing .
the great cry of Rush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a type of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argu@@ ed in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was unable to bring out the American flame into the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty is going ahead .
it should carry the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch shall not shine the way into the United States . &quot;
quite unusual is lim@@ bau@@ gh here on anything .
the importance of the statue is quite and even a question of the point of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus existed in it to see how they had seen from the exhau@@ sted , but hop@@ eful people after long and often horri@@ ble trips on the deck of ships .
it is in the tru@@ est sense to see the world from perspective of people who seek refuge and improve their life .
their statue says to them the words of hope and the welcome you need to hear .
and this is not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump ever want to know .
their tor@@ ch shall not shine the way , but the hat@@ red , which is the only source of power , ign@@ ite .
world Championship 2017 : Neil Black handles Scottish members of the UK
Eil@@ id@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two fle@@ ets were the team of Great Britain .
the performance of the Athlet@@ ics of the United Kingdom , Neil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent of the world championship can aff@@ ord a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes were selected for London in 2017 , which kicks off on Friday .
black believes that &quot; Scotland has developed something special &quot; and the athlet@@ ics of the United Kingdom needs to learn from it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it , and we will try to understand , and we will continue to find out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I Speak with people in the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think that something has done to do what they did .
the Scottish athletes remember that something has done to do what they did .
British Athlet@@ ics : it has something to do what they did .
and also with the type of road .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates , among them Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ cher , who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m route , while Eil@@ id@@ h Do@@ yle from the team was chosen as a team leader .
&quot; Eil@@ id@@ h is quite modest .
their capit@@ als , unbelievable , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a range of athletes , whether they were Scottish or , wherever they live or exercise , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motiv@@ ated .
the emot@@ ion and the real feeling , the Eil@@ id@@ h had all of course , were great . &quot;
the Commonwealth @-@ Silver Med@@ alli@@ sts who will compete with the 400 m Hur@@ d@@ les in their fifth world championships , says that it is &quot; unbeliev@@ ably &quot; that 16 sc@@ ots are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which had been reached in 1983 and 2015 .
the middle @-@ hau@@ l runners , Mu@@ ir will lead five British and two European records last year .
it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m races .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ s@@ man to observe the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games .
Do@@ yle re@@ members their first world championships , when the only other Sch@@ otte in Team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell was .
the club capit@@ als says that they are &quot; enorm@@ ously proud &quot; to the fact that many of their s@@ cour@@ te@@ ous did not only belong to the team , but in some cases also at the medals and the fin@@ als .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the special about Team captains in this , lies that it was voted by the other members of the team so that my team mates have voted for me and voted to me something very special for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; obviously , I &apos;m very proud of all the sc@@ ots that belong to the team .
it only shows how far we came .
and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to climb on Po@@ dien .
what my speech per@@ taining to chapters ?
yes , I think it went well .
I only noted that we are very happy in this situation since we have a home World Championship .
so it &apos;s really important to set on this home use and take advantage of that we are again at the Olympiastadion .
I get a second chance to go out and compete , and it &apos;s just like a great atmosphere there outside . &quot;
block from critics on Facebook : be@@ ati@@ b you not for a public office , if you do not wear the elec@@ oms of voters
the father of our country knew something of bad media .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him because of all , from the Dom@@ estic Policy to its political principles .
he shot at the cr@@ iti@@ que , safe .
but he did not put his critics to silence .
because in 1783 Washington said : &quot; the act of freedom can be taken away - and , stup@@ id and dum@@ b , we will be led to the slaughter . &quot;
this brings me to Maryland to Govern@@ or Larry H@@ og@@ an who needs to work more like Washington .
H@@ og@@ ans employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ian Union accused him in the beginning of this week .
the staff of the govern@@ ors dismissed the complaint as a fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online commentary was full of a counter@@ action with &quot; Na , &quot; and ? . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s only fac@@ ebook , &quot; said many people .
but it is important .
and it is especially important when there is a type such as H@@ og@@ an .
this is a republi@@ can Govern@@ or in an overwhelming democratic state that is aston@@ ishing .
he has the second highest approval of the nation &apos;s 50 govern@@ ors .
H@@ og@@ an is not a re@@ ac@@ tionary rotating head .
he has shown a strong hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very sent to use Facebook as a primary means to connect to his voters and de@@ file his ha@@ ar@@ less head to chemotherapy on his side .
therefore , the blocking of people who come onto the side of the govern@@ ors - which is a public forum which is designated as official and of employees who are paid by public tax @-@ Dollars - un@@ necessary and eventually dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post defense H@@ og@@ an spokes@@ woman Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse , the acts of the governor and argu@@ ed that the comments of the comments was nothing more effective than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to use the image of wheels or clips or h@@ ash filled people online that swing the wh@@ ip online .
the post spoke with some of the real people that were blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
and these are only true people who speak with their chosen drivers : a teacher , a business@@ man and a priest , no Tro@@ l@@ le .
they all said they resp@@ ect@@ ful that their comments were resp@@ ect@@ ful and not benef@@ ited .
the priest quoted the Bible in his post and app@@ eals to H@@ og@@ ans Catholic faith .
attor@@ ney at Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not h@@ ass@@ ert , but she asked them to break them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I realized that I was disappointed that there was no reaction on hate and other current News &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote in the commentary volume of the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know this idea , if a number of people on the same topic takes place , then they will be ab@@ sent by some more than a so @-@ called collections and do not recognized as a large group of people affected . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what employees of the govern@@ ors as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inter@@ ce@@ de &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to trim a message by simply blocks a critic or a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in former times , if one had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect newspapers with the critical traces and to burn , and to kill or destroy them .
but just this happens digital .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public officials to critic@@ ized Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is compl@@ ained of Twitter users who have blocked from his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question fell last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of Lou@@ dou@@ n County exp@@ ire the First A@@ ver@@ ment , according to the US District Judge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria when she joined a elec@@ tor of her Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky Govern@@ or Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from AC@@ L@@ U because of his use Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington Washington had the time of affordable por@@ tos a similar effect like the Internet .
the number of newspapers varied between 1776 and 1800 , and anonymous letter p@@ ens beat on his leadership .
and even Washington had anonymous Tro@@ l@@ le .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the people , the pseud@@ onym@@ s such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ cus , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Por@@ ti@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers , Washington &apos;s Washington decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pet@@ itions that critic@@ ized his position on the contract of Am@@ ity , trade and navigation with the Great Britain , overwhel@@ med its office , according to the historical records that were collected by the online Pap@@ ers of George Washington Project .
but he didn &apos;t put them to silence .
free speech , opinion , dis@@ courses are on the basis of our nation .
and true leadership means to accept that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort at the Renaissance Club
former Europeans number 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for the next three days in local comfort since the Renaissance Club in East Lor@@ ian hosted the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who led past year in Ar@@ cher@@ field links to the final round , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is associated with the new venue and acts as a tournament partner in the name of the association founder and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ v@@ adi .
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance Club was built , and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty .
&quot; the players will see this course from his best side , it is in a great condition .
Jerry has made a great job when he set this place .
he is a je@@ al@@ ous champion of this game and is proud of its performance here .
this is a great display window for this course . &quot;
the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is happy to defend a championship for the first time , although he won in his 32 @-@ year @-@ old career in both the European Tour and the European Tour Tour .
&quot; that feels really especially &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in South@@ port home . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I didn &apos;t defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open since it was in the year after I won them from the program .
back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories from the last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon , last year here .
it was a really special time and one we will always appreciate . &quot;
Gary OR@@ R , who returned to the European Senior Tour after his 50th birthday this year , returns to the promotion to the country .
this event will be the first Scottish performance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s always a little more when you play at home &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said OR@@ R , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want it well , but you will feel this additional pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I really enjoyed it to play , and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad , how far it has gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the trio on the field are the former Masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and the senior Major Champions Paul Bro@@ adh@@ ur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ de .
OR@@ R and the former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce belong to the six sc@@ ots on the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dr@@ um@@ mond .
admission is free , the parking fee is £ 5 per car with a occup@@ ants and £ 10 per car with two or more occup@@ ants .
all proceeds to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less lung cancer by passive smoke
in the past two decades less people have died because of passive lack of lung cancer .
to this result , scientists of the Hamburg University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) come into a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 167 lung cancer cases are attributable to passive smoke &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said studies Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison he moved to this topic in 1994 .
at that time there were still 400 lung cancer cases had been given in Germany because of passive smoke .
the new investigation is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
house connections prove themselves as a very complex
the construction works in the Vill@@ inger road are in full swing and are reas@@ onably found in the period , &quot; so the head of the station Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the area of the house connections , the situation is more complicated than thought , as in the underground , a lot of se@@ amounts , which is not indicated in the plans .
the traffic , which always handic@@ apped the construction work , represents a big problem for the construction of the company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ig@@ nor@@ anz of motor@@ ists in front of red lights and shut@@ ters is already enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hein@@ ze &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the street is closed and only the buses were eligible for passage .
Angelo Car@@ uso , Marvin Kost@@ or@@ z and Tim Kost@@ or@@ z from the St@@ ump@@ p company has been working with the work on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; the hot days were quite beautiful .

when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i is cooked , they don &apos;t use a stove .
they even rarely uses a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai family in the un@@ quiet in@@ dones@@ ian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife is usually referred to as &quot; Not@@ a &quot; directly in the chim@@ ney .
after half an hour , the stolen buttons with e@@ ager@@ ly , un@@ washed hands are taken and swal@@ lowed up .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay floor - she has no furnishings - where they also performs their daily work , such as clothes with tr@@ um@@ ble water from the nearby sum@@ p .

the youngest of the four wives of their husband were not assigned to their fields .
Poly@@ gam@@ ie is usual here .
of course you can work late too late : most commercial men are unemployed , and many drink difficult , and there is the soldiers .
&quot; no one never happens , after 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; she says .
it is a rare insight into the daily life of the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 after a controversi@@ al referendum in Indonesia , when only 1.0@@ 26 oldest people were forced to vote against the occupying troops .
an existing movement that came to independence against the Dutch rule , turning rapidly against the government of Jakarta that involves control of the region and foreign journalists or legal observation .
in 2003 the province officially opened in Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , where the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea were the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is so low as it is desert . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the province of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour car with the car rental .
there is no public transportation .
the city with approximately 19@@ ,000 inhabitants is composed of wooden houses , surrounded by bam@@ bo@@ o trees , and out of wave ro@@ ofs that were converted into different gel@@ b@@ brown tones .
only very few In@@ som@@ ites made their journey here , because journalists and practically no foreigners are foreigners .
before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ ua was a God named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not used to bear these clothing , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and indicates their lively , hand @-@ woven Tur@@ ban , her dar@@ ker shirts and their bright rock . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; previous year we had only leaves to our body . &quot;
Pap@@ ua is Indonesia &apos;s primary province where 28 % of people live under the poverty line and some of the worst child mortality in Asia .
but it is also In@@ don@@ esi@@ ens Gold@@ land .
the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gr@@ ass@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located just 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a province province of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort was dismant@@ led in the value of 3.1 billion US dollars and copper .
in addition , Pap@@ ua has spread over wood resources valued at an estimated 78 billion US dollars .
however , these wealth is a source of mis@@ ery for the Pap@@ ua which ensures that Indonesia has preserved a real presence .
a study of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort Local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004 was nearly 20 million US dollars , including up to 150,000 US dollars to a single official .
Pap@@ u@@ anian claims after greater autonomy threat@@ ens these golden go@@ ose and will be treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
according to activists , more than 500,000 Pap@@ ua were killed and thousands were ra@@ ped and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969 .
mass@@ acres in Pap@@ u@@ as St@@ up@@ land in the 1970 @-@ Series were allegedly committed in accordance with the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission for genocide .
in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful protest@@ ers in the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we offer everything in a report by the arch@@ dioc@@ ese Brisbane from the year 2016 , in the reports about abom@@ inations of the previous year are , such as illegal exec@@ utions and torture - rape and rape are more popular after another report - and the most brutal of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims , as every week happened , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia @-@ researcher for Human Rights Watch .
the screws have strengthened when Pap@@ u@@ as Resources bring an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % of Christian , but the demo@@ graphic development changes , as Muslim workers have changed from the popul@@ ari@@ est islands Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ aw@@ esi .

&quot; the migrants have begun to sell chick@@ ens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Pap@@ ua , &quot; A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year old Pan@@ i@@ ai Local , which moved into the province of Jay@@ ap@@ ura .

in 2014 , the Indonesian President , J@@ oko Wi@@ do@@ do , known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised during his election campaign in 2014 , the ine@@ qualities and infr@@ in@@ gement of the infr@@ in@@ gement in Pap@@ ua .
the former Zimmermann secured 27 of the total of 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the Presi@@ dential Palace in Jakarta .
but in Pap@@ ua has changed little bit , and today the nati@@ ves feel betrayed .
&quot; our hearts are broken because we have approved in 2014 for Jok@@ ov@@ i , with the expect@@ ation that he will fulfill our hopes that the justice is restored , &quot; says You .
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai was arrested only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is initi@@ ation in October .
on 7 December 2014 a group of 11 children without and sang Christmas car@@ ols before a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke out on a motorbike through the darkness .
the ro@@ om@@ rock@@ ed children spoke to them that they should turn off their spot@@ lights .
one of the soldiers participated in their tone , and later returned to four soldiers , the local past@@ or Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , pursued and beat the group with their def@@ ences , said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
a child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ eim@@ o , was so difficult that he fell into the coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby governmental commission was set on fire and the things es@@ cal@@ ated on the next day .
about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered themselves on a soccer field before the local police station and the Military Command Center to request justice .
it contributed to the Zi@@ ita @-@ Dance - in the circle and led the Wa@@ ita @-@ Dance - in the circle passing through Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago trunk .
some demonstr@@ ators began to drag stones to police and military posts .
when the atmosphere was heated , the soldiers was sent to an internal radio : &quot; if the masses make more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; it is called in an official document by TI@@ ME , which has not been released for local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the leader of K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ quad@@ r@@ els of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatened risk and called to rest and called the amount of returning home .
no one was listening to the atmosphere .
&quot; when I turned over , I suddenly shot in my left hand , &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the veranda of his colorful wooden house .
k@@ ay@@ ame knows not yet who has fired , but says that the ball came out of the ranks of the band gathered here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was crow@@ ded , many shots were fired , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he adds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was met three times , his c@@ ousin , the witness of the shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I went to him , seeking his body to go safely to make sure that he was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who is how many In@@ som@@ ier bears a name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; TI@@ ME &apos;s in dark mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kissed him . &quot;
the editor of the Pap@@ ua Police , Y@@ ot@@ je M@@ ende , told repor@@ ters that his officers would only wanted to secure their station , because she will be attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to defend , if people are threatened to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner Pud@@ jo Su@@ li@@ fel@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many more injured .
the news about the k@@ ill@@ ings were filtered on the following day &apos; filtered &apos; after Jakarta .
three weeks the Jok@@ ov@@ i held in Jay@@ ap@@ ura a passionate speech in which he did sympath@@ ies for the families of victims and s@@ ware that go to historical mis@@ er@@ ors in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to solve this case immediately , so that there will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2016 , the Security Minister Au@@ anto said that he respon@@ ds an extra@@ judicial mechanism to establish a settlement of historical human rights ab@@ uses .
but the talk began almost immediately .
&quot; most of the injuries appeared before a long time .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and at the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
the point is that we have committed ourselves to accept these cl@@ ashes , but there are processes that have to pass through . &quot; he said .
then , he did a retreat when he spoke to TI@@ ME on 5 June in Jakarta with TI@@ ME and said he have no plans in order to establish a complaint in Pap@@ ua .
instead , &quot; everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Wir@@ anto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accused of crimes against humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for crimes against humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for crimes against humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for crimes against humanity committed in 1999 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Pap@@ ua has already been settled , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai Pre@@ ferences . &quot; &quot; &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims were contrary to such claims with fierce un@@ belief .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes .
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says he is still living in fear of years later .
&quot; I am afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was afraid to be arrested by the military , I have feared to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were afraid to discuss the incident .
he says he was defeated by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I had buried the bodies , the military searched for me , &quot; he says .
the shooting gallery did not hear .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police on vill@@ agers in the village of Pan@@ i@@ ais , D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
during a con@@ front@@ ation between the vill@@ agers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma who refused to bring an un@@ conscious man to hospital , a person and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drunk in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
the vill@@ agers protest@@ ers protest before the company &apos;s position .
the police said that the vill@@ agers in@@ hib@@ ited the vill@@ agers on officers who responded to them by using warning signs .
but indi@@ genes say that the mobile Brigade ( Indonesian par@@ amil@@ itary police ) began to shoot and killed one .
&quot; we were so in pan@@ ic , we have fear that it will be reven@@ ge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u B@@ adi@@ i , who lives and witness in the vicinity of the hospital , so the TI@@ ME was added here .
&quot; I have hidden myself two days in my house . &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has invited to withdraw the officers of the government and withdraw the mobile Brigade of the police from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a ser@@ ene for Indonesian government .
the lack of sen@@ su@@ al development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the tri@@ po@@ orer of Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and Dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua .
many have joined the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the Reb@@ ellen@@ ia Army , which claims to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua by provo@@ king attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indonesian soldiers .
some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Y@@ og@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ oya .
in response to the past years , thousands of people were arrested in Pan@@ i@@ ai and arbitr@@ arily put into custody , under the pre@@ text of &quot; securing the national sover@@ eig@@ n@@ ty . &quot;
some diving never again .
among the people in Pap@@ ua is Pan@@ i@@ ai known as &quot; a trag@@ ical , forgotten site . &quot;
poverty strengthens the in@@ satisfaction .
the bit of rice , which is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is expensive for loc@@ als .
bread is just the same except .
the people here are all of what they eat : mainly Not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potatoes .
they keep most of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold out on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a precious only 10,000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 cents ) .
during the time , economic ine@@ qualities increased between local Pap@@ ua and the new migrants that have arrived in the hub of Nab@@ ire in larger numbers since the opening of new routes .
the few jobs , which are in the region , are usually educ@@ ated in the better @-@ educ@@ ated and we@@ al@@ thy migran@@ t .
Pap@@ ua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to introduce their own company competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in to stay in the village ... because there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the Council of Pan@@ i@@ ai .
insulation keeps the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
in addition , restrictions on coverage of international media are cl@@ amped .
at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Bas@@ ille Long@@ ch@@ amp were deported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although the rare permission was given to films .
according to Ph@@ el@@ im K@@ ine , the deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is election campaign became the restrictions on the reporting to promote transparency and development , not realised .
&quot; there are new haz@@ ards for foreign journalists who try to report of Indonesia &apos;s peaceful provinces of Pap@@ ua and West@@ pap@@ ua : visa extension and a black list , &quot; he said in a declaration .
a lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely restricted to the immediate neigh@@ bors of Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March , six pairs of Pacific states - Tong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands , the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread injuries &quot; in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have historically seen the O@@ PM .
the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Ministry of State of Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha Nas@@ ir the alleg@@ ations of the Group returned and said journalists in Jakarta : &quot; in Indonesia still a democratic system , and there are free media , so it is difficult to conce@@ al the evidence of human rights cases . &quot;
the people on site want to consider that more foreign governments should consider it .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of the Human Rights ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura visited him on May 4 , immig@@ rants broke silence and ur@@ ged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that participated in the session but anonymous want .
Indonesia has a further presidential election , but the Pap@@ ua say that they are likely to vote for Jok@@ ov@@ i .
&quot; Jok@@ ov@@ i is a man who has good inten@@ tions , but he is involved in the people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says Gob@@ i , the chairman of the Council .
he wants to know that Jok@@ ov@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from that it lives under the constant thre@@ ats of a military service , is in arms and health services .
Gob@@ i says that Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , have to consider their voice for Jok@@ ov@@ i as an &quot; debt , &quot; he has to pay back .
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they want only justice , &quot; he says .
despite the thre@@ ats and en@@ rol@@ ments , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Sch@@ uss@@ ers brought a final symbolic act of Des@@ p@@ ite : the dead of a victim was buried on a site opposite the police and military station .
they may not know that any justice will never happen to them , but at least they will not forget the leaders of their crimes .
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us says with strong head .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest residential towers in Dubai in Dubai on Friday and forced hundreds of inhabitants , from the 337 meters high , 79 @-@ story building .
it is the second fire that is running in only two years by the sky@@ scra@@ per , which is acci@@ dentally called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) .
the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we stood with the fire alarm and at the cry of the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we took down the stairs down and it took about 10 minutes to come from the 50th floor , &quot; told us a resident who became his name as George Ang@@ ab , Reuters .
Dub@@ ais civil protection authorities said that the units of fire fighting broke out at 4.00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 clock GMT ) and the buildings burned down .
the government said they work on the provision of accomod@@ ations for the person concerned .
the incident may be re@@ vit@@ alized on safety of materials , which are used in external areas of high @-@ level buildings around the world .
a study by management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the largest part of the damage from the facing , the outer covering for decoration or insulation , came .
in Great Britain , the police , they believe that the system of plates for insulation and covering at the London Gren@@ kne@@ e Tower in June may have contributed to the spread of a fire which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup reform : next Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) is pleased with his big Davis Cup cou@@ p at the Annual General Meeting .
at its meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , it was only supported for this sport @-@ revolutionary suggest@@ ion , Davis Cup single or even on two winning essays that supports Hau@@ ch@@ thin not from the required two @-@ third majority .
although often very long , but even so , therefore , very estimated five @-@ set classi@@ cs will remain the traditional competition .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 percent of the members voted for reform , the target of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty , therefore only scar@@ cely missed .
&quot; we respect this decision , but they are disappointed that our members have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup .
we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of this i@@ con@@ ian and historical cont@@ ests , &quot; Hag@@ ger@@ ty said .
you will continue to work to improve the applic@@ ants .
even until the vote , the proposal had already come to a lot on a neutral place before the proposal .
new from 2018 are only compar@@ atively smaller details : the fin@@ alists will have the host right at the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup in the future round in the first round .
in order to reduce the costs for the organizers , the requirements are facilit@@ ated and facilit@@ ates the requirements in terms of training places etc . and players will need to take less official media dates prior to the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 US travelers bring out objects into the plane , finds a survey
a survey among airline passengers revealed that more than 20 percent deliber@@ ately deliber@@ ate or un@@ aware objects at the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration shall be rep@@ lic@@ ated , including at least 6 per cent , which carried the aircraft , while they acci@@ dentally captured knives or other objects with blades .
they claimed less than 1 percent , they would have been delayed that they have traveled irrit@@ ated with har@@ sh weapons , am@@ mun@@ ition or explo@@ si@@ ves .
the survey of more than 1,000 persons - which was conducted by a jet Char@@ ter@@ service , the Strat@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also confirmed that younger trav@@ ellers have preferred the rules .
of those questi@@ oned that they have tried to fly with something to fly with something that was prohibited by T@@ SA , were 19.@@ 7 percent Millennium than , compared with fewer than 15 percent , members of the Generation X .
the most common objects that were prescribed by T@@ SA agent , were foods and liquids .
more than 3 per cent stated objects by security control carried by security control , during which 2.2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.7 percent of the male respon@@ dents have confirmed that they had banned drugs to the plane .
the company said it had asked trav@@ ellers throughout the country to find out how many acci@@ dentally obtained dirt by the airport security , and how many things had been deliber@@ ately done .
there is no surprise that people who wear on the dar@@ k@@ est dirt - ignor@@ ant or un@@ ignor@@ ant - are those who are the most frequent .
however , the company indicates that the T@@ SA directives have somewhat complicated and conf@@ using .
people often are uns@@ af@@ e to take liquids from them or how much of it .
so there is no surprise that the largest amount of the articles of the T@@ SA conf@@ is@@ cated objects are used .
a long time the people thought , the T@@ SA could look books as Schm@@ ug@@ gel@@ ware .
liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k is no matter : tens of thousands of Tesla &apos;s customers
the El@@ on Mus@@ k , electro @-@ thous@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k gives the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tesla &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
so far he has under@@ gone so far , that a part of the customer has already withdrawn its retail price .
in addition to the always triumph@@ ant figures , the El@@ on Mus@@ k boss has Tesla @-@ boss El@@ on Mus@@ k with the announcement of the latest quarterly balance for the first time : the cancellations made in the new mass market model 3 .
Mus@@ k had often expressed more than 500,000 orders for the new car in recent months , whose delivery is just start .
now Mus@@ k is one : from the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 copies , 63@@ .000 have been withdrawn .
critics always had pointed out that it only deals with no longer binding reservations .
when a cancellation is charged EUR 1000 ( in the US $ 1000 and in the United Kingdom 1000 pounds ) , I will receive a reservation payment . &quot;
there are currently 45@@ 5,000 such non @-@ binding reservations , in a telephone conference with an@@ alysts .
however , the cancellation of up to 12 percent of all orders will not be problem , but the Tesla CEO does not believe .
his argument : the challenge in the ambitious growth targets is not on demand but on the production site .
in the past year Tesla has supplied 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
in 2018 it should be assembled - all models - 500,000 one million for 2020 .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , there are 1800 reservations possible per day .
who today order a &quot; Model 3 &quot; in the second half of 2018 , may be reck@@ oned in the second half of 2018 , if Tesla creates its n@@ ag@@ ile new , never tested its n@@ aval new , never in practice the production lines with maximum utilization of utilization .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
but comes to greater del@@ ays , then the binding of the reservations may be needed for Tesla .
because then the company cannot come to dis@@ satisfied customers in dro@@ ves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EPA Group CEO P@@ ru@@ itt moves back to reduce emissions of the Obama Er@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Obama Er@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot;
one day after being accused of 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the chief of the environmental protection authority , had to delay his previous decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era to reduce emissions of smo@@ g pollutants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change when his agency proved the need for the needs of state environmental authorities as opposed to previous administ@@ r@@ ations .
he didn &apos;t mention the complaint against his previous position in a Federal Appeals Court .
it is about a period that ran on 1st October for states to comply with the standards of 2015 for floor drain ozone .
P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that it will be delayed by a year to study more time to study the plan and to avoid the plan &quot; in local decisions of unique or economic growth . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was in front of his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump At@@ tor@@ ney of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , was long time a reliable opponents of strict environmental protection regulations .
since his arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly passed on to block regul@@ ators or fail@@ ing to resi@@ sted the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels .
the sudden return from Wednesday is the most recent legal provisions for the P@@ ru@@ sion regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
last month , a Federal Court of Justice in Washington decided that the EPA Administrator have exceeded its authority , as he attempted to have the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration , the oil and gas company to monitor the surveillance and reduction of methane .
in one on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt passed the read@@ iness of ozone standards quite simply the read@@ iness of EPA for cooperation with the States due to the complex process of tim@@ ely fulfil@@ ment of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under former administration , the EPA often have the dead@@ lines for carrying out and then have been indicted , and in an agreement to define the date for carrying out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who accused the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in a regulation by jurisdiction , and we take me@@ ats .
we also take the law and authority that gives us serious . &quot;
nevertheless , the opinion of the EPA that P@@ ru@@ suffered sometime his &quot; powers to delay and all other legal issues related to ensure that the rules are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
the Republi@@ can of the Congress on a more comprehensive revision of the ozone rules .
one last month &apos;s approval bill should delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the measure was not used for voting in the Senate .
the New York At@@ tor@@ ney General Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the coalition of the States , who led the EPA in this week , said the Group intends to justi@@ fy the legal pressure .
&quot; the return of the EPA - according to our estimates - is an important profit for the health and safety of these 6.7 million new Yor@@ kers and the over 115 million Americans that are affected directly from the smo@@ g , who flows in their communities , &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot;
new York joined California , Connecticut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penns@@ , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil @-@ Oz@@ on arises when pollutants from cars , power stations , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight .
the resulting smo@@ g can cause serious respiratory problems and contribute to thousands of premature death cases every year .
representatives of public health estate and environmental awareness about P@@ ru@@ sion sur@@ passed course changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is troubled as much pressure it takes to get these sen@@ sible steps from the person responsible for the protection of the air which we in@@ hal@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from Center for Bi@@ ological Diversity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight against the ide@@ ological cross of the Tr@@ ump government to fight against environmental dirty and their particular interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Verein wants to consider approval of win@@ dr@@ yers
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sees no legal pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ite for the construction and are therefore turned to the Land@@ rat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; adopted &quot; Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CDU ) , promp@@ ted its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ eimer N@@ ette .
it is illegal .
the association argu@@ ed that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 , no wind turbines could have been approved , because at the time in Vier@@ sen , there is only a wind force concentration zone at the time in Vier@@ sen .
within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are possible in principle , but also the concentration zone causes a exclusion of wind turbines for the rest of the city area .
such zones are supposed to prevent a &quot; spar@@ ing &quot; of the landscape .
the city of Vier@@ sen had a second wind con@@ cent@@ ric zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ eimer N@@ ette which had decided that however , had not approved the Düsseldorf District government in Düsseldorf because of a form@@ att@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the missing legal pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ite is the issued approval of approval according to illegal and therefore , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Christoph Erk@@ ens , Chairman of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current status of things : the City Council again decided to break the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ eimer N@@ ette ; a permit of the District government is still standing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this point the organization of a approval of wind turbines will be excluded on this site . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the collection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letter are received since last week at the circuit Vier@@ sen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared a speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes it to the occasion to test the matter again .
however , they do not expect that the procedure will be stopped .
with a view of the ongoing procedure in the administrative court , the circle would not join the argument on Thursday with regard to the argument of the Association of Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot;
the NEW Re , a subsidiary of NEW , is planning on an area at the Bo@@ ish@@ eimer N@@ ette the construction of four ( 200 meters high ) .
last year , the company , in which the city of Vier@@ sen is centr@@ alised , with the owner of about 65 hectares , was closed .
with the construction of the four wind turbines , electricity needs to be covered by around 11 400 households - this equ@@ ates to approximately one @-@ fifth of all four households .
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
in the past summer there was four con@@ sens@@ us light for the purchase of three wind turbines at the wind park Lin@@ ni@@ ch near Aachen and a shar@@ ehol@@ ding in a wind turbine plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district of Hein@@ sberg .

Tr@@ ump reduced by telephone calls to Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the bound@@ ary wall
tran@@ scripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and Dri@@ vers from Mexico and Australia were published by Washington Post .
on the 27th of January , Tr@@ ump asked the Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto on January 27 , saying that he would not pay for a planned bound@@ ary wall .
the US president assassin@@ ated him because he had refused to publicly re@@ ject public wall . according to that , he said to him , &quot; This is what you cannot say the press . &quot;
Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to establish a wall on the southern border of the United States , and s@@ ware , Mexico for the project .
tran@@ scription of his first recru@@ iting with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ around , also published and reveal a cl@@ amped exchange .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; stup@@ id &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that the existence on trade , which was convey@@ ed by the Obama administration , he would look like a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after he had proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees in the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump ended the call after he had said to the Lord &apos;s gym , &quot; that is the most pleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
Moo@@ g Ford mass@@ acres : activists lead rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice again
a 1948 @-@ seater Ford Mercury went through a group of spectators in rural Monroe , Georgia , and run@@ k to the Ford Bridge of Moore .
before the car , the four black passengers and a white driver had to reach the bridge , a group of white men came out to block its path .
the leader of the Mo@@ bs - a man @-@ middle age in a needle @-@ strike - took a long train at his cig@@ ar and looking at the wind@@ shield .
inside shot the occup@@ ants in fear .
&quot; we want this n -@@ --- r Roger ! &quot; ro@@ aring the man .
&quot; get him from the car ! &quot;
for the silence , the silence is torn down by a young black man from the passenger seat .
fortunately , this terrible scene , which was played on July 22 , is only one afternoon .
but if a sn@@ ares are cast around the neck of &quot; Roger &quot; , almost all in the audience , they shoot out very real sig@@ h .
since 2005 , citizens come back to Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com and George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - from K@@ u Kl@@ ux Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one has been indicted for murder .
&quot; it is truly in@@ descri@@ p@@ able that in all these years , no one person was arrested - although we know them in our churches , although we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks , who helps to help the organization .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a dirt spot on a history , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bro@@ oks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former congress of the State of Georgia and a life long citizen .
it serves as a dramatic call for him as a dramatic call for action , and represents an annual memory of the Monroe Community that an in@@ justice has never been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will persec@@ utions , we want cure , we want to conc@@ iliation , but first we have to receive righteousness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we cannot come to healing and reconciliation , until we get justice . &quot;
a place of jurisdiction covers a towel on the ly@@ che by the Moore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch , July 27 , 1946 .
according to FB@@ I Ak@@ ten , which were obtained by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected of the Lyn@@ ch@@ process .
but no one has ever been indicted .
although the susp@@ ects have been on free foot for decades , civil rights are saying that the double motivation for Lyn@@ ch actions in the whole city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , he made a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice in Georgia to release their vote for the first time in the summer .
about the same time as the choice st@@ ach according to the FB@@ I of the black Far@@ mp@@ ter Roger Mal@@ com , a white basic owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , down during a battle - supp@@ os@@ edly because of a woman .
Bro@@ oks said the rum@@ our of the city was that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy , and that the baby was brought her , not of her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , 600 dollars to liber@@ ate Mal@@ col@@ m from prison , so the FB@@ I .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her cou@@ sins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to the prison .
but when she was away from prison and joined the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded by car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out Har@@ rison , who prepared Mor@@ de and arranged it , &quot; includes a FB@@ I report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is also obvious that there was a plot between state and local prosec@@ utions , which was not only involved in Mor@@ den , evidence of evidence and the identity of witnesses . &quot;
Bro@@ oks formulated it even pre@@ gn@@ ant .
&quot; it was a vot@@ er massacre , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you register and vote , then you will happen here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cass@@ and@@ ra Gre@@ ene has led the annual reproduction of the Moore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de for almost one decade .
their account is illustr@@ ative , moving and is justified in a kind of deep rac@@ ism , of which many believed in America no longer exists .
it &apos;s hard to watch and even more difficult , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ ch because we will be con@@ fron@@ ted with us all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I cannot build any relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year production began in June , and the first day th@@ ron@@ ged almost 30 actors - a dozen White and the rest Black - into a room and watched as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ played overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ ens Co @-@ director .
he has played the role of the chef C@@ lan@@ co gli@@ des since years , but he said , the role will never get easier .
&quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to get this story alive , because we would not want to return to these times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room we tast@@ ed the actor D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sh@@ aw and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett h@@ ester , their lines .
the piece starts with Mal@@ col@@ m , the H@@ ester ad@@ cri@@ es and ur@@ ged him , that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , n --- he w@@ asted my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ cona answer the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone breaks out at least ( at least all black actors ) in der@@ ision .
Gre@@ ene laugh@@ s at the silent .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; I asked S@@ cona .
he is al@@ armed and conf@@ used .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gre@@ ene said , still gri@@ ev@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think that white people didn &apos;t have &apos; n --- &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yet , &quot; funny one of the other black dar@@ ker .
&quot; you must hit the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
and right there is the energy in the room , a feeling of camera body replaces the dis@@ comfort .
everyone is busy that this is right , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed man .
the scene will once again begin .
this time , when Ras@@ cona says the N word , he says it sharp and with a re@@ print .
absolutely no one laugh@@ s .
this repet@@ ition is violent and fast .
there are trem@@ ble , sh@@ uts and then st@@ illness .
a woman , dressed with a wedding dress , stands above the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and performs Che@@ e holidays mour@@ ning Lo@@ bre@@ de &quot; St@@ range Fruit &quot; from .
your voice breaks out in every second word .
about one hundred meters behind this behind a group of about four dozen people swe@@ at swe@@ at and tears from the eyes .
the audience is divided almost evenly between black and white .
a pair is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , traveled to see the performance , many are coming down the road .
they all have experienced some eight hours of Geor@@ gi@@ as , when Bro@@ oks they go on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
until this point , the Mor@@ de is a A@@ ne@@ c@@ d@@ ote , but now , if one stands on the same country where Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de took place , the air feels isolated .
if the last notes of the song , Gre@@ ene invites people to come closer and insp@@ ecting the dead bodies .
children ho@@ cks on their heads , register the f@@ ake blood and the silent body and whis@@ per@@ ing each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mur@@ mu@@ red by a little boy when he would like to remember it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes , Gre@@ ene of the amount - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw out the Lyn@@ j@@ eil weg and w@@ ish their tears .
Brad@@ sh@@ aw re@@ ar@@ mt Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in suit , who played the C@@ lan@@ ter .
Nick Ras@@ cona , two of his co @-@ player and breaks down in her arms , the emotional load of performance finally breaks down with him .
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; whis@@ per@@ ed one of the women .
&quot; we know that this is not in your heart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you did that for a reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later the audience is set up with the actors for dinner together .
at a table pl@@ au@@ ts a white pair of Atlanta , stim@@ ulated with a black couple , which they have just learned .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski fought for words to find words which has left the performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to hear these terrible words and deeds ... of people that look like yourself and do these things , because they look like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what really done with me lets me believe that the Lyn@@ ch is still going on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , it is called the only police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same space , Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks Hof holds on his table , he e@@ ats and reminds of the civil rights .
he said he started planning the performance in the next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is inspir@@ ing in a certain way , because she describes the fear of what we have borne , but it is also a moment of learning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s like that if we learn anything from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he who does not study his own story , who does not know his own story is condemned to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ d@@ us@@ k &quot; reconc@@ iling the Wag@@ n@@ eri@@ an in Bayreuth
also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monum@@ ental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf uses a bun@@ e @-@ fri@@ vol@@ e st@@ aging of a gigantic , six @-@ story back@@ drop .
the swivel stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) shows a fo@@ ams of the Wall and the D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ d in Berlin , a &quot; Pl@@ aste and El@@ aste &quot; logo from the GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange .
before that , an open Mercedes @-@ vintage car , in which the river Rhine is pos@@ ing as a Rock@@ erg@@ ave , or alternatively an Is@@ etta .
the olive oil is remin@@ ded of Cast@@ or &apos;s leit@@ motif - money , power , and gre@@ ed - that moves through his &quot; ring &quot; st@@ aging .
the three Rhine @-@ por@@ ters - sung by Steph@@ anie Hou@@ tz@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke L@@ ehm@@ i and Alexandra Steiner - harmon@@ ised as in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; wonderful .
in Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , captured a gl@@ ar in the trunk and enter the Kra@@ wall@@ o Cli@@ que .
Stephen M@@ illing s@@ ings the del@@ ight@@ ful Hagen that surro@@ unds the A@@ ura of a heav@@ y@@ weight box@@ er .
brutal the scene , when he be@@ ats Siegfried .
later the Gun@@ ther ( Mark VI ) must also believe in favor .
the audience than@@ ked the ensemble with strong appl@@ ause .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ oster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski , who is modest and bowed his hands to the Merkel room . &quot; &quot; &quot;
great appl@@ ause there is for the Festival Orchestra , which shows the first time on stage - in view of the great heat again in Leg@@ erer leisure wear .
with tension was the performance of Frank Cast@@ orf and his regional team .
at the end of 2013 , he had to leave a Director of the Pfei@@ f@@ Piano Concerto for five years later , in which the single &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; went down .
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to have pleased about that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they noticed that the audience has grown together with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a certain way , she had said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience did not only have a form of peace with Cast@@ orf but it is also an understanding of its visibility .
I go to a positive conclusion .
max quantity works as volunteers
they work in their volunte@@ er year in several places .
where everywhere ?
quantity : usually in stone steps in the furniture exchange , once a week I help in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I already worked at school in open all day at school .
how are your experiences thus ?
great : it &apos;s a nice , broad range that I see here .
I have to do with different people with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are 26 years now , a late volunte@@ er volunte@@ er .
how does this come ?
quantity : I have made high school .
and then an engineering graduate , we say sometimes , successfully canc@@ eled .
I recognized for me that it is for me and I want to do something different to people with people .
and then I asked what you do .
make a social year , as there is an insight , there you can see how it is on site , in the focal point perhaps , really is .
and was it so ?
lots : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the social program in the winter semester .
I will study dual study , probably at the Youth Office Her@@ ne , a social worker training and study in Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences .
is it not something unusual , during the volunte@@ er service several different sites have ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it always comes to where to make his FS@@ J .
you can make it from aging sheim to youth - in all possible facets of social work .
it was very varied with me .
I was also partially in the O@@ gs , so in the afternoon care .
for me , it was the right way that I ger@@ min@@ ed me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really runs .
differently than in Civil Engineering ?
quantity : sure , here does not expect to be reck@@ oning .
one has always returned to other people , which each have a very different story behind it .
whether a refugee is an old man , who has been taken out of the family - one must always be met individually .
very interesting .
and you had no contact deep@@ est ?
quantity : I am not the guy .
it is an area that gives a lot .
much love , plenty of kindness .
there are also negative moments , but this is that life .

correspondence should say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group , known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ o , is a great concern for NATO troops in the near Bag@@ ram .
according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , of which about 20 % in the capital .
at the end of July , a suicide passenger car killing at least 30 people in a mainly Shi@@ ite district of Kabul .
the Taliban said they had executed these attack .
on 31 May , a massive bombar@@ d@@ ment in the centre of the city had killed more than 150 people with the dead@@ ly mil@@ it@@ ants attack in the country since the Taliban were forced by power in 2001 .
violence under@@ scores the pre@@ stige security situation in Afghanistan , since U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump is considering to increase the number of U.S. troops to raise the military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that the suicide attacks in Kabul may also have a crisis of public confi@@ denti@@ ality in the government to have caused the policy of public confi@@ denti@@ ality into the government , in particular , and in particular in the call of President Ash@@ raf Gh@@ ani .
EPA returns to delay of the smo@@ g rule after complaints
the U.S. Environmental Protection Authority has a decision to delay a regulation of the government of Obama , repe@@ ating which the states are obliged to em@@ bra@@ ate the smo@@ g @-@ caused emissions . this was a day after 15 states committed the agency because of the step@@ ping it def@@ endants .
the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to gr@@ ate the af@@ ore@@ mentioned &quot; ozone @-@ Rules 2015 , &quot; and said they show the obligation of agency to work with states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and that we react to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA CEO Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in a declaration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in June , P@@ ru@@ itt has announced the intention of EPA announced that the ozone @-@ regulations - in which part of the country &apos;s pollutants are to be determined to define where influences have to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - to be delayed by October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , filed a complaint and told that effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to re@@ ject a wide range of environmental forces , which the former President Barack Obama has imposed , as part of a wider agenda , which is to boost economic growth according to Tr@@ ump .
however , the efforts have triggered the recovery of the demo@@ cra@@ cies and nature groups that make concerns about the effects of larger emissions to public health .
the EP@@ O website says that the in@@ hal@@ ation of air , the ozone contains &quot; reduce the lung function , and reduce respiratory symptoms &quot; such as as@@ thma .
community plans to be community room
at the end , the decision was clear : with two single voices , the par@@ l@@ at of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ ch conclu@@ des the establishment of a joint area in the future senior residents .
in front of the discussion there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the lack of land is signed , Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
although it is still last until the Church Con@@ gregation has a living area in the city of ownership , but there is now no plans for a private investor that is home to a private investor .
for this there is a discussion about a shared space .
one of the two investors who are still in the boat are offered to come to meet the community .
on the ground floor , he would have a living area - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total price of 70 square meters .
the administration and majority of the Municipal Coun@@ ts before , such a community space is not seen as meeting point for residents of the sen@@ su@@ al living area , but open to the community .
as an example , the word of &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; made the round .
the decision taken by means of funding for the current budget had already been decided in the past autumn by means of funding .
construction is in the renovation area .
the establishment of a common room would be so reported , T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent .
the decision on the decision to sign@@ alize the investor , that in this regard , no bil@@ lets between the legs , the conclusion is that both saddle - what is reduced to an ambient temperature - as well as P@@ ult@@ d@@ ach - which makes the height @-@ height and the construction cost effective - that would be possible .
un@@ necessary , so do not just Wil@@ fried S@@ oh@@ mer , be this supplement .
if it helps : unanimously , it happens the panel .
it is not as easy as the common room .
Daniela Call to the many own buildings , with which one will not come . now , at the common room in the window , she said , &quot; I &apos;m so difficult to do . &quot;
Y@@ v@@ onne Sta@@ iger speaks absolutely common to the common room - but absolutely against a municipal participation .
you &apos;ll see behind it a covered payout of oh@@ ach@@ able or even Foreign Invest@@ ors .
this is not so , because with the purchase of the area you give no sub@@ sid@@ y , but get a real , in the case of doubt , that is the counter @-@ speaking counter .
Sta@@ ig@@ er application , accordingly to the decision of the decision , finds three fears .
so it remains with two counter@@ voices at the original program , the Stefan H@@ aller thus summar@@ ises : &quot; if we en@@ cap@@ turing the decision , we make a huge step to close a huge piece in our infrastructure . &quot;

up to star in the Harz Mountain
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Harz Mountains , the nationwide &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star @-@ path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be set up in the Harz Mountains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is planning the association Z@@ warte Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planet road in Göttingen , since 2003 .
a &quot; star @-@ path &quot; come to meet the information needs of many harp visitors , called it .
he connect nature , science , movement , and spor@@ tive power .
members want to move along the official route of panels and inform them about stars and star pictures .
in the first phase of 2018 the association is planning to reach the &quot; well @-@ reaching installations at five to six locations &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z .
in@@ quire at St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ e@@ ge@@ i@@ ß and Sie@@ ber .
the information on the boards should be supplemented by the internet .
this is why a good mobile network reception is playing a good mobile network .
also Acc@@ essi@@ bility is a crit@@ erion .
later , the star@@ path train is to be expanded by train .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the star arrow you will learn a lot of knowledge about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moreover , they learned why stars have different colors or why a star stronger than another , although it is much more removed .
also , in which constellation can be found in a selected star and when he is best to see .
the association has already been operating in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg since 2014 , the highest located ob@@ servatory in northern Germany .
the plant in the middle of the Harz National Park is based on information from the Federal Office of Nature Conservation to the six dark regions in Germany .
frequently , from there from the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a Galaxy with naked eye can be seen clearly .
since 2003 it has been on the initiative of the Planet@@ arium of Göttingen since 2003 , something similar to the planned star station - the plan@@ etary cycles .
beginning of Geb@@ a hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the inside of our solar system , the plan@@ etary trail leads with its sh@@ rim@@ ps up to the Hain@@ berg and the ob@@ servatory - as well as a &quot; ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; site in Di@@ em@@ ards ( congregation of Gl@@ eichen ) , with the planet Sed@@ na .
the sh@@ rim@@ ps of the single planet - including the Pl@@ u@@ to di@@ zed pl@@ u@@ to at the end point - are exactly at a distance and a scale of one to two billion .
the earth sh@@ run@@ k on a ball of 6.5 millimeters in diameter , while the sun is exactly 75 meters away from the sun .
the total distance of the planet we@@ ave is about four kilometres .
while the light from sun to the Pl@@ u@@ to takes about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour to stand with Pl@@ u@@ to .
pedestri@@ ans are so faster than the light in the world all .
the march to the next fixation would take half a year .

research Project : &quot; rotary chain works better &quot;
Andr@@ e Hoffmann is hop@@ ing for the 2 : 2 season open@@ ers to Braunschweig for optim@@ isation of the immune system in Au@@ e points .
with the first win in the first season Andr@@ e Hoffmann was satisfied with the result , as did not the two opponents were 2 : 2 to Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two opponents too much , and we must fit in Au@@ e even better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the defender of Fortuna Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Erz@@ gebirge , the rotary chain should also be further optimized .
and a gate after a state would like to catch the Fort@@ un@@ es even more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future there will be so that no more besides Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) will be on the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will continue to real@@ ise the experience in preparation with the rotating chain , than with the four @-@ chain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still , I don &apos;t know how we will act in Au@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is in his case be sure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have just in the three @-@ piece chain at Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and N@@ iko G@@ ie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann players who can build well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ite is , but we are even more harmon@@ ious and we are not able to aff@@ ord such a lot of shooting errors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course Hoffmann has also travels to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if one can talk to an unexpected start , do not know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the power could definitely be okay , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we can concentrate on Sunday with four points and focus on the t@@ rophy , we will certainly be able to talk about one of the ordinary season open@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of which his trainer wanted nothing to know .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the start to the season will I only after six to eight game days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who would not want to speak of a advantage over to Au@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be cancelled due to an accident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann , that the players from Au@@ e could perhaps be something of fresh , since they could not have any he@@ avi@@ est and complete play like Fortuna for a asc@@ ension to the bones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they do not know so 100 % where they are currently standing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the defender of the Fortuna . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the guests come from the Rhineland as a lighter favorite on Sunday in the encounter ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we should take away it , because we have the right to come under the first six , is Bl@@ ö@@ d@@ wise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive at only a defeat against aux of nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga which one must propose from the out@@ set , &quot; explains the coach coach .
&quot; to make such a statement ar@@ ro@@ gant and exc@@ ite . &quot;
and so Funk@@ el will not experience his players on Sunday in no case .
new Results of Swedish As@@ ylum C@@ auses tests Publ@@ ished
the youngest results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , who have under@@ gone a new method for medical evaluation of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years . however , not everyone believes on the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish authority for For@@ ens@@ ische Medicine ( Pu@@ ts@@ is@@ ite ) has begun with the implementation of tests last year .
they are supposed to be more precise during the asylum procedure , after the Swedish migration authority ( mig@@ r@@ ations@@ verk@@ usen ) , because of absence of the correct age of some refugees , which had been min@@ ded of age .
until today , mig@@ r@@ ations@@ verk@@ usen was sent out 6,@@ 880 as a test@@ ament and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency now has published the results of a total of 2,@@ 481 tests from the period from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 .
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in another 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency ordered that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
in 432 cases the conclusion was that the person is &quot; possibly under 18 years old . &quot;
the tests are carried out only in cases where the age of person is put into question .
according to Johan G@@ ö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are constantly in the past months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see no major difference in the statistics of the past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the magazine The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases in which the person was judged as over 18 years , does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ ers has lied over his age .
in May the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and told that it was 4@@ 42 cases that they may propose that it was 18 years or older . &quot;
when the newspaper sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bl@@ a@@ det out the 5@@ 81 results found it noted that in 243 of these cases the person said that it was 18 years old in 243 of these cases .
the method of medical de@@ struc@@ tors , in the X @-@ ray recordings of Weish@@ aring and M@@ RT @-@ recordings of kne@@ els , which were then analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , was also critic@@ ized in some areas .
a sc@@ ep@@ tics is the En@@ doc@@ rin@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ inska Institut , whose work contains the assessment of biological maturity of people to see if they went earlier or later than usual by Pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think that the type of measurement should be used .
to assess the biological age in this way is very un@@ certain .
if we cannot say it , we should not do so if we could do it , &quot; he said the newspaper Metro .
however , G@@ ö@@ ran@@ sson provided by the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , def@@ ended the accuracy of tests : &quot; generally , you can say that the risk of a child is poor as an adult is poor .
the biggest risk is in this case , if the person is under 18 , this is about 10 percent . &quot;
full in plan
work on the three bridges of the Land@@ straße 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are coming well .
on Wednesday there was a seven tons of emphasis on the bridge at the eastern town entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good at the time , it runs great , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , Building Head at Road Traffic and Traffic at Freiburg department &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April , the work at the same time began working simultaneously on all three rehabilitation bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the building is fore@@ seen in October and is sure that the ti@@ met@@ able is entered .
the first bridge , from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads through the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a v@@ ault bridge of concrete , covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4,@@ 80 metres .
it was built in 1900 .
like the other two bridges , she now has come into the years .
in order to ensure stability and traffic safety , the three buildings are thoroughly rehabil@@ it@@ ated .
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were erected in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10,@@ 60 meters long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has now on Wednesday morning at the north side a 1.@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons heavy so called Br@@ ück@@ enk@@ cap .
this is a fixing fixing , which is used as a operating way .
on the southern part of the bridge , a width of 2.@@ 20 meters should be used .
then the pedestrian walk@@ way is supposed to go .
this means that it is a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already provided with the patented cu@@ ffs .
a special finger@@ print feeling that requires the installation of pipes through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
for there , a glass fibre cable is also connected to which many companies are connected .
the residents were informed about the project in advance of the project .
Moreover , fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be f@@ ished .
for the bridges between the building and the collective in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg the traffic is regulated by a traffic light .
for the construction of the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ b@@ acher town entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the altitude of the hotels &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; are closed .
the cost of the three Br@@ ück@@ ens@@ ation marks amounts to 700 000 euros .
the whole is financed through the country .

but I want to try everything , &quot; so Kri@@ sten Stewart did open to her bis@@ exual .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I have seen in gr@@ illed che@@ es@@ es , I think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh that was cool what comes to next ? &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most well @-@ known relationship of the Hollywood stars was one of her &quot; T@@ wil@@ ight &quot; colleagues Robert Patt@@ inson that ultimately became bitter in the end .
despite all this as@@ sures the brun@@ ette performer opposite the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s B@@ az@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was in serious who I liked .
or do you believe me , I have played it ? &quot;
after its separation , Kri@@ sten said that it was bis@@ exual : &quot; I have always lived and seriously believed .
so it has never been conf@@ used or ham@@ pers .
I never liked it , not seriously , to be taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , they suffered from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ang show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in the school time , when she loved it like a bu@@ b : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all the girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that has really hurt me .
when I was eleven , I said to me , I would look like a b@@ b .
I really felt attacked , anxi@@ ous and damaged .
now I look back and think to me : &apos; girl , be proud of you ! &apos; .
especially the public they would not like to live to love their love : &quot; people expect you to make you a certain way and this anno@@ ying me .
and perhaps me draw some more than und@@ et@@ able , but I don &apos;t like to justi@@ fy me before the entire public . &quot;
governor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced that Thursday evening on Thursday evening with President Tr@@ ump to change that he will change the party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether you like it or not , the Democrats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Govern@@ or Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I will tell you with many prayer and a lot of thinking ... today I will tell you as a population of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you when I am a democratic governor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rally broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , &quot; added to Justice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as trainer would I say that it is at the time to play another game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised before@@ hand a big announcement at the West Virginia Rally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice passed not the democratic candidate in Hill@@ ary Clinton .
Justice , which is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
Forbes introduces that he owns the Kohl@@ em@@ ine in five countries , and have inher@@ ited the carbon business of his father .
he is worth about 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee on Thursday evening issued a declaration in which he said : &quot; the party change of Govern@@ or Justice is another blow for a Democratic Party who would rather continue to work again to make our country awesome . &quot;
&quot; the announcement of Govern@@ or Justice in history is the announcement of Govern@@ or Justice in history is the announcement of Govern@@ or Justice , only the last ref@@ usal of a party , which is from top to bottom , and not able to find a positive trend , &quot; said R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel &apos;s R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation for C@@ BS News .
CO@@ E Praise &quot; Russian Dis@@ ap@@ ologies for d@@ oping sc@@ and@@ al
the global leader of athlet@@ ics , Sebastian Co@@ e , pra@@ te on Thursday , what he described as obvious exc@@ use from Russia to a d@@ oping sc@@ and@@ al , but he repeated that it is not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed in sports .
Russia Athlet@@ ics D@@ mit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ ak@@ ht@@ in said during the IA@@ AF congress on the eve of the Athlet@@ ics World Championships , that the combination of his country was correct and that he was determined to combat the d@@ oping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes who were cut in competitions gold and silver medals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress voted on the maintaining that was suspended in November 2015 after a report from the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) not@@ ices in state @-@ sponsored D@@ oping in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open answer , a very hon@@ our@@ able presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF @-@ President Co@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire Council and the entire Congress were delighted about that Russian Federation has experienced Himself in itself , that they have some fairly hot days and everything will be able to make sure that the Federation shall be redesigned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is also pleased that Russia accept the criteria for his integration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constru@@ ctive day , and I think progress were achieved but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to use Russia , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; we must do everything in the next months to norm@@ alize the situation .
the gui@@ ding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athl@@ ete from the dep@@ ra@@ ved system , &quot; he added
ninet@@ een Russian athletes will begin with the athlet@@ ics World Championships , which start to start in London on Friday , after the strict IA@@ AF criteria .
the head of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must still fulfil some of the criteria for re@@ inst@@ re@@ ation .
drug tests are still in@@ adequate and prohibited Trainer be still free , he said repor@@ ters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council .
mour@@ ning for in Mali crashed soldiers
at a fun@@ eral in the North @-@ ess@@ ische Fr@@ itz@@ lar around 1000 people of the two were killed in a helicopter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the Dom@@ stadt under high security suggestions .
in particular , the Minister of Defence , Ursula , of the Le@@ yen ( CDU ) said nothing .
they described the two animated pilots but as &quot; skill of their specialist . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow down to this highest sacrifice according to the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old commander of Nord@@ h@@ essen were killed on Wednesday a week in the West African Mali .
their pig@@ lets were transferred to Germany and transferred on Thursday by a total guard of the Armed Forces in the Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er cathedral of St. Peter .
at the mid@@ day , only the members of the church was f@@ arewell .
after that , the fun@@ eral takes place in the district of family , closest friends , representatives of the German army and politics .
among them , H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CDU ) and the General Insp@@ ector of the Armed Forces Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
his ra@@ gu@@ ing rose ros@@ es , and the arms stood in his arm in the arm .
before the church , Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a screen .
the Minister of Defense from the Le@@ yen awarded the controversi@@ al soldiers as &quot; highly decorated &quot; and then .
the Stab@@ pt@@ mann had built the flight operations of the mar@@ tial arts Tiger in Fr@@ itz@@ lar and was one of the first six trained Tiger pilots of his ra@@ iment .
also Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , Commander of the Reg@@ iment , among which the soldiers belong , declared : &quot; if the crew could not turn away the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot;
doub@@ ts at the UN Mission in Mali was not the Minister of the Le@@ yen not : the use is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he is also of great importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country by which we only separated by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the fun@@ eral , the se@@ p@@ ge were brought from the cathedral .
when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not make information .
Prince Hen@@ rik wants no grave besides his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried after his wife .
this is shared the royal house on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish que@@ ens is buried in the Ros@@ kil@@ de Castle .
the sculptor Bj@@ ø@@ r@@ n N@@ ø@@ r@@ ga@@ ard made a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for the two .
Queen to agree with the decision of her husband , it &apos;s further on the message .
where Prince Hen@@ rik be buried , is still un@@ clear .
but he did not know the intention to be buried in his French hom@@ eland .
Prince Hen@@ rik has never made a command that he was not happy with his title .
after the thr@@ illing of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would have been a king .
in 2016 , he retired and lays down the title &quot; prin@@ cip@@ ation . &quot;
since Hen@@ rik received not the title and the function which he wanted to see himself against his wife , and not after death , L@@ ene Bal@@ le@@ by , declared Chief Apostle of the Danish Royal Palace .
where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old finally will be un@@ clear .
but he did not know the intention to be buried in his French hom@@ eland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country for which he worked in the last 50 years .
Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French no@@ d@@ ynast@@ y , met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London .
at the Th@@ ames he worked in the French Embassy .
during his later wife the sympath@@ ies of the people always te@@ ared , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand for the Dan@@ es in its nearly 50 years .
in a auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik expressed his first years in Denmark : &quot; few months after my arrival , everything I did , critic@@ ized .
my Danish was fluctu@@ ating , I preferred wine instead of beer , soap spl@@ ashes instead of Stri@@ ck@@ so@@ cks , Citroën instead of Volvo , tennis for football .
even for the Gau@@ di , which I smo@@ ked instead of Virginia tobacco , and those who had been able to have the reputation to have the brand awareness of intellec@@ tu@@ als , I could not hope .
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not to be ashamed .
this was equal to two mist@@ akes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Weil wants a pocket re @-@ election
CDU and F@@ DP in front of the potential majority in Lower Saxony
Dutch Minister for Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) is the loss of the red @-@ green governmental majority for a rapid re@@ election of the country , but he does not want to withdraw from the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because he spoke to the resolution of the Parliament on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously , the surprise withdrawal of a Green M@@ EP@@ s from her Parliament group in Lower Saxony was the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) in a severe crisis .
five months before the official date of the Parliament election the red @-@ green coalition lost its cris@@ p majority in Hanover to the opposition to the opposition of CDU and F@@ DP .
the formerly Green @-@ member El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ pots founded her step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the election of 2018 in their elec@@ toral group in Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ üm@@ me ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CDU , &quot; declared it on Friday in Hanover .
CDU Fra@@ ction Bj@@ örn Th@@ ick@@ ler wants to recommend it to his Group to record them .
thereby CDU and F@@ DP had 69 seats in Lower Saxony , SPD and Green 68 seats .
so far the relation has been revers@@ ed .
the new Parliament is chosen on 14th January next year .
Th@@ ick@@ ler said that the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether they could continue to rule in this situation without a majority .
Stephan Weil , however , does it hold for indisp@@ ens@@ able that the Parliament wants to quickly dis@@ solution its self @-@ resolution .
the CDU faction is expected to decide on their decision on Tuesday .
the constitution also sees the opportunity that the Prime Minister draws trust the trust and cho@@ oses a successor .
&quot; our Constitution offers multiple options .
these possibilities must be legally checked individually , &quot; said Th@@ ick@@ ler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will learn all the questions in silence if they are legally registered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ick@@ ler called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ West @-@ Step &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but some cur@@ i@@ os &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the polit@@ ician himself emphas@@ ised : &quot; I am no betra@@ yal .
I feel very good . &quot;
she described as a lau@@ re@@ ate of Black @-@ Green .
the Green Party demanded the ab@@ dic@@ ated de@@ pu@@ ties to the return of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are of course , of course , having received their country @-@ country , having returned to the Green Party , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; distributed the leader met@@ a Janssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the leader of the Green Anja P@@ iel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we regre@@ t the decision of El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ extra@@ ordin@@ arily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she deliber@@ ately decided to lead no pron@@ unci@@ ation in the Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even before the background , there was no content differences , we cannot finish this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German Social Democratic candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the Court of Lower Saxony @-@ MEP El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets to CDU as betra@@ yal .
&quot; the behaviour of the former Green M@@ EP@@ s in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal to voters and voters , but also betra@@ yal of Red @-@ Green , &quot; the Social Democrats wrote on Friday on Facebook .
he under@@ support the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) to choose the Parliament soon .
the Australian T@@ west@@ ens will cost Red @-@ Green in Lower Saxony for the majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the polit@@ ician &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her past E@@ it@@ el@@ iness , and in their fr@@ ust their personal interests in front of the fact &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critic@@ ized SPD @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus salvation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ and@@ al that the CDU in Lower Saxony makes this dirty life cycle &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trying to beat out political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dutch Leader Bj@@ örn Th@@ ick@@ ler wants to recommend his MPs to record El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets into the CDU .
the leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , threw T@@ jack@@ ets before , with his personal career , the result of the Parliament election in 2013 .
the CDU was the strongest force of the SPD , SPD and Grün@@ e had a strong majority of a vote in the country &apos;s Parliament in the country .
Minister of Agriculture in the Interview - How do we protect us from Gi@@ ft@@ ei@@ rs , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany disc@@ usses the gro@@ om eggs .
how could the sc@@ and@@ al happen ?
how can consumers protect consumers .
Minister for Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) in an interview with the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
Mr. Schmidt , How to protect the consumer from po@@ is@@ oned eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumers and consumers to check the eggs in your refrigerator exactly and check the stamp pressure .
the states provide the most recent information on the affected eggs @-@ Char@@ ge at www.@@ grocery war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if according to all that we know , a health haz@@ ard is practically impossible .
now Al@@ di &apos;s best possible crisis reaction - all eggs get out of the offer - because the central role of the re@@ conn@@ aissance committee is not really perceived ?
the food monitoring is the task of the states .
nevertheless my house has immediately appeared and has changed since dis@@ closure of the subject of Germany in narrow exchange with the authorities of the countries .
all information and risk assessment are available for consumers .
the trade also has the manufacturers to ensure that the sold products are traffic and health indisp@@ ens@@ able .
when the residual moisture content of 0.0@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded , these are not possible .
un@@ loaded eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time does not include local farms .
sit Production plants and consumers in the same boat ?
according to the ze@@ al characteristic , the production companies have no immediate debt .
rather , however , they must calculate like presum@@ ed illegal practices of service companies with economic damages .
as always there is too little control in harvest .
is it only on the staff or the jurisdiction of the jurisdiction ?
it was just the official controls that revealed the process .
it also belongs to the truth that food amounted and criminal energy can never be excluded 100 percent .
just this reason , a consequ@@ ent re@@ conn@@ aissance of such events and hand@@ over to the prosec@@ utor in the cases in which criminal off@@ ences can be pre@@ dest@@ ined , of decisive importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already made multiple not@@ ices that I expect a complete declaration of satisfaction from the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
is the regular log@@ ger@@ m in food sc@@ and@@ als really necessary ?
consumers and consumers have the right to get exclusively safe and convenient food .
if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ de is used in the food industry , consumers are subject to consumers in consumers .
by ge@@ ck@@ down funds , manufacturers , distributors and consumers are not in a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
basically , it must be clear : the illegal use of the insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ ds Fi@@ ref@@ il in the attitude of life @-@ delivered animals is not acceptable and must be terminated immediately .
it must be resol@@ utely consistently and with high pressure on all levels .
I expect from all competent authorities that the atomic fact will be quickly abolished .
how the financing rules of football on Ne@@ ym@@ s move to Paris
the rules that aim to prevent im@@ pending issues of European football clubs are not inter@@ fer@@ ed from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain for the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain in Spain .
any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Germain of UEFA UEFA , since the leading organization , which monitors the European game , has power teams of access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair @-@ Play rules that were launched in 2011 by UEFA UEFA , mean that PS@@ G has to point out that the transfer of Ne@@ ym@@ ar was financed without major losses .
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million dollars ) to figure out the Brazilian population of Brazil , and Ne@@ ym@@ ar will receive a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of Ne@@ ym@@ s moved to France .
PS@@ G can make the money back with security , that Ne@@ ym@@ ar signs and bring it to a galax@@ y of other stars , given by the financing of the team through the achievement of the power of the rich sc@@ ure family of Qatar .
one may apply for the purchase of players a lot of money , but must control with legitim@@ ate input sources , which enable them to have the break @-@ even point in their own business @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini , after his election to the UEFA president in 2007 .
the former French player believed that Ver@@ an who had taken enormous debt in their stre@@ w@@ ns after success , they were effectively che@@ ating and ris@@ ed , if banks or owners have withdrawn their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P passed from concentration to debts of clubs on monitoring of losses .
the change meant that the business model , the novel Ab@@ ram@@ ovi@@ ch was originally used in Chelsea - a club with potential and then invested in order to build the crew and to build a global mark - to a har@@ der matter .
during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can take up to EUR 30 million .
and even though platinum 2015 is fallen from the presi@@ dency in Un@@ gn@@ ade , his UEFA successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ in continues to keep going out of a covered issues .
&quot; surely the FF@@ P is not dead and we will still increase the rules for the future , &quot; Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the future of UEFA EURO , opposite The Associated Press last week .
although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out cl@@ ause of Ne@@ ym@@ ar in a package , it can distribute the amount of accounting for the duration of his contract .
Ne@@ ym@@ ar signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the redemption price for the next five years can be reported in the annual financial statements for the next five years .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 is the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi which is owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( then 82 million dollars ) , which was lowered to 20 million euros later - and it was arranged that the teams are limited to 21 players for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season to 21 players .
the UEFA is looking for clubs , who could try to over@@ look their financial vision by companies expor@@ ting their revenue through companies that are associated with the owners of a club .
while a Catalan company sponsor PS@@ G may be sponsor if the value of sponsor@@ ship should not exceed the standard market rates , the UEFA would not be deemed to have a legitim@@ ate income .
it was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the value of the P@@ PE was infl@@ ated from the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it has been reported that part of the PS@@ G payments to Ne@@ ym@@ ar could come on payments by the organis@@ ational committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have disp@@ uted that Ne@@ ym@@ ar World Cup will be ambass@@ adors and an appropriate maneu@@ ver for the UEFA regulatory authorities could be found trying to find out .
previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that UEFA EURO will be atten@@ tive even more effective , any attempt to handle the rules .
the UEFA had no pre @-@ preparation talks with PS@@ G on Ne@@ ym@@ s Transfer , declared the people familiar with the situation .
they spoke under the condition of the an@@ onym@@ ity with The Associated Press , since they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 revenues generated with a turnover of € 54@@ 2.4 million , a profit of more than 10 million euros .
accounts for the last financial year has to be published .
PS@@ G expects that Ne@@ ym@@ es arrive a blessing for Spon@@ sor@@ ing Deal , Mer@@ chan@@ dis@@ ing and Tri@@ k@@ ot@@ verk@@ usen .
the association expects sales to rise by at least 30 percent after signing the signature .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football player , and she tried to prevent Ne@@ ym@@ s approach by using that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P .
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; fin@@ ing d@@ oping &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the President of the La League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Kat@@ ar &apos;s official owner of PS@@ G .
Arsenal @-@ manager Ar@@ s@@ ene W@@ enger , whose association is owned by American sports ty@@ co@@ ons , divi@@ des the reservations of La League against a state that financed an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the owner and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ enger am Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as soon as a association has an association , everything is possible .
it is very difficult to respect the Financial Fair@@ play because one can go different ways or have different interests if a country has such a major player to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new S@@ og@@ gil@@ ders
in recent years Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y Bord @-@ Chocolate has manufactured for Swiss .
now the public cooperation is before a possible end : the airline is re@@ written down the order .
Swiss spokes@@ person Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ p confirmed on request of the News Agency S@@ DA , an appropriate report by the newspaper &quot; Northern Switzerland &quot; on Friday .
according to current planning , the airline will conclu@@ de a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products would test every two to three years and subjected to a quality control .
&quot; with the current suppliers Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , we are very satisfied , &quot; said the spokes@@ person .
some 17 million small red @-@ white packaging boards divide up to 14 grams a year before embar@@ king to the passengers in front of the landing .
the cost wanted to do any data on the cost .
industry volume estimate the order volume in accordance with &quot; North West Switzerland &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros daughter achieves an annual turnover of around one billion Swiss francs .
but an important is all@@ em@@ al of the promotional effect : for a biogas manufacturers it is a pre@@ stige contract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; how many candidates are given to the new call , the Swiss doesn &apos;t want to betra@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in question , only Swiss manufacturers are coming .
according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y want to submit a renewal of the treaty beyond the spring of 2018 .
for the S@@ DA , the largest Swiss @-@ chocolate manufacturer could not be reached for an opinion .
chocolate bars distri@@ butes the Swiss Life since 2006 on board of their flights .
before the Swiss signed a contract with the Mig@@ ros daughter , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut plant in cooperation with H@@ ug the chocolate tablets .
the opportunity to place the logo was completed two and a half years ago with the start of collaboration with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline operates with different Swiss chocolate producers .

blow against drugs @-@ Mafia in the country
the police is a blow against the Italian m@@ af@@ ia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning in the Black Forest @-@ Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ ator , Kon@@ stanz , Esslingen and Stuttgart have searched numerous objects as the public prosec@@ utor did on Friday .
at the age of 25 , 15 recipi@@ ents were arrested in the ages of 25 and 77 and issued warran@@ ts for arrest warran@@ ts .
in addition , the official larger amounts of mari@@ juana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms and several hundred thousand euros .
in the same ra@@ ids in Italy two persons were arrested .
in favour of the susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans the German warran@@ ts were warran@@ ts .
the two of these are expected to be delivered to Germany .
an Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ator were involved in the action .
more than 300 police officers were in use .
the members of the Mafia is accused of the drug crimin@@ ality , severe violent actions , su@@ peri@@ ors , as well as a rob@@ ber@@ y and comp@@ res@@ sive stress .
already in summer 2016 the public prosec@@ utor against the organized drug tra@@ ff@@ icking in the South German area .
between the prosec@@ utor in Kon@@ stanz and Palermo , an re@@ warding exchange and investig@@ ator of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ ator had nearly daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
the big action on Wednesday morning were also accompanied by four officials from Palermo .
in the course of the investigations , the Italian national nationals combined with respect to Italian Mafia .

way be@@ ats large g@@ aps in the fore@@ igner register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens that should not be vac@@ ant : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a report according to the fore@@ igner register in Germany has significant short@@ com@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this lead to partly serious mis@@ decisions in asylum procedures .
the Commissioner for the refugee management of the German Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , has made aware of a media report on large g@@ aps in the country @-@ country register .
def@@ ici@@ encies in the registered data could lead to the part of significant failure , in an analysis containing the &quot; South German newspaper &quot; in an analysis that could lead the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
according to the register , ten million people are identified with foreign nationality , about 5.7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
data are expected to be administered by approximately 600 foreign authorities in Germany .
because the data were not suff@@ ici@@ ently maintained , the data quality has not been well maintained in parts so far .
in individual cases , data from 1921 have been found , &quot; of people who have long not been living in life , or of citizens who have become German citizens and are unable to immer@@ se in the register . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; faul@@ ty data inputs can significantly slow down levels &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; that &apos;s the report on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the statistics of foreign citizens , EU citizens are recorded , that would not have to travel .
these false assign@@ ments , however , led to a distor@@ ted debate about the dealing with extin@@ ction , &quot; it is therefore in the analysis .
meanwhile , the Federal Government has begun to return refugee families with 16 year old children back to Italy if they have traveled from there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this go forth out of an internal paper by the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( B@@ AM@@ F ) reports &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New Zealand &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the paper it is therefore called B@@ AM@@ F , such procedures &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and infants - according to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
since the end of 2014 the practice was not possible anymore , so the newspaper shown in reference to the difficult situation .
the Dublin agreement is responsible for refugees from the EU state to reach it first .
when a mig@@ rant travels to another EU country , this state can withdraw it into the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the grounds write the Office now : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the capacity for families with minor children in Italy has increased substantially . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy have given for the recording and accommodation of families warran@@ ties .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( E@@ GM@@ R ) stop these additives .
other EU countries would also send refugees to the Dublin @-@ Agreement , too .
the internal political spokes@@ person for the Left Party in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children threatened because of def@@ ici@@ encies in the Italian As@@ ylum System in human rights conditions and a companion of child welfare . &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 Lit@@ re blood of living people living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach had already been available for other people .

the Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce that the interest rates remain unchanged after weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation the spec@@ ulations against a rise .
the Bank of England war@@ ned that economic growth remains in the midst of a family @-@ gain control , the Bank of England is war@@ ned .
the Bank &apos;s political decision makers ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank voted 6 to 2 to keep the interest rates on 0,25 % , with fewer members in this month , since the weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for an increase .
in their four@@ teenth annual inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 to 1.6 % and war@@ ned that inflation would continue to continue to rise to almost 3 % in autumn .
but they sign@@ posted that , in the next few years of interest , inflation would be needed to cut the inflation costs by Bre@@ x@@ it , possibly more than expected to advance the financial markets .
the members voted to withdraw a part of the mamm@@ oth business to withdraw from a year after Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will request time for the financial plan , in order to provide cheap financial resources for banks , although it is expected that it is expected to provide 15 billion pounds more in the framework of this system - with 115 billions of pounds Sterling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the central predi@@ ction of the M@@ PC , gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak , as the pressure on the re@@ investment of households will continue to increase consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the rate of interest , it repeated that &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; for cooling of inflation and a &quot; somewhat bigger &quot; extent would be expected than the markets are expected .
the markets were projected to increase the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
however , the Bank stressed that increases gradually &quot; to &quot; progressi@@ vely . &quot;
the Bank for this and next year revised the Bank for this and next year are 1.9 % and 1,7 % compared to the previous year .
it retained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell after these news against the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision to no change comes after the latest dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures have risen increasing expectations on a interest increase and increased GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % .
growth is expected to recover 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it is easy to recover from the end of the year .
the most recent inflation report offered low enthusiasm for households that are affected by increasing inflation and mar@@ gin@@ alised increases because the deep@@ ening is even worse before they will improve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that the monetary policy cannot be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent the income &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next few years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they said that wages &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will recover significantly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end of their three @-@ year forecast . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is attributable to the weak pound , which will compens@@ ate a portion of lower consumption spending .
the decision was made a year following the lowering of interest rates on 0.25 % in the last August after the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the sin@@ king &apos;s sin@@ king .
the Bank estimates that it will probably last four years until this will reach the prices and economy .
before the last judgment of the Bank to the interest rates , inflation increased after a interest increase , as inflation increased the pressure on hard @-@ op@@ pressed households , with three political decision @-@ makers in July increased to 0.5 % in July .
the inflation fell in the past month from 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % , although the Bank said that this was expected to go again in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said the aims at its target of 2 % &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the weak Po@@ unds &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andrew Mont@@ ine , director of Co@@ rec@@ o Mort@@ ise Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the shortest return of S@@ wap rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to become more competitive , as the lending has been lo@@ osed to shops and want to finish the year in a positive way .
the market is particularly good for those who run the existing Deal and close the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with extra @-@ free options and low inst@@ al@@ ments are increasingly popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) is supposed to prescri@@ be HIV @-@ drug 10,000 people .
patients will be obtained from September after a fight against financing of the drug in N@@ HS access to a &quot; trans@@ forming &quot; HIV pre@@ venti@@ onal treatment .
N@@ HS England announced that one before sexual intercourse recorded pre@@ positioning sp@@ rop@@ hy@@ la@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) , which can reduce the risk of infection for high risk patients by around 86 percent , is now supplied by health services over a first three year study for 10,000 people .
he was prepared to finance the process after the Appeals Court confirmed a judgment of the Supreme Court in the past year , to which the N@@ HS had to pay the powers to finance the local authorities , despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it .
the chess player announced on Thursday was greeted by N@@ HS England @-@ chief Simon Stev@@ ens as &quot; important new intervention &quot; during the National AIDS Trust ( NAT ) this as &quot; decisive moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Brigh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool , and She@@ ff@@ ield will be the first , follow the registration of people , and further clinics will follow in October , before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 .
pre@@ positioning sp@@ rop@@ hy@@ la@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) is a result of HIV medicine that are taken before having sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that Pr@@ EP reduces HIV transmission in infection .
pre@@ EP before sexual intercourse means that just enough medicines are present in the body of one person to prevent HIV infection .
such medicines can be taken every day or as two hours prior to sexual intercourse .
those who come into question for the treatment are pregnant or bis@@ exual men , Trans@@ sexual and people with HIV @-@ positive partners who have not been treated successfully .
in hospitals , appropriate participants will be identified to agree to the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner who does not know about anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment because of anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment .
people who are registered in England and in a house doctor may also register for a possible participation in their local participating sexual clinic .
the program is valued at £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract for the supply of medicines this week after an international competitive content .
the study will evaluate the entire potential of Pr@@ EP by being collected and implemented in large scale , as well as in large scale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should be the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to reduce the prevention of HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is another milestone in the more than three decades of continuing progress in awareness of one of the biggest health challenges of humanity . &quot;
Deb@@ orah Gold , Chief Executive Officer ( National Aids Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a decisive moment in the fight against HIV .
pre@@ EP , if it is targeted specifically to satisfy and end@@ anger@@ ed people , the possibility of changing the English HIV epi@@ demic .
from September to humans people with high HIV @-@ risk access to this N@@ HS @-@ financed attempt in England , to develop a new instrument , really controlled and not with a partner is subject to the improvement of many , many lives .
we welcome all this announcement . &quot;
Ian Green , Chairman of the Terr@@ ence H@@ ig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority must now be noted that the study has been carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one has left the risk of HIV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now , since the Pr@@ EP tests have been designed , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sharon Hod@@ g@@ son , Sh@@ adows @-@ Health Minister , said : &quot; the start of the Pr@@ EP process is to follow @-@ late del@@ ays and rel@@ ational implementation by the government .
the evidence shows how to transform this drug as part of our approach to HIV @-@ prevention and termin@@ ate the transmission of these life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of Pr@@ EP .
now it is important that this study will be carried out as quickly as possible in the whole country to protect people who are infected with HIV , and that they will contribute to that we are closer to the termination of the spread of HIV in society . &quot;
life @-@ life : mezzanine and cle@@ ver designers , these little Ear@@ ls Court apartment turned into a generous home
Jo@@ anne L@@ eig@@ h , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , reduced from a big house in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court apartment in 2014 .
it is situated on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it &apos;s a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne didn &apos;t packed her bags .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before I lived with my ex @-@ bridge in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jo@@ anne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I searched for something that was comparable to my prize .
I was shown in Ear@@ ls Court in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have made me love in them and made it an offer on that day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit the 1,000 square foot apartment was completely overhau@@ led .
originally a single @-@ room estate with a welded layout , one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted Jo@@ anne Stau@@ ffer and a mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , a lot of light .
that was my request , &quot; says it .
for this purpose she gave the architectural and designer studio du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Notting Hill , who had 12.5 feet high ceilings to create a home that was not only a development but also a place to life for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms superior to each other , allowing the architectural challenge to create a mezzanine in which one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to be creative thinking to solve the release .
&quot; the steel plant is pretty complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms , that they were over@@ thrown by one another , without having to kill us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it wasn &apos;t only about to build a simple platform but to make the steel so that it had the right height above or below . &quot;
this arrangement has made it possible to place two rooms at full height over each other - with a lot of additional drama .
for the mezzanine looks a classic copper lighting window by Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us about the gl@@ am@@ ous living area .
mir@@ ro@@ red gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program .
use of mirrors plays an role in adding theatre , space and light .
on both ends a short corridor is mir@@ ro@@ red to work for longer .
in the kitchen the mir@@ r@@ oring feels like a window in another room .
at the entrance , pi@@ eg@@ ged units place for all the hiding place and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a smoo@@ ther noise , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .
foldable kitchens include nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a little engineering art went there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared Er@@ fan of the steel reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important , so that if you push the door , it is very easy to guide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the cle@@ ver@@ aging use of space and storage space Jo@@ anne was able to gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land area - or how your property is estimated , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an ru@@ di@@ ment@@ ary form a real estate of real estate will perform and perform a calculation based on the ground size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they made it to enlarge the floor area and to use high @-@ quality materials that make the room its luxurious advantage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are these things you touch and therefore help to create a emotional link in a home &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t love you to electric power outlets in the walls .
these are important , but they are not playing with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment is characterised by a good design and increased square meter of some standard , which can be turned into something completely .
in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide to leave this not .
brothers fight for a real estate of 500 million US dollars in real estate
two brothers are four decades after her Italian family founded the d@@ ynast@@ y , in a con@@ front@@ ation because of one of the largest real estate agencies of Vict@@ ori@@ as , worth over $ 500 million .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and developer Colin De Lut@@ is lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul . this has brought him to the Supreme Court to clear how its property and its assets will be sub@@ divided .
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family since 2014 , but a sharp meditation on the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , brothers married 38 property worth more than half a billion dollars , since the family bought a business in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
there the West@@ co family founded Je@@ ans and grew up in a chain of 160 retail business transactions .
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
this money was invested in real estate investment , and the portfolio of De Lut@@ is now includes offices in the Stad@@ tz@@ en@@ rum , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping m@@ alls in the suburbs .
according to an agreement with her late father , Colin - von Paul is described as a master operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De Lut@@ is family - about two @-@ thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third .
a judicial report shows that Colin property has acquired a value of $ 316 million and Paul in the value of 176 million dollars .
the allocation of real estate and cash has proved itself for Paul as a pro@@ p point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the essays have left him with whom I kept for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in a first aff@@ id@@ av@@ it in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday , after several failed career , the first hearing of the Supreme Court was held .
the brothers are now strug@@ gling to control over the existing business - including Colin , how Paul claims that he was excluded .
Colin argu@@ ed , this is not true , but commen@@ cing Paul before , some owners in@@ competent .
in an early aff@@ id@@ av@@ it that was filed by Colin , he hope to settle the dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian heritage writes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs rise in the case , with hundreds of pages with aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and both sides of law firms .
Mrs. De Lut@@ is and her late husband Luigi were Italian immig@@ rants , the dairy bars and delic@@ acy business from the late 1950 @-@ 70s and bought a business in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early 70s .
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property , which opened the first je@@ ans of the family in Colin .
Colin says he started West@@ co as he was &quot; in my last years the High School , when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lut@@ is says that they and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hop@@ ed to pass her property to their sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi said often to me that he would never wanted to lan@@ de that the brothers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are not part of the De Lut@@ is company group , whereby Colin claimed that Mark when leaving the company has paid $ 10 million and Luke 26 million dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark be , &quot; Paul &quot; says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Paul &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the terms of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Colin made a very return , though he was a former AF@@ L board and after a biography from 2015 Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire was the best friend of TV stars .
Fair@@ fax Media participated with Colin and Paul De Lut@@ is and their lawyers in contact .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Colin answered by SMS to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really can &apos;t say much &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the case is before the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s very very sad , that my brother Paul has decided to acc@@ use me and to draw our family names by the courts &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 Colin in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfil the demands of his brother .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not have failed that Paul and I would like to end in our current battle , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is still in a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our aff@@ air will be solved in the near future of the courts &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; written Colin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ um@@ ps appointed new Chief of Staff to restri@@ ct the media Ab@@ st@@ in@@ ence of the President .
others have tried and failed .
perhaps John F. Kelly can do it .
if so , he will be the first .
polit@@ ico reported that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to restri@@ ct the information flow to President Tr@@ ump - including reports of the news media - in hope to keep the boss on a smooth course .
here is a piece by Repor@@ ter Jos@@ h Daw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , in his first day of working with leading employees , he introduced a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps White House which he wanted to repair : bad information leading to the hands of the president .
Kelly told the staff that information on him should flow - whether on paper or in letters , because the President would make better decisions , if he would receive good information . &quot;
wa@@ it@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to tell Tr@@ ump , super@@ vised to monitor its media .
President Tr@@ um@@ ps relation to television lasts for decades - and now where he is in the White House , its TV advertising is still strong .
&quot; if the candidate was off@@ ended because of un@@ fair coverage , it was productive to show him that he received a fair coverage of places that were to persu@@ ade , &quot; said the former election campaign Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February against political .
political ic@@ os Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; the key , Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter custom in control , according to six former election campaign officials will ensure that his personal media consumption includes a ste@@ ady praise . &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter custom is ever &quot; under control , &quot; is ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous .
perhaps this campaigns have something to know what we don &apos;t know - that Tr@@ um@@ ps Twe@@ ets contain any more combust@@ ible material without their inter@@ ventions .
we probably will never know about the twe@@ ets that the Tr@@ ump did not broadcast .
if his collabor@@ ators have made it more many times , trouble from him , then their effort was worth the effort .
but no one has consistently prevent that Tr@@ ump logs out .
a part of the problem exists that people at a White House , which emerg@@ es from competing parties , always trying to present their own agenda by promoting tr@@ ump material , which may possibly support their views from the world .
polit@@ ico - totally with this story - reported in May about the pre@@ ference of advis@@ er to bring President of strategic reasons .
this was an example described by Repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former tr@@ ump officials say that Tr@@ ump like to react on negative press parts , especially those with damaged Lec@@ ks , and that he could find out how these come from .
exactly this happened at the end of February , when som@@ eb@@ ody accused the president of a article from Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet Pro@@ v@@ ok@@ at@@ eurs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the Deputy Prime Minister K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; the source behind one troop of Lec@@ ks &quot; at the White House .
although Johnson was banned from Twitter , or that he has offered no concrete evidence , or that he is expressed in the past false alleg@@ ations , and to re@@ vo@@ ke her .
Tr@@ ump read the article and began to ask staff of Wal@@ sh . &quot;
Gold@@ macher added that the former Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and Secretary General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; tries to implement a system to manage and document the Tr@@ ump . &quot;
how did it work ?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove more effective than prim@@ itive manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his im@@ pul@@ sive self , and its advis@@ ors still continues to influence .
these un@@ changeable factors make wa@@ it@@ ys mission very difficult .
Master wanted bur@@ gl@@ ar get the post of Europ@@ ol
since the address is unknown , the help of the people will pray and hopes for the help of the people .
the police in the whole of Europe will be shipped in this summer ( virtual ) postcards to dangerous crimin@@ als on the run .
since the addresses of the requested sword crimin@@ als are not well @-@ known , references from the population will hope and pray .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Europ@@ ol reported on Friday from the promotion to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU Most W@@ an@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Advent calendar from winter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the experiences had shown that many vol@@ at@@ ile in vacation dist@@ ill@@ ations , it was the part of Europ@@ ol .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I compiled 21 postcards from selected bur@@ gl@@ ers from 21 EU countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2016 there has been the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ ria , has been viewed more than 2.5 million times .
36 of the online so@@ iling could have been arrested , at least eleven of which are due to the publication based on the website .
trav@@ ellers negoti@@ ate over a tr@@ ench and return back to the &apos; million@@ th row &apos;
some of the we@@ al@@ thi@@ est house owners of West Mid@@ lands are back with some spont@@ aneous trav@@ ellers on war , which have tra@@ ded one out of the municipality in order to re@@ claim a field in front of her mist@@ ress .
the trav@@ ellers have par@@ ked their 20 carav@@ ans on a field outside of a we@@ al@@ thy street of Soli@@ s , which is called the &quot; million@@ th row . &quot;
they have horses , babies , and an army of transports only after they had been thrown out in May , without having rejected by the Council of excav@@ ations to prevent their inci@@ dents .
the tac@@ tile group found a gap in the defense plants and pressed their vehicles by a section , which remained un@@ handic@@ apped to find a way .
the inhabitants of Soli@@ s have op@@ pressed the Council of Soli@@ s that it is &quot; us@@ eless &quot; to deal with the problem . &quot;
an anonymous inhabit@@ ant said : &quot; they were going to go there on Monday evening after they were driven by Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones onto the pass@@ ers .
the Council must be forced by s@@ am to implement in fact since he was able to use the problem in dealing with the problem .
the trav@@ ellers were in May there , were moved on and are now back again .
last night more , even more . &quot;
she added : &quot; the Council of Birmingham know how to circum@@ navigate the long instructions to protect their parks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I live in the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to pay my communal tax if the Council can &apos;t stop it once . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a resident who didn &apos;t want to be called , said : &quot; it is ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous , we just have seen the last round of this trav@@ eller to be sack@@ ed by another round .
the numbers have risen this time and you even saw a horse in the park area . &quot;
a spokes@@ person for the Council of Soli@@ s said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the country beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary steps to move it as quickly as possible .
in order to support our collection , it is very important that if possible , if possible , if possible , if possible , there will be an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour in the police by calling them 101 .
this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we must do our case . &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof becomes Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is opened .
the house in front of the Freu@@ den@@ stadt has been renovated and will be reopened on March 1 , next year .
this is good news for the city .
because with the closing of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof by the then ambi@@ ence of the temporary operating company mbH about 30 000 overn@@ ights per year were lost and also income by the local tax .
in the fall of 2014 , in view of the dramatic numbers of refugees , which came in the County , the hotel building was offered to the Land@@ rat , as a collective apartment , which provided for controversi@@ al discussions .
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers through the placement of a development plan to secure the area as a hotel site .
the decision was not un@@ disp@@ uted at that time .
but especially Freu@@ den@@ stadt Julian Oss@@ wald def@@ ended the hotel site and talked about serious interested parties to the house at that time .
he should keep right .
the Group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ otels with headquarters in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ians bought the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof at a volunte@@ er auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three @-@ star plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ stadt .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Her@@ ren@@ al@@ b .
you are hot Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ is@@ en@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof at the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof , there have been a long time construction container ahead of the entrance , and when you enter the house becomes clear , what extensive renov@@ ations are made .
the so@@ ils were torn out , bl@@ ank@@ ets into part , old tu@@ bs from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
until March there is still much to do .
&quot; it is actually a nice hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is converted , new window will be installed .
everything meant to be &quot; nice to close &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer .
&quot; we want to make one piece of jewelry . &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and meeting room are part of the facilities .
it would not be positioned at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but emphas@@ izes shaft levels already on a high level of the city .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its about 60 rooms would spread its width and explains the sc@@ iss@@ ors .
both individual holiday , groups or business persons must feel beneficial in the hotel .
talks with O@@ B Julian Oss@@ wald and Tourism director Michael K@@ rau@@ se already led , so sh@@ erer .
the performances of the city are equal to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
after the height of investment , Thomas Sch@@ erer wants to fit perfectly exactly .
almost less than a million euros , it is charged .
the outdoor installations are also attached to the front , this is already clearly visible .
in an inner courtyard , a large terrace , which is publicly accessible from the restaurant , which will be publicly accessible .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia Aff@@ air : us special US special Jury sets a Grand Jury
in the Russian Aff@@ air by US President Donald Tr@@ ump is alleged to have a special Jury called Robert Mu@@ eller after a review of a so @-@ called Grand Jury .
in the past few weeks the board enrolled in the past few weeks wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; which trusted in the cause of confi@@ dential .
the newspaper evaluated the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller has expanded its investigations and intensi@@ fied .
the CN@@ N Tran@@ sm@@ itter reported that , in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s el@@ dest son and a Russian lawyer .
us secret services accused the Kre@@ m@@ lin to have been incorporated specifically to the 2016 presidential campaign .
Mu@@ eller exam@@ ines whether there were abor@@ tions between Tr@@ um@@ ps elec@@ toral team and Moscow .
in the focus of the investigation , several men are to stand in the election campaign as an advisor of the rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
according to report , Mu@@ eller also grew more and more Tr@@ um@@ ps private and business environment among the micro@@ scope .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote some weeks ago that the special @-@ medi@@ ator tr@@ ump personally put into the centre and submit it to the advance , whether the President may have handic@@ apped the j@@ udi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the aff@@ air . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main task of Grand Law@@ ys is to check this evidence in possible fail@@ ures and decide whether the charge should be charged .
Grand Law@@ ys will therefore also be called .
mostly they are turned on if it is larger and controversi@@ al cases .
the procedure is always behind closed doors .
furthermore , the board can also be turned on by public prosec@@ utor to invite people to the hearing of E@@ id .
according to the CN@@ N transmitter , pre @-@ charges were exhibited in order to turn the meeting between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
persons who were involved in the meeting are subject to a statement in the report .
you should also serve documents .
besides Tr@@ ump J@@ r. there were also Tr@@ um@@ ps Consult@@ ant and law @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner as well as his dam@@ aging election campaign Paul Man@@ a@@ fort .
right @-@ wing doctors said on Thursday evening in the US television that the goal show that Mu@@ eller is not in@@ timi@@ dated in his work , and that it should be necessary to take action quickly .
but it must not necessarily call that the Grand Jury will be on the end to decide on the survey of an indictment .
however , the implementation of the committee on the start of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason to concern the concern for President Tr@@ ump .
in the midst of the new re@@ vel@@ ations , the President on Thursday evening received a speech in West Virginia to present the Russia aff@@ air as campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the theme give the Democrats a way to feel &quot; feel good , because they have nothing else to talk about that they can speak . &quot;
his special advis@@ er T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in a position he knows nothing from the creation of a Grand Jury .
but these work is usually in secret , he stressed .
the White House advoc@@ ates any measures to accelerated the work of the special issue in &quot; fair &quot; manner .
the former FB@@ I boss James Com@@ ey has said three times that he could not be determined by the president .
we have no reason to accept that something changed , it &apos;s stated in the declaration .
however , Mu@@ eller was only used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had been fired .
because of this rein@@ forces , pre @-@ alleg@@ ations had become pet@@ iti@@ vely , he had to inter@@ ven@@ ous the j@@ udi@@ ci@@ ary .
Com@@ ey said in June before a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump have asked him about a setting of investigations against the then national security consultant Michael Fl@@ ynn .
the president stands for investigation under pressure .
according to the US media , the White House has collected materials against the Sonder@@ er@@ anc@@ ell@@ or and his staff .
this dis@@ band@@ ed spec@@ ulations about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller put away .
other than an independent special counsel of the congress , as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate aff@@ air around the later rec@@ alled President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could be fired by the President of the Ministry of Justice .
multiple Sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
two groups of republi@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators were put into account on Thursday , after which special er@@ medi@@ ator could not be dismissed more so easy .
Antar@@ c@@ tica : giant Eis@@ berg drives in Antar@@ c@@ tica
in the West@@ ant@@ ar@@ ctic a gigantic Eis@@ berg has solved just seven times of the Berlin@@ s from the s@@ esho@@ e .
this was shared by the Kor@@ ven@@ er Alfred Weg@@ ener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the more than a trillion tonnes heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometer large Kol@@ oss t@@ oss now to the north and will need to be two , three years until it is melted .
with a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometers , the researchers have registered in the last three decades .
there is no danger for human beings from him .
to what extent the climate change played a role in the demol@@ ition of the ice age , after research the information is un@@ clear .
a total of 30 years , however , there has been a series of unusual cr@@ um@@ ps in the region , writes the US research center for snow and ice ( NS@@ IDC ) in a fact .
according to many researchers , the global warming could be associated with global warming .
the broken col@@ oss@@ us had so far been part of Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is .
Sh@@ el@@ fe@@ is flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by large gl@@ ac@@ iers .
it is thus growing steadily into the sea and breaks out regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is located south of South America at the top of the ant@@ ar@@ ctic Peninsula .
North of this sh@@ el@@ bow was the balance of w@@ ax@@ ing and breaking off some years ago .
a complete scra@@ per is broken there , writes A@@ WI @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
there is quite a lot to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is in danger , because the front edge has never withdrawn so far as currently .
Moreover , the ice plate stand under voltage and can be broken in case of a piece of keys .
the melting of sh@@ el@@ fe@@ is and ice@@ berg increases the level above sea level , as they swim in the water and p@@ ush@@ es much water as it yields even after the melting itself .
however , the loss of the s@@ esho@@ e leads the gl@@ ac@@ iers directly to the sea and can run much faster than before .
it could possibly increase the sea level , but only in the low degree , the British research project for the observation of Antar@@ c@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) .
according to A@@ WI , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is the fourth largest Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is of Antar@@ c@@ tica , with nearly 50 000 square kilometres .
at the junction from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , on the front edge to the free ocean some 200 meters .
there it starts regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural occurr@@ ence and has no direct connection to climate change , the ice plate has now come into a end@@ anger@@ ing position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ Le@@ ary from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University .
&quot; this is the most broad@@ est retreat since the beginning of the record , &quot; he confirmed it .
under scientists it is controversi@@ al if the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sh@@ el@@ fe@@ is now grow back and possibly merge , his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development may last decades .
even if this researchers have caused the demol@@ ition of this gigantic iron ore not to climate change , so the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have fallen in recent decades .
this long stop of Antar@@ c@@ tica extends towards South America .
according to data of the research programme British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the ice surface of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have declined by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s .
the increase in temperature increase has contributed to the decline .
the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have in the past 50 years , war@@ med around three degrees and tell the areas where the temperature in the fastest pit .
CDU wants front door to the staff
because it is increasingly difficult to occupy free spaces , the CDU was decided from the employer of the employer to become more attractive .
just before the summer break the Kre@@ ist@@ ag has reached 41 new jobs in the administration .
more than 1100 employees and officials are working for the county administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
at once , 17 trainees have their first working day behind .
the teaching positions at the circuit are obviously very cov@@ eted .
some 620 applications were reported to be recorded in this year .
nevertheless , the circuit still lack staff to cope with the increased requirements and tasks .
at present there are not at the circle M@@ ett@@ mann as before 50 .
amongst other things doctors and engineers and forces of the general administration are sought .
the CDU wants to take the initiative in the Kre@@ ist@@ ag together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG had to take the initiative and to meet the professionals in management .
following the request of the parties &quot; a concept for personnel and staff development is planned . &quot;
the goal is to cover non @-@ short periods of skilled workers , but future @-@ oriented applic@@ ability .
the overall concept should be reflected in the inside and outside , specific measures for trans@@ mitting beginners and include an exempl@@ ary offensive , ask for the CDU , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
that sounds just after a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personal problems which one did not recognize earlier .
other towns are good civil servants and employees provide more attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the talk is of a real &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of public employer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , a large number of employees , the disease or age restriction came out of the service .
highest time for hand , so that not even more places remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter People , leader of the CDU , continues with his party even beyond the common application .
he had long ago already in the Kre@@ ist@@ ag for a f@@ ist thick surprise when he posed the number of recru@@ itment publicly in question and the rest of the parties .
peoples wants to be checked all the possibilities that allow a withdrawal from the public authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we don &apos;t come short to a satisfactory solution here , the district management with the unions - may also be in cooperation with the localities in the city - a home @-@ house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus the CDU , employees and officials try to pay better than the tari@@ ffs for public service .
the sal@@ aries are currently pre @-@ written , enh@@ ancements or more money , there is only if you changes to a higher level who is oriented towards professional years .
but the tasks of the circle has grown steadily over the past years .
only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stit@@ ching protection law .
not least by the rising number of asylum seek@@ ers Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Cir@@ cular Director Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little personnel .
Italy tigh@@ tened the tone to NGO migran@@ t rescue boats
Italy has war@@ ned NGOs who use the rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , war@@ ned that they do not continue to continue to keep new rules for their operations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue to work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Minister of Interior Marco Min@@ n@@ iti said in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Min@@ nit@@ is warning came one day after the Italian authorities conf@@ is@@ cated a boat of the German aid organisation &apos; Youth R@@ ettet &apos; , because their team had worked effectively with tra@@ ff@@ ic@@ kers in a way that facilit@@ ated the illegal immig@@ ration .
the charity organization , which is only in operation since one year , refused to express himself to an exec@@ uting of Italian citizen of Am@@ bro@@ gio Cart@@ osi@@ o .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , the saving of human life is our top priority . so we &apos;re sorry that we are not able to operate at the moment in the search and rescue zone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organization in an opinion about social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can do all alleg@@ ations that are currently raised only after we have collected all the information and judge the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had super@@ vised the boat from &apos; Youth R@@ ettet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October .
it is thought that his crew of ding@@ h@@ y migrants are on board that can be delivered directly from tra@@ ff@@ ic@@ kers , and that the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers can be used to re@@ use the ships .
at least one such meeting point was report@@ edly found only 1.3 miles before the Libyan coast , according to the files of the government , whose contents of Italian media was published .
the crew is suspected of susp@@ end on the authority of the Italian coastal zones that monitors rescue operations in the zone of humanitarian reasons and not from any other moti@@ ves .
under the Code of conduct needs boats like the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , mainly a Italian police officer , which monitors their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue service , have so far been prepared to keep in the code : Save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be un@@ necessary , but acceptable , since they would have no &quot; essential changes or Dis@@ abilities &quot; of their rescue activities .
among those who refused to sign is the Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ate Organization ( MS@@ F ) .
Min@@ n@@ iti said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue measures in Italy had declined in the past few weeks to strengthen the efforts to strengthen Libya &apos;s coastal zones and the cooperation with local citizens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last days we started to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month about economic development initiatives and with C@@ ad , Niger and Mali about measures to reduce the number of migrants who left these countries in hope to reach Europe .
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
nine W@@ eil@@ mer B@@ iker , the &quot; Berlin Foreign post &quot; and two guest driver met in Wach@@ enheim in the northern Palat@@ inate for four days to enjoy the Tri@@ als and S@@ ights .
there were three kindly available Gui@@ des available .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ enh@@ eimer Valley proved to be a good starting point for touring .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est from Wach@@ enheim was a welcome extra .
the first tour led along hot summer temperatures along the vineyards towards the Micha@@ el@@ sk@@ ap@@ elle above D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim .
it followed view points , partly on towers , of which one could look far beyond the pe@@ eling forest and the previous levels .
between there always was longer asc@@ ents for the long tri@@ athlon .
on the second day there went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to Sal@@ ine and the Volks@@ fast Wur@@ st@@ markt .
again the view point to the view@@ point , connected by &quot; flo@@ wi@@ ge &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents .
in the last two days many al@@ ti@@ meter were told .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and arrangements were welcome .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ ker in the free@@ u@@ ft@@ in@@ hal@@ atorium healing Sole .
he was also controlled in Neustadt .
after 173 kilometers and almost 4500 meters , the group had learned the pe@@ eling forest from his best side - sporty and cultural .
console instead of lawn - Bundesliga ready for E @-@ sport
sit the sports stars in front of computer consoles , rather than to fight for wind and weather about the stadium race ?
fact is : E @-@ Sports has long been a serious business to become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - large stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high levels .
this also recognized the first federal states that increasingly eng@@ age in this area .
the V@@ f@@ L Wolfsburg won the beginning of July 2015 followed by the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last of the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , which founded an E @-@ sport department and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to thr@@ illed all new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Managing Board Jochen R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is safe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that on this train many clubs are rising . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
next weekend , FIFA World Trade Association organis@@ es the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; competing in the Gam@@ er of several clubs in London .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfsburg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Eindhoven are qualified .
Robin D@@ utt is also looking for a great potential in E @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ Trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen has now a agency for virtual football player .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real soccer must check out in particular with the 14 to 30 year old , that the young people still go into the stadium , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 52 year old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : trying to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian region .
with prominent e @-@ sports@@ men , you could find online far more often on these markets than once a year , to send the Federal g@@ am@@ ity to Asia only once a year .
what is it exactly ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; during e @-@ sport , computer games like &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; soccer simulation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the competition level . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the normal sport they have long , Li@@ gen is long @-@ established in which the professionals compete against each other .
and with Asia , E @-@ sport already is part of the official programme .
but is it all about a kind of sport ?
for many , the performance is safe .
also Ingo F@@ rob@@ atic has also made a long time with the question .
for the professor at the German Sports@@ - School in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport , because it is competent and many biological and physical reactions show , which can be found in classic sports - for example , increased heart rate , stress reactions , hor@@ m@@ onal changes .
in addition , it need to cogn@@ itive skills , an technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a fast response .
professional gam@@ ers should not only exercise on the console but also exercise their bodies and attention to nutrition .
&quot; the f@@ atten@@ ed player is a good player . &quot;
f@@ rob@@ atic but also problems : &quot; d@@ oping is getting more a topic . &quot;
controls be difficult for online gaming , and in the scene failed to lack the structures of classical sports .
scientists have the high integ@@ rative effect of the E @-@ Sports .
players are internationally on the way , that &apos;s like a big global family , there is no intercultural shirts .
a study by the consulting firm Del@@ o@@ itte and the German Association of Interactive Entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) tells the E @-@ Sport a rapid growth in advance .
in 2016 , we have implemented 50 million euros in Germany , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ing and great tournaments .
in three years , sales are expected to be 130 million .
against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the soccer league , this is little .
however , the E @-@ sport &quot; is no longer far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice @-@ hockey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte Consult@@ ant .
International are already far@@ ther .
great markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball player Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez will participate in the US Team N@@ RG @-@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton K@@ ut@@ cher is investing in the e@@ Sport @-@ Wet@@ tan@@ ker Uni@@ kr@@ n .
also in Europe alone a lot .

Michelle Carter sentenced to suicide in Michelle because of the texts by Conrad Roy
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years , because she encour@@ ages her boy@@ friend by lyrics and calls for suicide .
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her sentence behind G@@ nights and five years were exposed on prob@@ ation .
on 13 July 2014 , Carter was sentenced to Conrad Roy in June because of the negli@@ gence of Conrad Roy .
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is un@@ comfort .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to stay free until appeal .
she was con@@ fron@@ ted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but their legal representatives were argu@@ ed that both she had suffered from a mental illness .
clothed in red tro@@ users and a cream coloured bl@@ ouse , Carter , with tears in his eyes , with folded hands and down eyes when they was condemned .
&quot; their actions have killed Conrad Roy , &quot; said the prosec@@ utor in the court .
&quot; she finished his life to make her own better .
she has no responsibility , &quot; she said .
&quot; she has no regre@@ t . &quot;
but Car@@ ter &apos;s lawyer said that it is a &quot; terrible insur@@ rection , which they completely regre@@ t . &quot;
judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz spoke , however , he didn &apos;t find out that you have &quot; ages or ri@@ pen@@ ess or even their spiritual disease a significant influence on their actions . &quot;
a prosec@@ utor reading a statement by Ro@@ ys mother Lyn@@ n Roy , the af@@ ore@@ mentioned that there is no day when I smo@@ ked the loss of my beloved son .
I would like that he is proud of me and as I go with everything . I tried , despite all my sor@@ rows that we will bear for eternity with us , for his sisters , it is called it .
Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ d@@ yn Roy , said that they will never be able to participate in the wedding of their brother or would never be a a@@ unt of his children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not for this one person , with whom I have been together for my birth every day , is a pain that I always kept for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to put an justi@@ fication case since there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to demand for another , suicide .
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by an carbon mon@@ oxide po@@ is@@ oning in a vehicle in 2014 .
the case referred to national attention after Car@@ ters &apos;s passages that she encour@@ ages him to stop his life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lift up yourself , spring from a building , I know not , there are many ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said in several news that she had sent them in the two weeks before his death , while he was on holiday with his family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the eyes look before his suicide she wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must do it , Conrad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; All that you must do is to enter the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz told that Carter sought attention through the death of Roy and ordered that they should benefit through any media from the case .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
among the few those who def@@ ended Carter , Am@@ anda Knox , who was convicted in Italy for murder on their British co @-@ inhabitants in 2007 , before being acquitted two years ago .
Ms. Knox , 30 Years old , published a comment on the Los Angeles Times in the Los Angeles Times . Michelle Carter deserv@@ es compassion and help .
Joshua K@@ imm@@ ich : learning from the new Mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua K@@ imm@@ ich had been running at the Audi Cup as a captain , is not a co@@ incidence .
the FC Bayern aut the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup @-@ winner a big season - Extra motivation does not end@@ ure there .
anything else was on his place in the cabin , that looked Joshua K@@ imm@@ ich immediately , even if the additional clothes is very small , very small .
but as far as wide and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups there is not a Philipp Lah@@ m and also no Manuel New to see him , he made his letter to his arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trainer has not announced it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; telling the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winners &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after its first use as Bavaria @-@ Captain &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
good that would have better run than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the character of the coach could also de@@ mar@@ vel so .
not the eight year old Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal was born out of youth players , de@@ but@@ ors and just chosen from the work of the professionals existing C @-@ El@@ f as guide leader , but he .
sugar is distributed over to those who want to keep plenty of women who want to keep in mood .
so who has been out to compete for the H@@ Lah@@ m &apos;s heir , a small extra motivation can only use well @-@ used .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ imm@@ ich confirmed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what you want as a player : responsibility &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old was a mini @-@ Lah@@ m over the field .
right behind , that &apos;s its position , the white bonds on the arm did its rest .
and ever I worked in this starting information such as the one who can take the ru@@ d@@ der into the hand .
he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ installed troops .
he had a look for the whole , while many others were busy himself .
Vi@@ dal so , his missing fitness to over@@ play ( folded scar@@ cely ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches rely on the devil and join the services of the Asia trip ( folded down only ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le so in their first appearance in Bavaria @-@ Trieste do not fall negative .
it all works quite well .
Sü@@ le ran alongside K@@ imm@@ ich , Rud@@ y before the defense , both ag@@ ulated sover@@ eign .
the nam@@ ing occupied Nap@@ oli @-@ storm frequently did heavily . in addition , Sü@@ le tried to try a few times in the body building .
his colleague Rud@@ y said that the result &quot; was not so , as we hop@@ ed that . &quot;
but he also showed an ordinary performance in the debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; play@@ able , speed change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this style I was brought well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as un@@ used this Bayern world still exists for new standards , you looked at the connection to the game .
Rud@@ y for example was not one or two , but definitely six or seven interviews .
K@@ imm@@ ich passed after a few cris@@ p statements in the back of his new players .
there he heard of Sü@@ le an interesting set : &quot; what &apos;s going on here I already noticed .
in Bavaria you simply have to win any game . &quot;
nevertheless , it must not have the new one more .

enterprise satisfied with Rhineland @-@ care Minister : Wirtschaft im W@@ iss@@ ings Tempo
it was often un@@ conc@@ ili@@ atory , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as Ev@@ eline Lem@@ ke ( founder ) still Minister of Economics of Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
this shows itself after more than one year , in which the new Minister of Economic Affairs Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak to T V @-@ request of a change in economic policy - and t@@ add@@ ling the old Minist@@ erial .
Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer Company ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wis@@ sing pra@@ ises the wishes of the economy , the Lem@@ ke all has blocked . &quot;
the largest day of swe@@ at sees Nat@@ us in the infrastructure policy : the bridge connection of the highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au stands at the preferred list of the country now .
still this year , the Ministry is hop@@ ing for a planning process , until 2021 the building is scheduled .
a role in the plans of the country also plays the western part of Trier , which is in the ur@@ gent need of the federal government .
the goal is to take the route in December 2020 , says Minister of Foreign Affairs , Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
Nat@@ us sees a sign for regional , but international competing businesses .
the Chamber of commerce and Industry ( I@@ HK ) Trier is involved in the wine of a Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate label to boost sales in Super@@ markets and to stop the trend for the German wine exports for ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to set up their own company , sends the I@@ HK .
in the new Master Bonus , the Handwerk@@ skammer Trier sees an additional incenti@@ ve for young apprentices , says Managing Director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
a premium of 1000 Euro is provided for the Bachelor &apos;s examination and 2,500 euros , when graduates within ten years after their master training .
but the hom@@ e@@ work list for the country stays long .
in the planned road building can be quickly created , at the same time it didn &apos;t agree to the country the necessary staff , says Jan Glock@@ auer , chief executive director of the I@@ HK Trier .
of 56 new engineers who wants to adjust Wis@@ sing at the state operations , only 29 positions were occupied until now .
the I@@ HK calls for more jobs to external offices .
CDU @-@ Fra@@ gran@@ vi@@ ze Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf refers to the calculations of the company , the country invested in 2017 and 2018 in less than 20 million euros less in the receipt of state roads .
in addition , Frank Nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country to remedy the professionals in the region .
seriously , the previous broad@@ band expansion in the country .
in 2016 regional companies had rated the power supply in a I@@ HK survey with a score of 3.4 .
they compl@@ ained about mol@@ dy Internet connections and abor@@ tions .
ex @-@ Economic Minister Ev@@ eline Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and sits still in the Supervisory Board of the wind power company Pro Wind .
the Green Group left Lem@@ on in April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where they had already dre@@ amed the field after four months .
Audi should alter 85@@ 0,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers are faced with a counter @-@ reaction
one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would be able to upgrade the software in more than 35@@ 0,000 vehicles .
the BMW chairman said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company is the opinion that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intelligent options are available as a travel restrictions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and , in order to comply with European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - diesel vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
one of the companies described companies as a recall .
European Automobile Manufac@@ tur@@ ers are promoting the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with requirements for carbon dioxide emissions .
but nitrogen oxi@@ des , which em@@ itted diesel engines , are considered car@@ cin@@ ogenic and may cause as@@ thma .
the costs for the autom@@ akers , to install systems for neutr@@ alisation of diesel vehicles , are also to install that it makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
the German Chancellor Angela Merkel will also be charged to ignore the powerful car companies and signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the error of Volkswagen , which could regul@@ ate the use of so @-@ called auto @-@ devices that were regulated to comply with the regulations when a car has been tested , but to normal driving conditions .
several employees were indicted in the United States , and others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of the Ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics in the engine development of Audi was arrested in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ ch@@ eo Giovanni Pam@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not being protected from extra@@ dition and could be tried in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations into Volkswagen after the authorities have accused us to circum@@ vent the emission regulations in Europe , and a request that focused on the United States has been expanded .
the inclusion of Audi into the study could include Volkswagen heavy buttons : the luxury car manufacturer carries over proportional to the win of Volkswagen .

Mor@@ dil@@ los p@@ oll@@ ard and laugh@@ ter against sorrow
Mor@@ di@@ llo was one of the most widely published carto@@ ons , the dum@@ b of his figures are his trademark .
even with 85 the Argentin@@ ian Argentin@@ ian still works and works on a film .
his message : laugh@@ ter , &quot; because there are too much evil in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immig@@ rants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist , he struck himself among others as a character set for happiness maps - which fru@@ str@@ ated him .
&quot; the lucky day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job . &quot; he said once .
after stations in Lima , New York and Paris , at the end of the &apos; 60s the breakthrough : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in Paris Match , and then also in the &quot; star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
more and again the artists turned inspired by cities .
large , ro@@ di@@ llo figures depic@@ ts himself in drawings with the shooting tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning he s@@ itt@@ eth his own information still at the drawing , works almost ten hours a day .
about cal@@ end@@ ars , puzzles , books for Gross and Klein , T @-@ Shirts , Pl@@ ush favorites and watches will continue to find out much spread over the world .
since six years he has also been working on a cartoon animation and a TV series with its figures .
the main person in the movie &quot; Crazy Island &quot; is a gi@@ raffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los any test@@ ament animal in his drawings - which has a thousands of end@@ ars as counter@@ player .
the figures for the first time speak in the 3D movie that should come to the chin @-@ up of 2019 .
&quot; I don &apos;t know what they will say , it is strange for me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo .
the script is not written by him .
that is why it requires more on the TV series , which is how its original design@@ ations , wor@@ t@@ less is produced .
Lav@@ en@@ del from the Provence of Climate Change
he has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened with climate change .
the lav@@ ender is due to the rec@@ alling conditions and because of the diseases of the insec@@ ts , which are transferred to insec@@ ts , scientists and farmers who try to find solutions that are great head@@ aches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the agricultural research institute CR@@ I@@ EP@@ P@@ AM in Provence , said : &quot; the Lav@@ en@@ del in Provence is effective , because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change , which has brought much less rain over the past years , and in autumn much more .
this has impact on the life of lav@@ ender .
there is also a little z@@ ik@@ ade , a micro @-@ bacteria , the Zwer@@ g@@ zi@@ k@@ ades , and with very dry conditions there are very many of them . &quot;
and it stands far on the game .
lav@@ ender oil sp@@ ans not only for holidays , it is also asked for perf@@ ume and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; rather than enough plants to have a great number of flowers , we have minor , UN@@ TER@@ EN@@ TW@@ IC@@ K@@ EL@@ TE and either missing or weak@@ ened .
thus we have less parts with essential oil . &quot;
among the solutions that are considered to be considered , a better water distribution and the slow@@ down of evap@@ oration from the ground , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mixture of sound and water and the development of varieties that are resistant to dry .

the assassination of a journalist under@@ scores the growing threat in Mexico
the employees of the weekly newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce meet for their plans to review their plans for the most recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by the organized crime , corrupt civil servants and un@@ riv@@ alled drugs .
but on that day , in the shadow of her own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
it was told them that it is important to change their rout@@ ines .
two high @-@ ranking journalists discuss what saf@@ er feels : they will take their children to the office , which were to leave the goal of a attack with gren@@ ades , or they leave home in 2009 .
security experts have written three words at a panel on the front of the room : opponent , neutral , allies .
they ask the repor@@ ter to propose a name for each column - no evidence is necessary , perc@@ ep@@ tions and abdom@@ inal feel .
there are Drug Ad@@ ug@@ gling , politicians , business@@ men , journalists , the suspected of the government or cart@@ els , a catalogue of crimin@@ als , which make the chaos of Mexico .
there is no resting period of violence , and while in the whole country the cor@@ p@@ ses are multiplied . 5@@ 89 have since President En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto on December 2012 . 5@@ 89 stand after attacks and thre@@ ats under federal cover and until now there was at least seven deaths in seven countries .
among the latter , their editors and their inspiration from Ri@@ odo@@ ce , the co @-@ founder Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as , is among the latter .
&quot; the biggest mist@@ akes is to live in Mexico and journalist , &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs .
his lack is felt deep , although its presence is available everywhere - a large photo of Val@@ dez , that portra@@ ys his middle @-@ finger with the word &quot; Justice &quot; on the facade of the ri@@ odo@@ ce building . two repor@@ ters in the 1930 &apos;s , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez , carry T @-@ shirts to show its sm@@ iling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop will take place less than two months after his death and the repor@@ ter discuss their shared issues , the trau@@ ma , its night@@ mar@@ es , ins@@ om@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia .
even though 2010 a special agreement was established in 2010 to edit the cases of journalists , according to the committee for the protection of journalists only two criminal proceedings filed .
as with most thousands of Mor@@ den , which are associated with drug tra@@ ff@@ icking , and organized crimes every year , the mur@@ derer of journalists will only be tried .
with Ri@@ odo@@ ce they still exist to treat the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a while they are un@@ comfor@@ ted and even though the Ter@@ rain is still av@@ ail@@ ible .
without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without righteousness , the meeting for the discussion of security , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very stup@@ id to turn my time in this workshop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says he . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we know not the Lord , do not labour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of 15 May , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the state capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he only managed to drive a couple of blocks before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was forced out by two men . he was forced out of his car and was probably translated into him for 12 times , probably because of the name of the newspaper , which is translated with &quot; 12th river . &quot;
the sc@@ orer went away in his car and damaged it near .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two grown @-@ up children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly into Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an free .
but there are practically nothing in silence on the subject of Val@@ dez .
since Gu@@ z@@ mans &apos;s arrest , last year , and extra@@ dition to the United States in January was Sin@@ alo@@ a to one of the most bloody batt@@ lefield of the country , since riv@@ ing fra@@ ctions come here to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or more people shot on the road or that the cemetery is full of it , two @-@ story m@@ ol@@ een for drug may , which are larger than many houses for the Living .
forget for a minute that there is a state of the &quot; peace &quot; when only one cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable har@@ bours and drugs trading in the United States .
nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the d@@ angers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , was broken down with the gu@@ ilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ understanding contributed to the murder .
first in February , the publication of a interviews with Dam@@ o L@@ op@@ ez , a leader of a riv@@ alled card fra@@ ctions in war with Gu@@ z@@ mans &apos;s sons .
this publication is able to off@@ end the sons , who bought the members bought any copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ k .
the second fault was in it , Val@@ dez no force to force , after the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper , which had published the same story to leave the country for his own safety .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists .
he survived so long that his friends and colleagues would have heard that he would always be there .
he was in 2003 as an experienced repor@@ ter for Nor@@ o@@ este , when he joined Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars to the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism , without having to hit the rob@@ ber@@ y problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the time the newspaper served a reputation because of the cour@@ age@@ ous and hon@@ our@@ able coverage , and its sales and advertising .
repor@@ ter just loved it , hard tre@@ ad investigations , without fear of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship , and the readers were fascin@@ ated by one publication that they could read stories that nobody tend to treat .
eight years after the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Prize &quot; for its coverage in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee on the Protection of Journ@@ alists for his courage in pursu@@ it of the Mexican drug history , where they also led them .
he gave himself up voluntarily to fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to live , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J Award . &quot; &quot; &quot;
drug retailers in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV in October last October .
&quot; you must take over the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play the Dum@@ men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would not want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what did you do before you ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why did you not say what went before ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ri@@ odo@@ ce team is missing Val@@ dez , the fun bird that could curse the boy@@ friend , who was generous with h@@ ugs and Rat@@ chet , a teacher , who knew how to survive .
they trusted for his routine .
he would always bear his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ nab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit on the same table .
now she ask : was his love for routine his destruction ?
his death also has forced them to ask her own ass@@ ump@@ tions about how they can do their work on the best and remain in life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they do not like to deal with their wives , their children , their hus@@ bands , their native start and landing ways &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ sur and self @-@ accounting .
his own inst@@ inc@@ ers trust .
when it sm@@ ells wrong , lead away .
the trouble is , said the editor of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real that &quot; sm@@ elling a sense that can be disappointed ... and then the thing with Javier happens . &quot;
the old rules , such as he and others , are not in Sin@@ alo@@ a no more - just like in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states , in which a toxic mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative dirt , weak institutions and corrupt government officials .
the landscape changes continuously .
in the room where the employees met by Ri@@ odo@@ ce to security training , there were suddenly no mobile phones . days earlier has been known that Spyware , exclusively sold to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside these two polic@@ emen sought protection against the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ story building in a middle class quarter of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in the sh@@ ear , some of the repor@@ ter , whether these officers are among the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen who voted Govern@@ or even as a tru@@ st@@ worthy .
it is months ago , since the repor@@ ter have gone into the mountain landscape , where the drug s@@ ails de fac@@ to stand under control .
for the edition of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce has surrendered to three principal stories .
there was the assassination of the brother of the former box@@ er Juli@@ o Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an Ex@@ pos@@ é to the state expenditure , focused on the hom@@ etown of the governor &apos;s hom@@ etown .
and there was a group that led in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the prosec@@ utor .
there was no official saying about it , who was kidn@@ apped or how it was done , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite local call for drug retailers and authorities .
a repor@@ ter learned from public records that the restaurant has been registered under the name of a polit@@ ician , who ruled the reign of an Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( pr@@ i ) , which ruled almost the whole century all political levels .
recently , several pr@@ i govern@@ ors were accused of corruption of corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the repor@@ ter to write about previous inci@@ dents in this locality , including one in which a son of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man went into a military attack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a few months before the readers wanted to have the column of Val@@ dez as the best informed source of the ab@@ duction .
&quot; previously we knew what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; El FLACO &quot; because of its slim body st@@ ature .
&quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
the office of Val@@ dez was devoted to the storage space for signs and st@@ ic@@ kers that protest against the Mor@@ de of journalists , because workers had never expected to have something unexpected : activists in the name of the press .
repor@@ ter Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez sn@@ app@@ ed a few signs and went next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist for the office of the State Conservatory .
Salvador All@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed in the western state of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body has been discovered and civil servants , based on DNA tests that it is his .
in all the country journalists , journalists became stronger than they organized in organized protests &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; on walking trails and buildings .
on that day the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is gone in Washington and tried to collect international support for the justice in the case of Val@@ dez .
in a meeting with Govern@@ or of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assassination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities to express journalists and destroy them , because they have said the truth .
she has asked since then that it is divided by the government , because it is concerned that their rage has injured their obj@@ ectiv@@ ity .
Val@@ dez was said to be repeated that journalists in Mexico of organiz@@ ational crime , with government officials and an Equ@@ al society . &quot;
in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that repor@@ ter not only be killed by drug people , but also on the command of policies and security forces that were organised by organized crimes under a ceiling .
last year , the media group &quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ulo 19 &quot; accounted for more than half of the attacks on journalists in the police and civil servants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico , you die because you want to keep the mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously the Mor@@ de have a deter@@ rent effect .
no one forget the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
your body was found along with a note that allegedly was signed by the Z@@ etas cart@@ el : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and headphones are beside their left head .
some branches are elected to close as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in northern Uganda state Ch@@ ihu@@ ah@@ ua , after the assassination of Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue to do like El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo according to the assassination of their directors in 2004 .
in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly presented publicly to the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the front page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists fled from their home states or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is difficult to find work in exile , and they still observe roads and are looking for d@@ angers .
and sometimes they are ch@@ ased out , as evi@@ d@@ ently at the photographer Ruben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who continue to stay and continue working , it is a daily dance with risk of risk .
I@@ bar@@ ra who wanted to be a poet , there is that the drug tra@@ ff@@ icking him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico goes to hell , and therefore I became repor@@ ter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last edition was completed , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce were sitting in front of the office and drank beer , when all their phones began to sum@@ ming up .
a series of shooting paintings with band@@ en@@ ri@@ vals and safety signs near the seaside Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war broke out , as promised by a number of cart@@ el messages in the region .
from the cre@@ ep edge of the board they have published the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce on mobile phone .
the front page had to be changed over the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens near to - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the polic@@ emen who held watch , to see if they were in will@@ ing@@ ness .
if they had fear all , they didn &apos;t show it .
under the enormous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle @-@ finger was visible for all Sin@@ alo@@ a , the employees of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his traces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you remember to remember , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the same day was murdered at Javier , the intern asked me to send them to the road . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ouflage to go out his enemies
at first glance it looks like a statue , even though a terri@@ fying .
now researchers found that the first findings of the incredible r@@ hin@@ ts of a Canadian min@@ ers have been so good that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa the Din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so good that they could even determine that his ch@@ uck &apos;s skin was of red@@ dish Braun - and they said that she had had something of a &quot; un@@ quiet past . &quot;
the report in the &quot; Current Biology &quot; journal called it as &quot; the dying @-@ kept din@@ osau@@ rs , who ever was found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs copies of the world . &quot;
fossil is a newly discovered type of no@@ dos@@ au@@ rier which lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ace@@ ous period from 110 million to 112 million years ago .
his incredible good preserved condition , researchers , who really describe it as &quot; really remarkable &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the paved plant was the best preserved F@@ ossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn funk when he was on 21 March 2011 in Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine at Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b .
he met something , what seemed to be more precise by the surrounding rock .
the fossil @-@ fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pale@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to un@@ cover the wild beast within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) .
after all this hard work , the pre @-@ finished result is ready to be unveiled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you think only a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that it was sleeping , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum where the creature seems to see . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is considered one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs of din@@ osau@@ rs - the Mon@@ a Lisa the Din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
researchers have found that this plant her@@ ni@@ vo@@ res , although it is covered with a arm@@ or , probably resem@@ bles a wall @-@ changing tank , probably by the car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs .
the strongly sealed din@@ osau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ouflage to hide themselves before smo@@ kers , and used a sh@@ iel@@ ding technology that is used as counter@@ f@@ att@@ ing , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have been allowed to avoid better in its surroundings and to expand his enemies , experts , what indicates that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million years old creature from the family of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier , made head@@ lines for the first time in May , is now visible at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild beast and named Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli at the Muse@@ um@@ st@@ echni@@ ker Mark Mitchell , one of a team that spent more than 7.000 hours to cover it carefully .
the amazing conservation of the specimen made it possible Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the samples and form of sheds and arm@@ or in his body .
they discovered the con@@ forming , a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom , meaning that the tip of the creature was dar@@ ker than its under@@ side .
although the const@@ ants are common , the results are surprising because the size of Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta exceeds the living animals today .
it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ rs of din@@ osau@@ rs was ch@@ ased out of plenty of pressure through the n@@ ress@@ ful din@@ osau@@ rs , that evolution the con@@ front@@ ation of the con@@ front@@ ation as means of survival .
but most contemporary animals , which are using the const@@ ants - think of to@@ e , zeb@@ ra , or belt @-@ animals - are much smaller and infr@@ in@@ ous than spo@@ ils , what sign@@ alizes that this no@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real fight .
&quot; strong &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong cra@@ wler @-@ behavior on a massive , strongly covered din@@ osau@@ rs show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs cra@@ b animals have to have been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic connections in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ rs was red @-@ brown .
scientists continue to examine the animal of his life , including his con@@ ser@@ ene per@@ min@@ ent to figure out what it has eaten as its last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs , when he died , was pushed into a river and driven into the sea , where he sank on the sea back .
at that time Alberta was so warm like southern fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably spread much more widespread than they are today .
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved skin , but also in three dimensions retained , and keeping the original form of the animal . &quot; he said Brown .
&quot; the result is that the animal looks like today like in the early C@@ ret@@ ace@@ ous period .
you don &apos;t need to use fantasy to re@@ construct it . if you only need a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that he is in sleep . &quot;
the chal@@ k time was time when huge thermal di@@ odes , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , which stood on two legs , pulled through the earth .
although the king of them , the Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , millions years after Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the paved din@@ osau@@ rs was ch@@ ased out of some of his fur@@ tive ancestors .
it belongs to the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 11,5 m ) long , six tons heavy monsters .
the scientists , whose latest findings appear in the Current Biology magazine , believe that Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta has been post@@ ulated after death in the sea and has been m@@ um@@ bled in the mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn funk when he was on 21 March 2011 in Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine at Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b .
according to the museum , it is covered by the covered din@@ osau@@ rs of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from mu@@ zzle to th@@ igh .
the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3.000 pounds ( 1,300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips that ra@@ ged from his shoul@@ ders .
the researchers believe that the paved plant was floo@@ ded by the western Canada by a floo@@ ded river up to a floo@@ ded river .
but the under@@ lining of the din@@ osau@@ rs are preserved his arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the rem@@ n@@ ants of this special specimen are so well preserved , that the skin remains still hol@@ den still @-@ pri@@ ved tank panels along the din@@ osau@@ rs .
as Michael Gre@@ sh@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a result of the conservation as &apos; rarely as a profit in lot@@ tery .
the more I see it , the more conf@@ using .
still remains the skin of the skin , still the woo@@ dy steel plates still wear the skull of the animal .
his right front is on its side , its five fingers are spread upwards .
I can count the sheds on his sole . &quot;
in the thunder@@ storm : mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ ting on the A8 : many wounded
strong accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : almost 30 vehicles were involved in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
there are numerous injured , leng@@ thy @-@ long pieces - and g@@ aff@@ er .
on the highway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A8 ) , some 20 people have been injured at the end of th@@ ag@@ round morning at a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
according to the initial information of the police , at 17.00 hours between the inter@@ connecting no@@ zh@@ ausen and O@@ del@@ zh@@ ausen ( County A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) , during a thunder@@ storm , nearly 30 vehicles , among them probably also lor@@ ries , in@@ clin@@ ched .
about the exact number of publ@@ ishers initially no data before .
it took slight to moderate injuries , one of the pol@@ ze@@ al pre@@ aches .
a big prohibition on rescue vehicles was at the accident .
the A8 was closed down in the direction of Munich .
in the direction of Munich , some ten kilometres long returned .
like a AZ repor@@ ter , it also came on counter @-@ track to massive disabilities - by numerous members .
the fire brig@@ ade took the characteristics of the vehicle hand@@ leb@@ ars who now have to calculate with sensitive tigh@@ tening .
shortly after 18 : 45 , another accident happened on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
it was a coll@@ ision among a car racing and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident .
German railway : Group tested &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment to have experienced almost everyone at once : nothing definitely sits in the train and sleeps .
or it is deep@@ ened in his work and has just a brilliant idea .
and then : buff@@ ers .
comes to Schaff@@ ner and wake up an uns@@ ure or strike the driving right in the midst of the workflow .
ticket control .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn are currently testing vehicle security control .
it is simply re @-@ approved by phone that one is taken and evalu@@ ates the driver card .
currently , a test mode runs on two routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what we offer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is expected to be available in Germany from the beginning of next year , on many other correspondence lines in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a train spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot; calls the train to the ticket system without Schaff@@ ner .
however , in order to be able to use , however , some requirements must be met : one requires a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to booked an online ticket - what are you already able to do for most passengers .
you must also have purchased via the App Center , the DB Navigator , which is why the most comfortable type of ticket booking is needed .
and last one needs a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; functions : one gets to the train , calls his ticket to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a button for the electronic recognition is then released with the reviews .
the train atten@@ ds get on their mobile devices a message that driving g@@ ast X is located in the train and the booked seat system Y has taken .
comes the train manager at the ticket number Y knows that a passenger is already sitting there with already ent@@ ail online ticket .
so one can continue to continue , continue , keep silent .
the &quot; check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customers , one for the railway - which again should use the passengers .
&quot; who wants to travel without ticket control through our train staff , checked in the DB Navigator .
this enables the passengers to create their travel time in the train , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing Management Board by DB Fern@@ transport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to enter the individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who often travels , knows that in addition to del@@ ays and missed the ticket fare , belong to the largest off@@ ences .
for often , in any case one of the travelling time does not need all the documents that are needed for the recovery of online tickets .
either the credit card or identity card or otherwise a document that must be present .
the result are endless discussions between mig@@ rating and drivers , which leads to worse mood in the section or large and del@@ ays at the control of your own tickets and the Schaff@@ ner at the end of the time takes care of taking care of others .
even a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and also only on the ICE 915 Dortmund University Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further access numbers on the same distance are not un@@ locked .
how a activists came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
Britt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was sh@@ aken at the core on 9 August 2014 .
just one day after she arrived in New York City , sitting in St. Louis , sitting on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment , which they rented and sc@@ roll@@ out through Facebook on their phone .
you are proud of a post by som@@ eb@@ ody from High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed a 18 year old child and still on the road &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she was called there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
conf@@ used , since no one had posted the information on their feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Ph@@ aro@@ ah was continually prayed in their tim@@ eline .
the Rap@@ per from the territory of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white police officers in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , to be killed live .
he posted a picture of Brow@@ ns le@@ bl@@ os@@ em body , stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours .
&quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; I thought Fer@@ rel@@ l . &quot;
but death was not new for them and their community .
you put your mobile phone later in order to return to twe@@ ets on the Can@@ field @-@ Drive later in the evening .
there were photos of police tape and people , crying , and of a man who claimed to be Brow@@ ns Father who had a shield with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ ons Police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she observed a live feed when a polic@@ eman stood before a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bell@@ ine dog .
in another video , she said , secured another polic@@ eman and cried out , &quot; I will all kill you ... &quot; animals all kill . &quot;
&quot; that is not common , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l remin@@ ded her statement .
&quot; that is not the kind of murder that we are reconc@@ iled to us and we are able to name it . &quot;
at this moment I felt den@@ sely frost .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
you booked a return flight and went home next day .
after landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she secured their 6 year old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on next morning .
what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the topic of a new documentary movie , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the cinem@@ as from the 11 .
it is a history of survival and loss , the strength and loss of resistance , which consists of the perspective of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers .
when Fer@@ rel@@ l went with her daughter , which brought a flower dress and a matching crown after F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two one conversation , which they had countless times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black condition . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thou remin@@ ded you , as I taught you when black people must fight for it , what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we now go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police had killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy , and that was not right .
I could not bring her away , &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l .
&quot; what happens today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
you must know it and get it .
it must be well developed , not only acti@@ vis@@ m and organization but also know the various layers of the black experience and the black Constitution and what we must do to free to free ourselves .
even if I have lucky enough to give you a experience , in which she personally experienced no ec@@ lat@@ ant rac@@ ism , it is not different than the next black women child .
I have the feeling I would give you a bad service to keep them away . &quot;
the first stop when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a location opposite the Police Authority , which became a camp@@ ground as the activists on the possible non @-@ indictment by Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there , Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter have joined together with a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared bags and helped to pass away to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly began to take a new type of acti@@ vis@@ m for fer@@ rel@@ l shape .
&quot; my acti@@ vis@@ m has changed after August 9th , totally changed , &quot; said she and not@@ ices that she was a student at the University of Missouri . St. Louis president of the Min@@ ority Student N@@ urse Association and focused on Ess@@ ential justice and health ine@@ qualities in black congregations .
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it has come all . &quot;
weeks later , Fer@@ rel@@ l met at Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an evening , a co @-@ director of the film .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cin@@ emat@@ ograph@@ er Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted to be only &quot; documented &quot; what happened .
a question came Fer@@ rel@@ l in the sense : &quot; you want to document or try to find a story that you can explo@@ it ? &quot;
this Sk@@ ep@@ tic@@ sis was nour@@ ished through countless cases of people , often by White - in a community that benef@@ ited from their pain and its resistance .
as follows recently in an interview : &quot; we had heard that people who were born in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on and grew up , their voices were not cent@@ red , and we wanted to make it different . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already been working with the then Co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area , who is known for his acti@@ vis@@ m rum around the death of death .
his commitment brought the project closer together with six other native loc@@ als , together with six other native loc@@ als , followed by &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ns &apos;s shot .
&quot; this documentary isn &apos;t someone who speaks to us or talk with us . we speak , &quot; said Davis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was the main thing for me as these people will be displayed , because I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to focus on Fer@@ re@@ ll@@ s experience - to show that there is not a Messiah leaders , but to participate in a community , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the most obvious participant of the film .
therefore , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; sur@@ pris@@ ingly personal aspects of Fer@@ re@@ ll@@ s life , as she loves himself and mar@@ ries her wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l and laugh@@ ed when they saw the ready product for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that there must be certain danger during this work and in the human being of the black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Fer@@ re@@ ll@@ s &apos;s history is repe@@ ating the role of the black pregnant women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves movement .
two of the three founder of the movement , who led the film &quot; Black@@ liv@@ es@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in the social media in 2012 , identi@@ fies the film &quot; Black@@ liv@@ es@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media .
&quot; black , Sw@@ ab@@ ule women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether , &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , &quot; and therefore we are strug@@ gling with different fron@@ ts .
black , pregnant women have to wear the main load of all . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an voted to note that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement really is maintained by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it insi@@ sted that &quot; this is not a &quot; m@@ ative type of action &quot; when Fer@@ rel@@ l was selected as the heart of the film by Fer@@ rel@@ l .
&quot; she was the person who pushed these energy , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s no co@@ incidence , although it was at the fore@@ front front because there was a black , pregnant woman as much in the game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can feel your energy by screen . &quot;
meanwhile , the t@@ elecommunications line in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on has long gone , but remains the r@@ ass@@ al connections between the church and the police remains .
Fer@@ rel@@ l is on prob@@ ation for 2 ½ years due to the blocking of a highway at a demonstration .
she describes the social atmosphere of the area , which she calls her home : &quot; a chaos . &quot;
nevertheless she turns to a singing and she feels wonderful to this memory , since they went on road three years ago in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we must love one another and support .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; size network &quot; : TV @-@ reader discuss bits in bit
the bit Gallery moved the people , although they are not yet built long .
but the idea of a shopping centre on the southern end of the pedestrian zone has been ob@@ sol@@ ete since the first presentation in 2009 , the population in advoc@@ ate and opponents .
the topic is hardly a cold .
the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; on our Facebook page .
during one bit of the bit Gallery : &quot; it would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; This would be real @-@ class &quot; ( Nicole Gra@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; does not need a man &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ NR ) or quite simple : &quot; size w@@ inter@@ ing ! &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) .
while the advoc@@ ate insi@@ sted that a gallery attrac@@ ts more customers to the city , of which the other business also benefit , the ad@@ versaries will fear that then the pedestrian zone is fur@@ ther@@ ed .
in addition , the gallery is planned on the property , on which the pe@@ asant market hall stands , where 13 guides will offer their products .
it will end with the start of construction .
the gallery M@@ acher want to integrate a market hall in the new building - as a Bed@@ a Square , with possibility of sitting outside .
Simone : &quot; we &apos;ve been selling almost weekly in the pe@@ asant market for many years .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cake of the vir@@ gins are always very happy .
we also have discovered the but@@ cher for us .
we would wish that during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
there are also other cities in other cities .
especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct mark@@ eted in a market hall in the gallery , comes to the amount of rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new project is probably not just low . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva Kil@@ ic : &quot; what is the shopping mall in Bit@@ burg ?
whether Clo@@ thing , shoes , dr@@ ills or supermarkets : I find the super@@ flu@@ ous .
of which there are enough in our city .
you can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .
but there is not even a regular weekly market still , it is so important that at least the market hall remains .
for after all , the goods offered there is fresh , mainly by the supplier , and is pure cheap .
as you can see , shop @-@ shops in a shopping centre can only be rented from bigger firms , because they are often not portable for a single retail@@ er .
a pity , special shops are almost no longer and what remains of it , then probably van@@ ish . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &apos; a shopping mall with a market hall does not fit for me .
and the gallery doesn &apos;t work to Bit@@ burg .
above all : where is the pe@@ asant market hall during the construction time ?
the old E@@ DE@@ KA would be the solution - even on duration when the bit of the bit actually comes down .
or creates the bit @-@ bit Gallery before , to drive all shops from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; that &apos;s not easy to work .
and shopping center , which is empty , no one needs .
because of my view it would have been better to promote a real pe@@ asant market instead of this gallery .
but for a pe@@ asant market hall , thanks to the mad many - how I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in Bit@@ burg no more space .

in the middle of the room of Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces are visible - white , black and brown , which are almost un@@ readable - which hang on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ ur and Haar@@ lem , which were sent from Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent out the ex@@ cer@@ pts from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where former secret service analy@@ tics found a 35 @-@ year @-@ old prison after she made diplomatic noti@@ fications about the Wik@@ i website .
the new exhibition , which was opened on 2 August , is a Bec@@ oming Res@@ em@@ bl@@ ance ( a matching simil@@ arity ) .
it is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipl@@ ines have been transformed into its expertise in technology , computer science and art , and man@@ ing , whose convic@@ tion was converted to Barack Obama only three days in his ministry .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has created through the algorithm analysis of the DNA which could look like any intellectual comment on how to interpre@@ t these gen@@ om@@ ic data - the many wise men how they can interpre@@ t and created the inher@@ ent Det@@ er@@ min@@ ism of these interpre@@ tations - but also for identity .
Mann@@ ing , which was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , has already been talking about the identification as a woman , was sentenced in 2013 for 20 charges , including six cl@@ ashes against the Sp@@ ion@@ age@@ Act , computer was and theft .
by the prison , its picture was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo taken - a gra@@ ined , black @-@ white Sel@@ f@@ ie , in the man@@ ing near a driver &apos;s seat and carries a plat@@ el@@ bl@@ onde perme@@ ability - with which it was associated .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg returned from the great success of their 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions &apos; .
it produced the artist portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts , like cigarette dum@@ b and chew@@ ing g@@ um , using the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of what people might look like .
that was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they led an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing , while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; declared De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press preview of the new exhibition .
and she could not visit this time and could not be photograph@@ ed , therefore , they took contact with Chelsea and asked them whether they wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her in@@ car@@ cer@@ ated M@@ use were forced to un@@ ob@@ s@@ ate bricks which had f@@ ished several letters over the course of two years .
they even illustr@@ ate one of Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o illustrated com@@ ic &quot; Supp@@ lied images , &quot; which would be a future fore@@ seen , in which the president el@@ bows would convert and would be able to see the exhibition personally .
that Obama actually was actually a few days after the book was published , man@@ ings release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas , was a welcome way of lucky event .
there is also now at the opening of the exhibition some depth and Star@@ kes , since Donald Tr@@ ump leads a war against in@@ forman@@ t from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ able paths to fix the rigid bo@@ ilers , which it should actually fix .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked after the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen from a certain reason . &quot;
in one on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing called for her over@@ sized signature among them ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name is equipped with a heart ) an end of &quot; automatic collapse , their foundation sex , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall is its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thousands of Cs and Gs and As described in a pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg trusted , through the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nu@@ cle@@ ot@@ ide after the highly developed scientific Lex@@ icon of the artist ) , as amazing similar , at least in biological regard , we all are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what people are hop@@ efully will take care of us , who we are , and how openly genetic data for a interpretation and how sub@@ jective they are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works from 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous memories , too can be seen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; DNA dates can tell so many different stories , therefore the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room , is one side from the above mentioned com@@ ic @-@ nov@@ elle .
she shows Mann@@ ing , as it comes with a hands @-@ free spins in the hand of the discipl@@ ines of the United States as King Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they ch@@ ill your words , then they won . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; so just never get the mouth . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter which she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist , who gre@@ et from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I still get ge@@ ese when I speak about it . &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not yet seen the exhibition nor seen in the com@@ ic book - but when it was expected to do it , then it will be greeted in the middle of the room of m@@ asks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic simulation , which are summarized as hor@@ des of Protest@@ ants .
that was also targeted , as all in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ings St@@ ature ) , where their genetic h@@ ap@@ se groups were written with pencil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , I had them on the wall but I wanted to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted to feel like a mass movement that feels like a mass movement that formed themselves with Chelsea , like the movement that was behind their liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of the University of North@@ western and a Indi@@ cator of the University of Oxford for killing
a nationwide human hunting is a professor at North@@ western University and a staff of the University of Oxford which had been sought to susp@@ ects a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with dead@@ ly injuries .
on Monday this Monday were issued for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham L@@ ath@@ em ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ ts due to its alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as the acts of the District Court of Cook County .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several bul@@ lets .
a memor@@ able warning system was published by the Chicago Department of Police in Chicago , which was discovered on 27 July .
civil servants received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the sacrifice with several injuries in his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared on the site of the existence for dead , and Det@@ ectives investigate the stit@@ ches as murder while police are actively looking for the two susp@@ ects , officials said .
L@@ ath@@ em has been Professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at North@@ western University since 2007 .
Alan K. Cub@@ gar@@ bage , the vice @-@ president for university relationships , said in an e @-@ mail statement that L@@ ath@@ em has now been lau@@ ched and excluded from the bed of the North@@ western University campus in North@@ western University .
&quot; this is now a criminal matter which is examined by the competent authorities , and the North@@ western University co@@ operated on this examination , &quot; said Cub@@ an .
War@@ ren is senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford .
a spokes@@ person at the University and Som@@ erville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; we are in contact with the police in contact and ready to help us to help us the US investig@@ ative authorities . &quot;
the statement said that War@@ r@@ ens colleagues were sho@@ cked and want to make sure that he turned himself .
chief Communications Officer of Chicago , Anthony Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi , said that he demanded the susp@@ ects the susp@@ ects of the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have a presentation of her position , and our efforts to loc@@ alize them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects .
Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said that police received a call from the building administrator of the Grand @-@ Plaza building that has just received a representative tip that has just happened to an apartment 1008 .
the police described the scene than very horri@@ ble .
Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said it is un@@ clear whether the incident occurred on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security cameras that L@@ ath@@ em and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victims had a relationship , &quot; Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said .
the management team of Grand Plaza published a statement on the residents : &quot; the police currently works on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and resear@@ ches a variety of moti@@ ves , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; we will conclu@@ de the WA@@ DA ti@@ met@@ able in the near future &quot; - Russian Vi@@ zep@@ re@@ mi@@ er Mut@@ ko
the Russian Vi@@ zep@@ re@@ mi@@ er Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said it will not last long until the remaining criteria of the world @-@ anti @-@ d@@ oping agency ( WA@@ DA ) are implemented for restoration of the Russian Anti @-@ d@@ oping Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; in a certain stage of ful@@ filling the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test their cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK anti @-@ d@@ oping ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the WA@@ DA ti@@ met@@ able has been updated in this regard , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of the sched@@ ules of the WA@@ DA to comply with the code that describes the criteria for re@@ integration of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the website of the organization .
according to Mut@@ ko he doesn &apos;t contain anything that could claim a concern for Russia .
&quot; all has been announced , everything is implemented .
and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; he added .
one of the criteria mentioned in the list indicates that Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping authorities adopted the reported results of the WA@@ DA approved by Canadian attor@@ ney Richard McLaren to accept nation@@ ally supported d@@ op@@ ings in the Russian sport .
in relation to the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; we lead the investigation because our anti @-@ d@@ oping system got a mistake .
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no state programmes , and we will not give something that is not exists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mut@@ ually words agreed with those of Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v , the leader of the independent Russian Anti @-@ d@@ oping Commission .
in conversation with Russian sales place R@@ Sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v had problems the past in Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping organizations , then added : &quot; we have repeated that the report disp@@ uted positions and regulations .
no one has added to accept this report , &quot; Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v added .
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded from the implementation of D@@ oping control in Russia in November 2015 .
however , you was allowed to plan and coordin@@ ate tests under the supervision of international experts and UK anti @-@ d@@ oping ( U@@ K@@ AD ) .
after a visit to the main quarters of the Organisation in Moscow , WA@@ DA @-@ Director General Olivier Nig@@ gli stated that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moves to the right direction &quot; in order to be re @-@ employed .
Al@@ di sell at first no eggs more
they distributed the company groups .
it is a pure pre @-@ reference , it could not be assumed in any health impair@@ ment , it was stated in the notification .
from now on , only eggs are supplied to Al@@ di , which have been veri@@ fi@@ ably tested negative for fi@@ ref@@ il@@ hal@@ e anti @-@ po@@ orer .
al@@ di add clarity and transparency to his clients .
the start @-@ ups that will help your company will not become the next U@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure luck in your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the surveys did not work .
answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful , or - even worse - fr@@ au@@ dul@@ ent .
and even if you promised an@@ onym@@ ity , some workers do not mourn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was just never consistency and obj@@ ectiv@@ ity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who operates the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ commerce Hair Care Company Madison Re@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are called people from the outside .
a new breed of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is at Wach@@ sen to help companies to find out how their employees feel .
through the creation and licens@@ ing of software that has the specific purpose of the employee engagement , it allows companies to conduct surveys , special groups and demo@@ graphic groups , and in some cases of W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ n allow C @-@ suite exec@@ u@@ tives and turn directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; they now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for the persecution of their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analy@@ tics tool is used to measure employees .
Er@@ ret@@ t said that they have a better insight into what your collabor@@ ators think and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t .
in addition to the Sn@@ ap @-@ surveys and poll@@ s of certain teams , it offers a heat card of the company that shows most complaints , and which managers have low state results - so that you can ref@@ res@@ h why .
the company intends to see that at the top of the work@@ station culture , so that you will not be the next U@@ ber , who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als , since then a former employee has published a blog post , which deals with an environment of har@@ ass@@ ments , in those who have spoken it punished .
for the start @-@ ups like G@@ lin@@ t , this wish is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business possibility after an overview .
the Global Corporate Governance , Regulation and Compliance @-@ sector could possess more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion by 2020 , after the financial technical site let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments .
Denver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps prevent unauthorized access and to detect , saw a rising interest and activity in the beginning of this year in the midst of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles .
Conver@@ cent has almost 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tesla .
u@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
as G@@ lin@@ t , Conver@@ cent company makes customized &quot; pulse &quot; converting , confi@@ dential answers to real time and enjoy the warmth card of your problem areas .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hotline which can report the employee in bad ways .
and when the main managing director is involved , complaints directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court of public opinion has been identified the fans &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , founder and managing director of Conver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a company found that his staff is po@@ or@@ ally treated or in@@ eth@@ ical , it can experience co@@ stly consequences by consumers @-@ boy@@ cott , employees of workers and complaints , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant @-@ chain with more than 25.000 employees and over 500 locations , Conver@@ cent has been used for over one year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures , and have a simple opportunity to reach their corporate headquarters .
before , when a cler@@ k wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or email for the company headquarters , a formal complaint and hope that he was serious .
it was often a roll@@ out and un@@ comfortable experience , James Vit@@ rano , Ruby TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ Y@@ S General Coun@@ sel , who said , there was no good way to track the complaints of employees .
now , since the company convertible securities , problems , previously being hidden by exec@@ u@@ tives that were in offices in cities or countries , were identified - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or in@@ lay practitioners faster and an@@ ew .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can be closer to this holi@@ stic , 360 @-@ degree view over the experience of employment &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who runs the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment law . &quot;
companies began to take eth@@ ics , values and employees in 2002 after accounting company Arthur Ander@@ sen , because of the accounting company Arthur Ander@@ sen , because of the En@@ ron sc@@ and@@ al , Qu@@ in@@ lan told .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; Social Media &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came out &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that the company knew that you could not prevent their dirty clothes online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; prior to the use of technology for the monitoring of eth@@ ics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both G@@ lin@@ t as well as Conver@@ cent offer your software as service , and ma@@ sts the businesses with recur@@ ring fees for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance that takes the approval of Venture Capital Invest@@ ors who have both start @-@ ups .
Conver@@ cent received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sapphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , where the whole capital was raised to $ 47 million .
gl@@ itz secured $ 10 million in November by Bess@@ emer Venture Partners and brought his entire funding to $ 60 million .
this investments will hardly be sur@@ pris@@ ingly , in view of the connected nature of companies , culture and Venture Capital .
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more than before .
in competitive markets such as Sil@@ icon Valley are high sal@@ aries and interesting projects only .
the employees want to have the feeling that you will be accepted and appreciated that you will give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if people are happy to be able to feel in one company , and that the work which you will do to make sure that the company will succeed him &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Per@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which uses both Conver@@ cent and g@@ lin@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
investors reach R@@ end@@ om , when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well , if employees are working and engaged .
if the Analytics tools are third , commitment and use of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data on the employee commitment to the experts of the workplace culture is important .
but data are us@@ eless if the company had no measures to take action .
in fact , when a company asks employees according to your feedback , there is a expect@@ ation that change is on its way .
and if the change doesn &apos;t come fast enough , or not at all , this dis@@ appoint@@ ments can be dis@@ appoint@@ ments and employees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you ask 4.000 suggestions , you must be ready to have 4,000 discussions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at Business Management Company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen the company to rely on collecting data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if not all of you will not follow , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
will you take care of this ?
and who do not worry about it , why should I ? &quot;
Madison Re@@ ed , who now has monthly employees , was able to initi@@ ate measures on the same day if a problem is reported about G@@ lin@@ t , thus ret@@ t .
and after collecting the feedback of fru@@ str@@ ated employees , it was able to organize the speed of decision and quality of communication , to organize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to tackle the problems .
with Ruby Tuesday the company will always receive new in@@ sights into the staff , and it hopes for a long point of view , this leads to a better binding of workers in a sector , known for high sales .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose men , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you lose men , you will also lose the customer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if you lose customers , then you will lose your company .
the N@@ CAA elim@@ in@@ ates two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for Bru@@ ins
it starts at 23 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ CL@@ A footprint on one side of the new practice fields of the team will keep on campus .
some of their tri@@ k@@ ot@@ ers moved out and show the back complete of silence from the first day of the workout .
for a good part of the team , these un@@ usually takes a lunch break .
players who are invited to the Summer Courses will return to their aud@@ itors , before they return on the next morning at 6 : 30 a.m. to the water man Football Center .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is for the guys the next three days a real T@@ ret@@ Mill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before the Monday became Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CAA elim@@ in@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of the player and she has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three training of the U@@ CL@@ A should begin at 19 : 15 to meet the players already packed .
the compromise between the two days is more than one day when the Bru@@ ins moved to the beginning of camps almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six days in West@@ wood practical exercises .
they are supposed to hold 18 exercises in the course of August . 20 before beginning of formal toys for their pre@@ lu@@ de against Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he will support the control change of the N@@ CAA itself , even if they are to add another point of routes to the player .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this tremendous burden for three or four days , and it &apos;s very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they simply pressed them , they pl@@ ets down , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think once we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will really be great . &quot;
the U@@ CL@@ A will finish its practices as soon as the camp has ended its panels from an adjacent parking and the ad@@ joining Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the up@@ scale class that has already been covered with floor cover@@ ings , which will have a protected network behind a goal .
Bru@@ ins players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a dre@@ amed a problem that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; we will use our safety , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it &apos;s not far back to think that people can rent a room there , and then set there to draw a practice there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the video on your exercise , it is a pretty good business .
but we have security forces there and we have security forces on parking lot 8 .
we will do the best thing we have .
I &apos;m not doing too much for me .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts in combat against counter@@ f@@ ake messages
Facebook wants to send more potential items with Fal@@ sch@@ messages to fact vali@@ dated third parties and their results in the original subscription , said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight f@@ ake news .
the company said in an opinion on his site that it will start with the use of revised mechanical learning methods to identify possible fal@@ seh@@ ood , and to send them to the fact that may show results of the fact check of the original article .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the principal points for so @-@ called F@@ ake news , of which many believed that they also affected the U.S. presidential elections in 2016 .
the problem is also become a major political theme in Europe , whereby the French elec@@ tor have been floo@@ ded with false stories in May , and Germany should not succeed , after the social media networks will not succeed , h@@ iller filled post@@ ings as before the elections there in September quickly .
on Thursday , Facebook spoke in a separate statement on German that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany has started a test of the new facts .
&quot; in addition to the knowledge that stories of fac@@ tions over@@ review third parties , people want to make more context to make sure what they read and share , &quot; said Sara Su , Product Manager for Facebook news in a blog .
she added that Facebook continues to feature his feature &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; related Articles &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and related to other changes in his news feed to reduce incorrect messages . &quot; &quot; &quot;
creating a Com@@ ic novel : a Castle in the history of England
in his younger past , the small Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squ@@ e@@ eze @-@ music video and was a hat@@ ch for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ he and 1980 @-@ s .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of tur@@ bul@@ ent history of his cozy sitting in the valley of K@@ ent and now is now for inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a mop@@ ha@@ ari@@ i Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man , with a great love for historical documents .
&quot; I find it so nice to look at the manuscript of som@@ eb@@ ody who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he says so tired .
&quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England plays the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documented the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . each history was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Lenk@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des , which is based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents in British Library - a project that he was unexpected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only re@@ acts on the thum@@ b print on the side of a letter that was written by a double agents in the 1700 &apos;s , who worked for the Jac@@ o@@ bin@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is his Dau@@ men@@ ab@@ druck !
and his letters smell as smoke , because then fire was kindled a fire because of light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has a effect as he himself would also be .
Oh , I love Archive ! &quot;
for someone who struck so with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England , and almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be hon@@ est : I have been a little over &quot; ) &quot; it seems to be all too beautiful to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days to explore the Vict@@ orian &quot; new &quot; Castle , to study the archives on the many treasures and cur@@ ios@@ ities of the castle , like the mon@@ stro@@ kes Hy@@ g@@ heads in walls and bottles that had spent centuries in the tr@@ ench .
he walked through the complex and ruins of the old castle and spoke with rural conservation , gar@@ dener and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
then , at night he drank &quot; Whis@@ key and began to write . &quot;
the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust received the full access in 2006 , when the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rho@@ des arrived one decade later , the employees began to take care of the archive which he spoke than &quot; hundreds of years in which Arist@@ ot@@ ees said &quot; Oh , ra@@ p it on the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the time of the English Em@@ pi@@ res , maps , depic@@ ting what had said : &quot; you could mean that land contra@@ ction would be bo@@ red , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to have fought two families .
guys , let &apos;s go all his ais@@ le ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to reach a wider basis in the English history , among them &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which leaves the newly built castle in order to join the pe@@ asant uprising of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of an u@@ pro@@ ar that occurred in 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book with the title &apos; Kn@@ igh@@ tly Famil@@ ies of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; Rho@@ des .
&quot; the farm arose in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start .
perhaps the two connected together ? &quot;
other stories are firmly ro@@ oted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the history of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ rons , hidden the family Dar@@ rel@@ l for seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The Sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers &apos; in which the Sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l produced from the 18th century , who filled his own fun@@ er@@ als by winning a sar@@ g with stones ( a discovery that was excav@@ ated only years later than its Sar@@ g was excav@@ ated ) .
the Dar@@ re@@ ll@@ s are Rho@@ des &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the Lor@@ ds of Shi@@ pped G@@ aun@@ ts to be back and spending money for things they could not aff@@ ord themselves .
other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l men sol@@ ves their debt crisis by giving the rich women of marriage - I present them as a he@@ ap well @-@ looking boys , with a talent , to promote land@@ locked . &quot;
after the end of his deployment in the castle Rho@@ des on the search for other unique write experiences
he has brought a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a com@@ ic novel about El@@ se@@ än@@ m@@ ä@@ ki , the site of a san@@ atorium dating back to the early 20th century , which has since been requested by nature again .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go again , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to be finished with the dam@@ ned life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign started : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ elle is covered in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the unveil@@ ing of the 301 @-@ year old Mari@@ enk@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f has started its campaign for introducing a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau on Thursday ) .
then until Thursday , Mayor Otto N@@ EU@@ HO@@ FF and his marketing team want to hold the logo and slogan home at Nelson Art@@ z .
at the end of August it is supposed to be the highlight of the campaign to be a feast on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; to be beautiful for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ask the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ acher of Aktion since yesterday on the posters at the rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we think this ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; write them on their yesterday website .
&quot; but we use this measure to win your attention .
and to make it clear that it &apos;s better than it seems .
basically , we are the firm convic@@ tion that we know as Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer to know the beauty and attrac@@ tiv@@ eness of our city . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the promotion there is more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s true to form@@ ulate a stand@@ alone promise that gives the town a distinctive feature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
eventually they stand in the competition with other municipalities .
the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f can spend their new umbrella brand and the campaign in the middle sized five @-@ digit amount .
military re@@ forms in Turkey - Ge@@ og@@ ans fear of the army
each year at the beginning of August , in Ankara , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) on pension funds and convey@@ ors were in army officers .
this is the same week .
at first glance a normal operation .
but nothing is a routine in the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup attempt .
the session took place no more in the building of the general Staff , as before , but at the Office of the Prime Minister .
the advis@@ ors took part in the advis@@ ors by the presi@@ dency of the state as well as the Minister for Defence , Interior , Justice and Foreign Office .
thus the civilians were killed in Y@@ as in the Over@@ number .
the government attrac@@ ts the bre@@ wing in the military .
Staff of Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office but the Commander of the He@@ eres , the Air Force , and the Marine were removed .
since the failed coup , Staat@@ liche Erd@@ og@@ an 169 of 326 gener@@ als and ad@@ mir@@ als were fired .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the army &apos;s ranks - mostly because of alleged connections for the movement of exile @-@ pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , Erd@@ og@@ an as a wire drawing of the coup .
for 486 people , which should have been involved in the coup attempt , will be negoti@@ ated in Ankara since this week .
already on the day after the coup , Erd@@ og@@ an had called the overthrow of &quot; God &apos;s gift , &quot; as he had given him the opportunity to de@@ file the armed forces . &quot;
but has Erd@@ og@@ an really found the army in the handle ?
at the end of February , the &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet published an article entitled &quot; Un@@ dis@@ ation in the Military headquarters . &quot;
in the general Staff , we grant concern with an increasing &quot; Islamic &quot; army which manifested himself among others in the abol@@ ition of the head@@ case for sol@@ dat@@ ors , wrote the newspaper .
the greater clean@@ ers at the army and the security forces is far@@ med .
in the middle of July , Erd@@ og@@ an had a further 73@@ 95 state military mo@@ ist , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 546 soldiers .
it seemed , when I was t@@ abled the military to the military .
gener@@ als earlier than the real lor@@ ds of the country .
three times as being called on appeal to their role as a watch@@ man of the world state of State .
after his election victory in 2002 , Erd@@ og@@ an ur@@ ged the power of the military step by step , not least to appeal to the reform of the European Union .
former officers said , Erd@@ og@@ an t@@ axi@@ ing specifically targeted a Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
in the magazine &quot; Voc@@ al Europe &quot; there was no longer called official officer , who sought after the coup attempt in persecution of persecution abroad , the Turkish army will be &quot; full of extrem@@ ists and sal@@ af@@ ists within a few years .
it does not mean that NATO could not leave NATO .
in the alliance , there are no doubt in the Alliance after the pur@@ ge of the Turkish Army .
leaders and operations are weak@@ ened , &quot; NATO diplom@@ ats say &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats .
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
there will be a new US immig@@ ration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , President Donald Tr@@ ump , cited by the media .
it looks before , reduce the legal immig@@ rants to 50,000 a year , stric@@ ter regulations for the planning of visa for temporary employees and limitations for families @-@ oriented visa .
the new rules are proposed by the Republi@@ can and supported by the President .
the bill should be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , wages and save $ billion for tax@@ pay@@ ers , and will do this by the U.S. to change the fashion in other countries such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Cards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent chains @-@ migration and replace the current system .
this new candidate procedure will come to the candidates that speak English , who will have the financial resources to support himself and knowledge that our economy will show , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted from the American media .
Ministry wants to san@@ e route for racing shuttle
again , in the past few months over the future of the racing section sh@@ utt@@ les were fought - now it is supposed to go fast .
still before the end of the year it is expected to be built on the tourist railroad , which leaves the tourist railway .
in order to secure the future of the racing shuttle to the long term , according to the manufacturer &apos;s information , construction work is expected to start in this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to order the distance of Ilmenau @-@ Renn@@ g , the country knows especially for the tourism important connection &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explained traffic state Secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Erfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost of the repair of the route , he reduced to about 2.5 million euros .
of this sum surplus the country 75 percent .
the contract , on which the shuttle is to be ordered also in the future of the country , will definitely be voted , declared S@@ üh@@ l .
the Ministry and the South @-@ eastern railway as a operators are already assembled about the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the road@@ map related to vehicles and quality standards , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the Ministry and the Railway Society will be closed for a period of eleven years .
thus the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle should be ordered for regular service on December 2017 .
the race @-@ shuttle is primarily popular with tourists from the railway stations of Ilmenau and Renn@@ stei@@ g mainly to tourists .
during the past months , in the course of a pilot project , the range of sufficient many people will be used to order them again in the future .
the circuit is also highly di@@ lap@@ id@@ ated in parts .
the Asc@@ ent of Sex Ro@@ bots is real , and we should worry about us
just as you thought it can &apos;t be crazy about 2017 , a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robot .
yes , indeed .
sex robots are currently a big thing .
recently the Foundation published for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ) ( FR@@ R ) initiated a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , emer@@ itus professor of rob@@ ot@@ ics and artificial intelligence at the University She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we must start to take their asc@@ ension .
customers can choose the eyel@@ ash of the robot , its form of ni@@ pp@@ le and type of fing@@ ern@@ a@@ gel choose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people are fun on them , but the company also supply lots of it , and we will still be able to see it more frequently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lord Shar@@ key said with the publication of his new report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a Sil@@ icon skin which feels warm , with the human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
the user may also custom@@ ize his robot also to its belie@@ fs &quot; and do all of them choose from the eye @-@ color of the robot through the shape of the ni@@ pp@@ le to the type or the color of his fing@@ ern@@ ails .
but it is still troubled because many robots have the &quot; personal@@ ities &quot; which would look like a Step@@ ford @-@ Woman Progressive .
modern sol@@ u@@ ppen have developed to robots with a Sil@@ icon fo@@ res@@ kin .
the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot makes it possible to adapt their users to adapt their robots to the properties which can be appe@@ aling like rel@@ ap@@ ty .
and then there are still the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex robot with pre@@ programmed personal@@ ities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which gives the impression of rel@@ ap@@ se and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with a &quot; advent@@ u@@ rous &quot; personality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality to what your personality is as good as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the site of True Compan@@ ion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so you like what you like , and they don &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
in the course of the day , she also has its mood - all like real people !
it can be tired to be fixed on counter or it can be &quot; in mood ! &quot;
there are many troubled aspects on this ascent of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships , but the inf@@ erior female properties that calls a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( it is here : ir@@ resist@@ ible ) Far@@ rah , but troubled one most .
on his site True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy is used with a vibr@@ ator but for males .
&quot; if women ( sic ) have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; it is called on the site .
however , these sex robots are not only a fet@@ ish or just just another sex lighter .
their birth and their increasing refin@@ ement point in a little dar@@ ker and deeper understanding in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal degree of Gender Equality to a desire after sex with sub@@ jug@@ ation as optional enc@@ ore .
most men are going to hold no sex robots , and during the FR@@ R your rising popularity remain , however , they still remain on the edge of consumer culture .
but what le@@ ak@@ eth out of the bound@@ ary zones , in regards to the spirit of time , in which we live , very instru@@ ctive .
and many people are not stran@@ gely or bel@@ ong@@ ated , until they are the free market for this purpose .
there is a certain over@@ cutting that these highly developed sex robots are threatened with a time in which the rights of women are threatened worldwide , in which the White House gives a pre@@ sidents whom women have failed to attack women .
the most dre@@ ad@@ ful aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the handmaid &apos; ) are not the graphic images that have been swal@@ lowed up and the cast eyes , but as realistic these vision .
the republic of Gilead is a jump but at the moment it does not feel like a big jump .
the goal behind this sex robot is to produce a physical simil@@ arity to real women as realistic as technically possible ( if also with por@@ no@@ star propor@@ tions ) .
their builders want to feel deser@@ ted that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
but , in the point , when it comes to their &quot; personal@@ ities , &quot; robots no real women represent .
you can &apos;t separate either from their companion or simply go away .
they have no medi@@ ation or a background story , nothing , what to independence or anything that could distur@@ b the imag@@ inations of total sub@@ jug@@ ation .
different to say : you are counter@@ f@@ eit slaves .
or to express it in the mode of 2017 : utilities
Tr@@ um@@ ps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney to the treatment of healthy lives
it has become a B@@ ins@@ en@@ fe@@ ish@@ list of the Tr@@ ump era , that the political shi@@ fts , which have the U.S. elec@@ torate , also have divided families in small format .
around Christmas and Ern@@ t@@ ed@@ ank@@ le there were newspapers in the US newspapers and suggestions about how to deal with the Hor@@ ror of Tr@@ ump .
we destroy all the supp@@ os@@ edly to make our filter bub@@ bles .
it has been noted less , the power Tr@@ um@@ ps , families .
I chose this because my c@@ ousin , a left @-@ oriented Di@@ chter@@ in , who lives in Chicago , long since long with the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York .
it rec@@ alled me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone who knows them , including the republi@@ can relationship with which it fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and quite independent on the same side .
in order to make the dining table this certainly is a good thing but it falls in a further context that this also brings significant risks with oneself .
the lens was strengthened by tr@@ ump , but the issu@@ ing effect of his presi@@ dency has the power to push us all by the right .
when we speak of &quot; Norm@@ alisation &quot; and Tr@@ ump , we refer to the best way that his bi@@ b will not be ph@@ ased out of a day .
however , there is still a more terri@@ fying long @-@ term scenario , in the Tr@@ ump Rep@@ ublic@@ ans of the right wing &quot; norm@@ alizes &quot; which suddenly appeared in a comparison to his standards , suddenly as an understanding of understanding .
I find me today of an active nost@@ al@@ gic for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s com@@ ic version of the insur@@ rection - the dog on the Aut@@ od@@ ach , which saw 14 % income tax ( but at least did we know like his tax return ) - both in comparison to Tr@@ ump in fact a very mild criminal off@@ ences .
when Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans must be spiritu@@ ally healthy to qualify as an un@@ meas@@ ur@@ able improvement .
when my cou@@ sine was in the city , we brought our children to Kar@@ ou@@ sel in Central Park , the largest of the Car@@ ou@@ sel &apos;s car park , and the best three dollars to spend in the city if you don &apos;t need any caffeine .
the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are cris@@ y and the animals turn to look full of fear over their own shoul@@ ders - very dark and the climate of music gives this to a notable way .
so many gates of a city are disappointed : the views of high buildings are old , the Sky@@ lines are familiar to offer plenty of exc@@ itement , and the reality of the city is not just right .
five and five years later , and I &apos;m still not completely over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss Cottage - the topic Pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not - but a large roundabout in the North of London .
the Central Park Kar@@ ou@@ sel is still a strange magical experience , as here two years old , an 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ th years can go on it and all have a great time .
when I could rate the car@@ ou@@ sel I would have given to him the full score , but fortunately no one has asked them .
on the other hand , I was forced to rate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card .
in the coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to pay with a 15 % tip of ti@@ pping - this to buy a little over the shop .
this does not only lead to a slow@@ down of what actually is a neutral change , but also exercise pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation in which no required is necessary .
the poor woman at the department store stood still exc@@ essi@@ vely , while I &apos;ve tired the experience , you make my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us with chest pain out of the prison hospital
Pist@@ ori@@ us has left the prison for a second time in jail .
last year , he was brought to the hospital for the treatment of Schn@@ itten , which he suffered from prison agencies according to a case in his cell .
Pist@@ ori@@ us was convicted of a first death sentence due to murder after murder of the prosec@@ uting attor@@ neys for murder .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ ella in the early morning of Valentine &apos;s early morning by giving them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ t@@ oria on them .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his gir@@ l@@ friend for a night int@@ ru@@ der who hid themselves in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention , this time against the six year prison sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , of which they say , they be too dense .
the National Prosec@@ ution authorities said that it will rise to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the obj@@ ection could be heard this year .
Pist@@ ori@@ us is a danger that his sentence is increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ uting attor@@ neys are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as a farmer , finds a notable egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the four @-@ t@@ ug@@ gle out of skins and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen have been released to the holidays and to the secondary schools .
three of the Res@@ ult students go to the high school , four in the secondary school .
school teacher Angel@@ ika S@@ itte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public during the civil house of Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen .
as a symbol of the school , 29 pupils were elected under the direction of Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der a young e@@ ag@@ les which grows in chick@@ ens , but then released into freedom .
in addition , the m@@ lower ch@@ ar led a musical with the title &quot; The Eagle in the h@@ ens &quot; . &quot;
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg , and caused it to out@@ breaks out of his chick@@ ens .
instead of a chicken kissed a small eagle was out .
but the hope of making it a chicken , spread out the eagle , spread out his wings on a high mountain .
afterwards the classes were three and four in the study of Y@@ v@@ onne Frank showed a chicken tolerance .
the h@@ ens dance with the young go@@ ck@@ les , the cylinder contributed to the bet .
the Adler stand for the integration , said school teacher Angel@@ ika S@@ itte .
the young is indeed different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( ch@@ icks ) , but it is one of them .
but he will never be like a chicken .
his determination be to be free .
they wish every quadru@@ ple that he feels in his new school .
it was followed by than@@ ksgiving to the colleagues , former training manager Michael Müller , who always jumps back in teaching positions , and the par@@ ental consent .
the ch@@ ken@@ ess is now over , the class teacher Sophia Schumacher .
they leave their pupils after two years of lessons only very ung@@ od@@ ly , because it was a really great time .
finally I got to leave the quad .
we conclu@@ de all students a song from summer time and holidays .
in the children of great joy , it broke out .
for the new school year , eight first @-@ prop@@ ellers have registered .

software update for diesel vehicles : what the affected people need to know now
how does the software update take place ?
have diesel driver to participate in the action ?
the most important questions and answers .
at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW @-@ Group software updates are offered for a total of around 5.3 million cars .
they are to improve the exhaust gas behaviour of vehicles of the Euro 5 emission classes and some Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ Diesel or worse are excluded .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin by ACE Auto Club Europe ass@@ ess@@ ments :
is the new action compulsory ?
no , the negoti@@ ated software updates are optional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory updates have only valid for vehicles , the Schuman Plan &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
its re@@ arm@@ ament has arranged the power station @-@ Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) .
how and from when are clients informed about updates ?
the manufacturers have announced fast implementation in the next few months , but still does not have any exact date .
Daimler has informed about any person concerned .
if it is due to an inspection , I will be done in its frame .
how long does the change equi@@ ps go up in total ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin .
the connections from the commitment of the manufacturer as well as from political printing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for we have seen , who did not act as a car manufacturer at the subject of the environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long shall the update take ?
the conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
period of time could be to get an appointment .
what do motor@@ ists do not drive from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?
the ACE will wait for you .
probably foreign manufacturers would pull , such as S@@ met@@ anin .
is there a massive price fall from Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE is afraid .
but just in the regions where the remaining dead are from .
in rural areas there are currently no impair@@ ment losses for older diesel engines .
the ACE , with a sale yet to wait .

we do the town life
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , goes to R@@ ente in the next year .
the site is already written - suitable applic@@ ants are ra@@ r .
W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister has been living since 31 years .
and the work makes him still great fun as he medi@@ ates in the Press Conference .
it reports varied , but also challenging tasks that wait for his success@@ ors .
at the same time , it ad@@ mi@@ red that no application fulfil@@ ment the requirements .
the town is looking for the next possible time a architects or construction engineer .
so - under the emp@@ t of the regular period of notice - enough time to be el@@ aboration .
since Has@@ lach joined the Administ@@ rative authority as a sub @-@ authority authority , candidates must demonstrate appropriate tests .
for this function wants to keep the city definitely .
if it won &apos;t be able to fill them out , the citizens would have to travel to Offen@@ burg until Offen@@ burg .
but Vienna is the city and himself important , says W@@ acker who reported from a good company climate as well as good mood between the authority and citizens .
more than 30 years in the office , some important projects have accumulated , looking back to the W@@ acker with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are doing the town of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is safe over the building and staff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the re@@ modelling of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen parking lot about are infected .
the Kin@@ zig bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium renovation is still subject .
the latter alone will strike with approximately 1.5 million euros on be@@ ech , &quot; when we make it right , &quot; W@@ acker estimates . &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks are waiting for my successor .
the work here is fun . &quot;
design be available for a city master big playing room .
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s separate building yard and G@@ ärt@@ ner@@ y can be used to flexi@@ bly re@@ acts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one can move much moving , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker , and the design of the fo@@ unders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are often praised by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the old town is listed as a ensemble under monument protection , it is important to have &quot; one eye for it , &quot; if new buildings are approved , emphas@@ izes the separ@@ ating Stadt@@ bau@@ meister .
the Stadt@@ bau@@ d has high responsibility .
he is the builder , &quot; at the end all goes through my table . &quot;
with assistance and coordination he can count on many long @-@ time employees : Markus Neum@@ u@@ er ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been working for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( deep construction ) for 15 years .
also , that his successor remains long , W@@ acker : &quot; we are looking for someone who really identified with the spot . &quot;
the continu@@ ity is not only important for a good operating climate , but also for the further design of the city .
whoever wants to be inher@@ ited by Roland W@@ acker should have studied architecture as a graduate engineer or Bachelor with architecture as a graduate engineer and have good knowledge of knowledge in the fields of construction and construction planning .
the Stadt@@ bau@@ at@@ amt under@@ stands high and low construction , building management , Gr@@ under@@ wer@@ bs@@ help , managing director of urban property , urban farm and municipal law , including sub@@ sid@@ y protection authority including monument protection .
bicycle on lines are thrown : southern route closed
according to the police , the blue bicycle from the railway line in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) had been thrown onto the lines .
these were so severely damaged , that the her@@ b@@ ating goods had to be moved .
the investigations go out of two male perpet@@ rators and seek after them since the night hours after them .
close to the site were witnesses of a pink tur@@ bul@@ ls and a bike driver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ anno@@ enst@@ rich &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokes@@ person Christoph Pos@@ ch for A@@ PA . &quot; &quot; &quot;
or the perpet@@ rators have brought themselves in great danger and end@@ anger@@ ed traffic .
apart from the damage to the Lo@@ k and the installation , as well as a delay @-@ minute drive and costs for rail transport , could also be reached by train to the perpet@@ rators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a total of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; considerable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said that the speaker has said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damages were returned on Friday afternoon , the rail traffic on the south route could be guided without disabilities .
scar@@ cely ten passenger cars were retired in the morning , two of which concerned the correspondence .
freight moves not , but they did delay .
according to Ö@@ BB spokes@@ person Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be exchanged around 200 meters of surface .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , milk products and chocolate could help IB@@ D ( infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory intest@@ inal disease )
red meat and chocolate can sound for your digest@@ ive system like a night@@ mare .
but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could lin@@ king the symptoms of patients with infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory bo@@ wel diseases .
the incur@@ able condition that affects approximately 1.3 million and in Great Britain 300,000 , causes mag@@ nets and fl@@ aps , recur@@ ring or bloody f@@ ights , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
while those affected is usually advised to alle@@ vi@@ ate flesh and milk products to alle@@ vi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers found at the Washington University that the essential amino acid tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an of proteins , enh@@ ancing immune cells , promote a toler@@ ant gut .
the conduc@@ tive researcher , Dr. Marco Colonna , explained that immun@@ cells in the intest@@ inal rou@@ ters to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes to hide themselves in food , not penet@@ rating in the body .
cells that are able to resolve inflamm@@ ation , are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without dam@@ aging sensitive fabric .
if the balance is too far in direction of inflamm@@ ation , it can result in a infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory intest@@ inal disease .
in experiments it was found that a kind of tolerance convey@@ ance immune cell in mice comes to carry out a certain bacter@@ ium in its bow@@ els .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an - one of the building blocks of proteins - to resolve the appearance of the cells .
Professor Colonna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacteria @-@ art - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ illus reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ oma , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance , manufactured .
the more tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an had the mice in their food , the more had they from these immune cells . &quot;
he pointed out that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and one of tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an rich nutrition toler@@ ated , less infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory bo@@ ath@@ us promotes if the same system is effective in humans .
the Post@@ doc@@ tor@@ ship in Dr. Lu@@ isa Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan , sought out a kind of immune cell that had been promoting tolerance when she found that a group of study mice had such cells , but a different group of the same tribe , but it had not been separated .
you thought that the difference with the intest@@ inal micro@@ bi@@ ds of mice had to do - the fellowship of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i that usually live in the gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal tract .
the mice of the mice were DNA sequ@@ enz@@ es and there were six bacter@@ ias , which were present in mice with immune cells , but without having missing in mice .
mice were detected in a ster@@ ile environment , so that they had not developed a intest@@ inal micro@@ bi@@ ome and developed this kind of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and immune cells .
to understand how the bacteria rise to the immune system , researchers left L. reu@@ ter@@ i in a liquid and then over@@ led small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe immune cells , which were isolated from mice .
immun@@ cells developed to toler@@ able cells of the cells .
as the active component of the fluid was cleaned , it proved to be a side product of the tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an Met@@ abol@@ ism , known as In@@ do@@ l @-@ 3 @-@ mil@@ actic acid .
when researchers saw the amount of tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an in the feed of mice , the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent , but when the tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an decreased , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan declared that people have the same toler@@ able carriers such as mice , and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i protect us from our gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ ines .
it is not known whether Tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an @-@ side @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i the cells of people develop such as mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an were found in people with infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory intest@@ inal disease .
she said , &quot; The development of these cells probably is something that we want to promote , since these cells control inflamm@@ ation on the inside surface of the gut .
potenti@@ als can lead high tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i to a extension of this population . &quot;
Jose Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has committed a &quot; gen@@ ius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic

the 40 million pounds description of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last pre@@ season game before the UEFA Cup starts on Tuesday , and impressive in the holder &apos;s role , as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira .
however , M@@ atic was not excluded from the preparation of the blues tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes to improve the Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho that he had to improve before the Premier League season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a gen@@ ius in the way he th@@ inks - he th@@ inks of football , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; three of four to get , thanks to the association , &quot; he added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happy if they get four of four , but they gave great efforts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; painted &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flew from Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state of Michigan and moved to the form of a Dream@@ liner above the United States , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens the form of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole was a stamina test for new engines .
Boeing had already done such advertis@@ ements already .
thus the number &quot; 787 &quot; and the Boeing logo was painted in the sky .
new demol@@ ition for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind turns off : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still the leader of the SPD , the Socialist Prime Ministers went on a certain concern with certain concern in Berlin .
merely a distur@@ b@@ ance from the party headquarters , merely a counter @-@ wind from the league - so was the most important desire of the election campaign .
since Martin Schulz the party has changed dramatically .
since then , the employees from the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus with growing inher@@ iting the events in the SPD reg@@ im@@ als capit@@ als .
what Schulz has got from there since the beginning of the year would be described with counter@@ winds no times in the approach .
there were deep advice .
and one after another .
according to the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal Government provides a general signal towards Ko@@ al@@ itions of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it shows a more : red @-@ green can &apos;t be sure to rule out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said CDU @-@ Secretary Peter Tau@@ ber der Ed@@ iting Network Deutschland ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the surprising leader of Fra@@ ction , a Green @-@ M@@ EP@@ s , threw the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) in a severe crisis .
five months before the Parliament election the red @-@ green coalition lost their one @-@ vote majority to the opposition of the CDU and F@@ DP opposition .
the Green Party Leader Michael Kell@@ ner has asked the ab@@ ro@@ ying low @-@ Sax@@ on Green Party of El@@ ke T@@ oll to return your mandate .
the tak@@ eover of the CDU signi@@ fies a clear delay of voters .
El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets has to return to her mandate , &quot; said the Federal Managing Director and elec@@ toral Commission of the Green Network Network ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it may not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; won &apos;t be a SPD election campaign , as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new Hi@@ ob@@ s@@ ambassador to the party headquarters in Friday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Weil , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands after the convic@@ tion of the El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets to the CDU without own government multilingual .
it is the preliminary point of a series of large and small cris@@ es in SPD state associations .
and no one knows what is going to be next .
the mis@@ ery began with unexpected defeat at the Saarland election in March .
a blue eye , more not , the com@@ ra@@ ids were min@@ ded .
according to the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
it was then that - and in fact it was much worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into de@@ mar@@ bles , the Düsseldorf @-@ Ple@@ ite broad@@ casts the party smoothly .
lab@@ oured the com@@ ra@@ des in the weeks after that time .
then , when they had just tried new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg .
and with him the next stroke came .
Mayor O@@ la@@ f Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD @-@ Land@@ esch@@ ef , lost his Nim@@ bus in that weekend , because he sat in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his town burned .
and because he was in the crisis communication according to that thing everything was wrong to make wrong .
since then , Sch@@ olz was fighting for political survival .
now also Stephan Weil .
because of the VW exhaust gas aff@@ air and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Lower Saxony Prime Minister had already been in criticism of the criticism .
r@@ ese re@@ fra@@ y were added .
nevertheless , or perhaps , perhaps because , in recent weeks , I tried to make acc@@ ents more stronger than in the past few weeks .
the former Mayor of the former Mayor of Hanover , whose power in Berlin was still not hidden in the field of Martin Schulz .
they left him , since they agreed with a stabil@@ ization of the party .
now that could occur the exact opposite .
there is no fault in the face of the party , because there is no fault whatever the party .
and Schulz don &apos;t even know .
the com@@ ra@@ des imp@@ ud@@ ly make the com@@ ra@@ des to keep its own ranks closed .
their wrath is aimed at the gre@@ enery , and especially on the ab@@ dic@@ ated par@@ li@@ ament@@ arians in T@@ jack@@ ets .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and demo@@ cra@@ cies , such as Mrs. T@@ ops presents her own career opportunities over the interests of all other , &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , CEO of Part@@ n@@ ines in the SPD Bundestag , the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
Ms. T@@ jack@@ ets has not been elected as a direct can@@ did@@ acy , but has been elected to parliament as a director of the Lower Saxony Green Party ( Lower Saxony ) .
the logical consequence would be that it returns to Mand@@ ate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , Head of the SPD Bundestag , pro@@ claim a &quot; un@@ democratic man@@ oeu@@ vre . &quot;
&quot; the voters of voters four years ago was clear : the people have made Stephan Weil to the Prime Minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who has candidate the Lower Saxony SPD as a top candidate to the Bundestag election , R@@ ND .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the personal career of a future CDU representatives said the election result &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he called to solve the back@@ grounds .
I want to know if there has been more or ongoing support of the CDU Lower Saxony .
funding of the centre III
who wants to renov@@ ate his house into the years , can get from the country shortly .
at this , Mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representative of ste@@ g city development on Wednesday in sensation .
at the beginning of the information event Sch@@ in@@ dler had a review of so far so far .
since 1991 it has been present in sens@@ es rehabilitation areas .
at that time , in the renovation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the Land of Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two @-@ thirds of the funding amount .
in the renovation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the surplus was still 60 percent .
for Sch@@ in@@ dler , the previous renov@@ ations are a &quot; successful project &quot; - it is finally important to promote and un@@ lock the inner development , not only new building areas .
on April 4 , the g@@ overning party of Karlsruhe decided to obtain information that there will be a san@@ itation zone III .
the sum amounts to 8@@ 33 333 euros , of which add 500 000 Euro from the country , the rest of the congregation .
how do you create a san@@ ction area ?
you will continue to investigate so sh@@ in@@ dler continue , where the &quot; really ancient &quot; houses are .
but it also plays a role in the planned area of interest existing in the planned area .
if necessary , the territ@@ orial borders may also shift again .
the jet@@ ty was on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; cell@@ ars presented the content of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; programme in which frames would then be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the core of the program are the Rev@@ it@@ alization of internal cities to improve the residential and operational conditions and expansion of infrastructure .
the measures would be an object @-@ continu@@ ance , that is called per plot , carried out .
finally the rehabilitation area would finally be determined as a statute .
the approval period for the promotion has been running since January 1 , 2017 until April 30 , 2017 .
until September this year , however , the current inventory would be carried out once again , within the framework of those involved in the rehabilitation area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in November or December , the pro@@ positi@@ onal shot will be made , that next year with the sanctions can be started . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann then explained that every municipality had to conduct the predicted pre @-@ investigations .
it is therefore to evaluate the urban abuse of cont@@ am@@ ity and decide when it is rehabil@@ it@@ ated and in what extent .
there will also be a san@@ e note for the respective plot in the land register .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again after feelings and make a picture of the situation , she promised them .
Got@@ zel stressed , a key success factor for the project is the participation of the participants .
therefore , there will be questionn@@ aires , which will be sent to citizens over the next few weeks , and can be filled up until the end of the summer holidays .
the Yellow Questi@@ onn@@ aire is the &quot; Building and Property Paper &quot; where it is among other things for the building state and the rehabilitation views .
in the gray Questi@@ onn@@ aire , the &quot; House@@ hold and Resi@@ dential &quot; , &quot; on the size , divi@@ ding and inhabitants of a residential tower can be made .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; arc &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is only to fill when working rooms at the building business premises . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , in mind that Got@@ zel pointed out that a full @-@ filled questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding .
Moreover , new construction measures are not eligible .
Sch@@ in@@ dler was still stressed that the distribution of the feed material after the &apos; Wind@@ screen principle &apos; - who first comes first , m@@ ah@@ lt first .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no funding for later &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Local II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; project , in order to make a restoration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tast@@ eful &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
British inventor himself sets a micro@@ chip to come with a hand movement in the home and car
a British inventor is the first in the country that is equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his office and even start with a hand movement his car .
Steven North@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thum@@ bs and poin@@ ter , now offers the service for businesses and individuals who want to simpli@@ fy their life with technology by the company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he has joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , a consult@@ ative an@@ a@@ esth@@ esia at the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the im@@ plant procedure is carried out after medical standard .
the technology resem@@ bles a cats and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and takes only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. North@@ am also wants to change the locks of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for an extra cost of £ 300 per lock .
the ver@@ married father of one has now fitted both at home as well as with his BMW Z4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the helm .
the promotional price of the White House cost tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands
the decision of the White House , a n@@ avy helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event , which raises the American production in the last month , costs tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the military , which have been transferred to the TI@@ ME Magazine , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars .
the green white S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D known as Marine One , when the President is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American programmes .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and Managing Director of the White House made a tour of all 50 states .
the helicopter was built in Connecticut with a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a fire engine from Wisconsin and a forkli@@ ft from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
the Military Office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter order or FRA@@ GO , barely 36 hours before the helicopter in the South La@@ wn , following the records of Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 ) , the unit that is responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just wanted to be aware , because it is an unusual event with great visibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the Com@@ man@@ ger of H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 on the eve of the event , the Deputy Military Tribunal for aviation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message showed that the helicopter arrived at the South La@@ wn at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning at the South La@@ wn for the event at 15 o &apos;clock , and so long stayed until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 in this evening .
note that if the departure from the White House should be delayed , due to the limitation of service hours a second crew would be needed for return flight .
during the event , the original air@@ crew was located during the helicopter while the security staff remained at the plane during the time on the plane .
out of the TI@@ ME &apos;s provided recordings did not clearly see whether a second flight crew was required .
the Hatch Act prohib@@ its state @-@ state property for political purposes .
records indicate that H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 has asked if the event might viol@@ ate the determination .
&quot; a question that we asked if it was a violation of the Hatch acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the Commander .
&quot; sounds like if you are shut up , &quot; said the Deputy Commander .
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not be covered by the Hatch Act .
but official events also have political issues .
at the event , the President gave a im@@ pet@@ us to reform of health reform that was in the Senate in the G@@ ange , and he prop@@ ag@@ ated the efforts to shift the government provisions .
the use of the aircraft that is known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon for political purposes .
Pre@@ sidents are obliged to use them for the trip .
but their use only for a photo OP , is unusual .
Tr@@ ump conducted an investigation into February by the presidential plane in front of his first campaign r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that are described above the use of the presidential flight by its predecessor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is inspired by the show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 states that are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Deputy Press Award of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 Occup@@ ations often lead training flights in the area around Washington and South La@@ wn by forcing the US President in the White House with precise centimeters .
as Tr@@ ump at the beginning of July at the G20 summit in Germany , H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 led the White House of 58 exercise courses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event was one of the airline &apos;s training equipment for the month , said a civil servants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hel@@ ik@@ op@@ ter units flew in addition to 11 hours a day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support . &quot;
the White House said that the tax@@ pay@@ ers did not have the burden for any of the other pro@@ ps which were presented at the event .
a speaker of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky said that the company had not been involved in this helicopter in the South La@@ wn .
H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 does not provide a budget drawing for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to the General Ministry of Defense Ministry for the financial year 2017 , the Do@@ D proceeds for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is however 24.@@ 380 USD per flight .
records of the unit recorded flight time of the airplane than 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House argu@@ ed that the actual costs for the operation of the helicopter is far below that rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers on the basis of estimates for issu@@ ing rates is highly Irish , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include personal , maintenance , and many other hidden costs which are contained in the annual means . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , the workshop kits for Do@@ D do not contain personnel costs but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and contract .
at that time , the former press brie@@ fing of the White House , S@@ ean Sp@@ itz , the use of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present these week things going to America , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ ade . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and I know that S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I think of it , hundreds , if not even thousands of people depend on them .
and I think of how most Americans are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment , for which so many Americans have ti@@ relessly worked .
it is , of course , to raise it . &quot;
it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump was inter@@ ned with the helicopter when he entered his tour through the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire brig@@ ade .
in the White House , Tr@@ ump said to representatives of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and scher@@ sleben with the media on its own fleet of corporate products .
&quot; I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky very good , &quot; said the President , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;

how America can harm OMV
really happy Donald Tr@@ ump did not work when he sat on Wednesday evening his signature under the law to deep@@ ening the sanctions against Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his words , the law adopted a few &quot; un@@ constitutional &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reaction of Moscow also was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels was fo@@ amed against the U.S. im@@ pet@@ us .
after all , the draft stipul@@ ates that European companies can help the Russians , to build gas pi@@ pel@@ ines into the EU .
since then , investors of the domestic OMV is co @-@ financed together with other European firms supporting the construction of the Russian Baltic expedition North Stream 2 .
the drug is great .
nevertheless , it is too early for a estim@@ ation of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil company .
in fact Donald Tr@@ ump even would have to raise the sanctions with Executive Order to life .
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could cause which the group could stop and what could happen to him . &quot; &quot; &quot;

roll back@@ ward : the city presents 46 kitchen items
the city organizes the K@@ ita @-@ noon table again .
with fixed response partners for children and an assignment to the team .
the clock is turned back to the urban kinder@@ garten .
as of September 1 , the city of Kre@@ feld will take over the dining area in the urban kinder@@ garten facilities ( Kit@@ as ) again .
for Son@@ ja Pom@@ er@@ anz , Deputy Head in the Department of Youth A@@ id , is that good news : &quot; we are pleased all very pleased . &quot;
cooked , continues beside house : a Cat@@ erer takes over this task and delivers fresh@@ ly cooked ch@@ illed .
the city runs in the fields of fields of 46 kinder@@ garten , in 44 the children for lunch have a warm meal .
in the last day@@ time , 2800 children were seated at the tables , and the need to grow steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are not only children who are taken care of 45 week@@ days in the K@@ ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the offer also applies in the 35 @-@ hour supervision , if children remain until 14 pm . &quot;
46 participants from September 1st , kitchen service : you are warm the delivered meals , complement them about let@@ tu@@ ce , raw food and fruit , por@@ tion@@ ate the meal individually , leave the meal , cleaning , rinse and clean the kitchen .
&quot; the employees are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
size - there are two @-@ group as well as seventh troop units - decides on the ti@@ met@@ able circumference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the kitchen towels are now &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ita @-@ Team , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz happy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much stronger , and it is easier to implement ped@@ agog@@ ical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this reason it is : healthy food and cooking lessons .
&quot; children shall help to prepare food . &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen staff may be meaning@@ ful .
also for the children .
&quot; you have a well @-@ known force in the K@@ ita , a person who tru@@ sts in them , and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continu@@ ity is important for children .
the pur@@ ge of the K@@ ita @-@ conference - so far the task of kitchen forces - will be done in the future of special cleaning agents .
this variation - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - also has the charm improvement of the kitchen performance even the charm , which they set out in the cost @-@ comparison between self @-@ reg@@ ain and foreign exchange for the city as the most economic development , it says from the press department .
and that , although 46 part @-@ time workers are re @-@ set .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours are not so strong at about 750 persons in the correc@@ tive area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;

G@@ MB @-@ concern about investments in the Mc@@ Vit@@ ie factory in Glasgow
a union membership would like to make a union with man@@ ners of the Bis@@ ku@@ ite manufacturer Mc@@ Vit@@ ie on long term commitment to production in their plant at Glasgow .
G@@ MB Scotland said that the company has weigh over the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross location .
more than 500 employees work in the plant , which was created next to other products Hob@@ no@@ bs and R@@ ich Tea K@@ ek@@ se .
Mc@@ V@@ ities owner Pl@@ adi@@ s said that he has invested more than 5 million pounds in the last few years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that employees and trade union representatives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be first experienced if their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a letter to the company &apos;s branch of the company called G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vit@@ ie &apos;s , &quot; concerns the financing for the moderni@@ zation of production lines . &quot;
G@@ MB @-@ senior organizer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; the fact that we can win no clear@@ ness over the business requirements and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , regarding our members .
generations of families worked here and the working forces focus strongly on the local community and the Greater Region Glasgow , a crucial pillar for de@@ cent employment in an area with high unemployment and soci@@ ally dis@@ advant@@ age@@ ous .
therefore , under the perspective of work@@ places , wage and prosper@@ ity , and before the background of Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and chronic production process , the eastern end of Glasgow strongly ur@@ gently need a floral production loss at Mc@@ Vit@@ ie . &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of Pl@@ adi@@ s said : &quot; the branch manager at T@@ oll@@ cross has only received a letter of G@@ MB Scotland yesterday , and the company will react directly to this , since we estimate continuous commitment to employees and trade union representatives .
two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were discussed .
we discussed with the staff , that we are like all companies working in an extremely competitive and uns@@ af@@ e economic climate , our business drives constantly and that applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive .
they added : &quot; in recent years we invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross @-@ site , particularly in production lines and operational improvements .
we recognize the legacy of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site full and quite an . should our operational processes will change at location , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to learn this . &quot;
the PS@@ G Barcelona war@@ ns at Ne@@ ym@@ ar three years ago ?
the site of La League may you interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Germain in pursu@@ it of the persecution of Ne@@ ym@@ ar after they left a quote of £ 189 million , but have been war@@ ned in Barcelona over three years before the world record ?
the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record over the double of the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United in the last season .
after the termination is Ne@@ ym@@ ar to the most expensive player in the world and the most highly paid professional athletes of the world . PS@@ G provides sal@@ aries of more than 500,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is thinking about the way how Ne@@ ym@@ ar has given its way to outside , although a source in the vicinity of the Catalan board insi@@ sts that the club has always given its best to take care of him from Santos in 2013 .
but the football world was war@@ ned about three years ago by the PS@@ G president in front of this view ?
when Manchester City 2014 was interested in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ i@@ di , Nasser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for each club , who wanted to sign one of the best players from PS@@ G .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not careful because they know that if they touch one of our players , then we will contact the opposition to them , and we will contact their players &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
but if they try to sign one of our players at sign , it will have consequences . &quot;
Barcelona seems to have exceeded this line , with the Spanish club &apos;s beginning of this summer interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti .
PS@@ G clearly did that it would not allow it to travel to the International of Italy in any circumstances and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by taking one of its price for Ne@@ ym@@ ar .

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report de@@ bur@@ dened Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger
the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ en@@ atzen report to the abuse of mis@@ sil@@ es Pope Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
the author of the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the Miss@@ it@@ ch@@ and@@ al at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ en@@ atzen continues for discussions .
Christian Proph@@ ets , spokes@@ person for the reform@@ ist movement &quot; We are church , &quot; declared by the former Reg@@ ens@@ burger Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the emer@@ ge Benedict XVI , a debt relief .
it would be the appearance of the Catholic Church to serve when Mu@@ eller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep@@ est regre@@ t for their own sub@@ missions or their time wrong evaluation of the processes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Vatican Law &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ servat@@ ore Rom@@ ano , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , critic@@ ised that by force on violence at the domain names &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two measures &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was measured . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as regards the inter@@ ventions in Regensburg , no one would have to avoid &quot; dirty and damage acts , &quot; the author of Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , hist@@ ori@@ ans and member of the national Italian Bio@@ eth@@ ics Committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the attraction , the Catholic Church as a source of all evil , is already part of everyday experience and prepar@@ es the public opinion about that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also Prince of Th@@ urn and tax@@ is said in the interview with Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are happy to go to the church . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are happy to go up to the church . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , she pointed out that in their adolesc@@ ence , they had been a completely normal ped@@ agog@@ ical means , &quot; in order to be done with kids , as I was one , ready to be finished . &quot;
they are un@@ fair , present ben@@ ch@@ marks for earlier decades , because the world has changed .
in connection with the reports about the abuse of abuse often also Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared .
entirely at wrong , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who was written with R@@ atz@@ inger to memor@@ andum the book &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says E@@ emann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all that had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report , written by the dioc@@ ese Regensburg with the En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment lawyer Ulrich Weber ?
a total of 5@@ 47 Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ en@@ atzen were killed between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s &quot; with high pl@@ au@@ sibility &quot; victims of over@@ took , 67 domain names sexually ab@@ used .
in the final report , it was said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who was active from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg : &quot; briefly , it can hold that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases , forms of physical and psych@@ ic violence .
the punishment for pupils could even be severe even at a high level of motiv@@ ating .
in contrast to numerous other charges , many victims were estim@@ ating the general humanity of R. estim@@ oni@@ als and therefore in numerous cases even positive memories with him . &quot;
in the interview E@@ emann , why the final report on the Miss@@ it@@ chs@@ sk@@ and@@ al at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger domain Georg R@@ atz@@ inger went to the opinion of his opinion .
Mr. E@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; inci@@ dents of non@@ violence at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ en@@ atzen , &quot; a contra@@ dic@@ tory image of Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for one lifting many students &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; out of humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , it appears as Chol@@ eri@@ ker and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , which became the eye @-@ sof@@ tw@@ ist when a domain kit brought no top performance .
how do you consider as his biograph@@ er this final report ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if one read the effort and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask , why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is at all at all .
just eight pages dedicated to him and it is mark@@ edly acquitted of every sus@@ pic@@ ion of the medi@@ ation or for@@ age in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the violence at the pre @-@ school had occurred outside of its effici@@ encies .
one can refuse to him if it was too late or first clari@@ fies it not serious enough .
the gram@@ mar school , which he worked , was published by practically all respon@@ dents as - as literally - &quot; salvation , &quot; the heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot;
so the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is a very excellent witness , describes him as a &quot; warm &quot; , very popular &quot; and &quot; compreh@@ en@@ sible , &quot; as an extremely reliable teacher who provided the guys regularly with cakes , bis@@ cu@@ its and Bon@@ b@@ ons , and from grapes of children .
merely a minority is compl@@ ained about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and his high @-@ moti@@ onal@@ ity that led even to W@@ ut@@ ou@@ chen .
that he did not only threw himself with chairs and the key and on the ground , but also ear@@ ching guys in the hair or ears , he has already given himself a few years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and exc@@ used for this .
however , in his honour , it must be said that such educ@@ ators in the un@@ questi@@ oned time , the 1960s and 1970s , were widespread , with parents as in teachers .
do you still know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think everybody was born before 1968 .
I also have experienced that in a world school , one state gram@@ mar school .
compared with what it is actually in this report , namely the terrible sexual abuse and violence at the school , the fre@@ il@@ let Bag@@ at@@ ellen are .
since you &apos;re asking himself to do not with his acquain@@ t@@ ness and his role as the brother of Benedict XVI , many media had gone down on him .
the Bavarian Pope himself , as many as they never understood him , are still increasingly je@@ al@@ ous .
the truth is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
in connection with the report much about the topic of abuse at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ en@@ atzen station was reported in connection with the report .
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is going to report any failure or a visit with regard to sexual abuse on the burden of sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : very clearly no .
no one of the 67 victims of sexual ass@@ or@@ ations claims to have committed themselves to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were inaugurated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never saw me to speak with my father or my mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said an interested representative for the others , &quot; It was me all very embar@@ r@@ assing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the true problem during the En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment of sexual abuse , and is that most victims were silent .
if they did not commit their parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then definitely not for a choir leader , however , certainly would have been a colleague of the perpet@@ rators .
how do I evaluate the R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of abuse of abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a questi@@ oned student he formulated this : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... see I ... no case , in which he reck@@ oned ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) tim@@ ely perc@@ eive and could have been able to stop their perpet@@ rators .
I think it ... also for truly ab@@ sur@@ d that it is expected to take him ... Bu@@ ben in ur@@ gent or clear@@ er or even rather opened , as compared to their parents , Inter@@ nat@@ s@@ leit@@ ern , Confi@@ denti@@ sts , etc .
that man speaks with him about sex ... - un@@ th@@ ink@@ able . &quot;
thus the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; that in the lead to affected pupils and / or whose environment , in the context of the investigation , could not be confirmed . &quot;
for sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is free from everyone .
so it cannot be accused him that prevents it from or to display it .
therefore no reason to bring his good name to these resist@@ ors , as it was in some cases , unfortunately .
in the media was a lot of &quot; non@@ violence &quot; at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ en@@ atzen . &quot;
the previous report of Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of his report .
does he have to live with this approach ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the big problem that in the coverage everything was mixed and sc@@ oring in a huge mel@@ ange from sexual abuse and violence and somewhere in the middle of that , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but just that is a mis@@ use of the report .
there will be clean separately : between the school and the high school of the domain , between sexual abuse and violence , we say once , other pre@@ ference .
Moreover , the report deals from the time since 1945 , so also from four decades , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is not a choir director of the domain name .
the whole terrible test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases , in which boys had been ir@@ relevant and pain@@ stak@@ ingly , and among them had been horri@@ fied , took all at the school in Et@@ ter@@ zh@@ ausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where people have to have re@@ igns .
but with whom , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he got the boys only on the face when they were already at the domain of the cathedral .
on what was the very most witnesses , the subject &quot; Pre@@ school &quot; tab@@ oo .
there was only happy to be escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; par@@ a@@ ean &quot; states .
what was different from the gram@@ mar school ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : since there was no discipline , but no sa@@ wn violence .
and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , at which the report comes to the conclusion that &quot; many victims were estim@@ ating the general humanity of R. ( and therefore in numerous cases even positive memories with him . &quot;
as a result , the design remains , to have taken away .
but despite all efforts , the report was only defin@@ iti@@ zed only two time periods , in which it was reported by states on the pre @-@ school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish himself and from their predecess@@ ors at a school , which he didn &apos;t worked and responsible , ( so the witness ) wanted nothing to hear , and then again around 1993 .
for Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the ears consumed by Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , since 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ as@@ atz@@ ymn@@ asium who even re@@ produced the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this indicates that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will continue practic@@ ed the test penalty in the pre @-@ school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
already in view of the risk of negative symptoms , he is ur@@ gent .
this was , of course , as legal clarity when testing was long ago in Bavaria .
prior to that , it occurred in a legal gray zone , as every one knows about us .
it was difficult for him to estimate that the affected people might have been over@@ powered or dramatic , where the ad@@ missible limit was exceeded .
but it can &apos;t say too , he would have gone ast@@ ron@@ ed .
that is just not right .
only in 1980 the test penalty was officially abolished in Bavaria in Germany .
Fürst@@ in Gloria of Th@@ urn and Taxis claimed that it is un@@ fair to use today &apos;s ped@@ agog@@ ical standards at the time of time .
how do you see that ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : we are talking about the &quot; Fall@@ stri@@ ck of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; thus the danger to evaluate the past in today &apos;s moral standards .
there is already right in the prin@@ cess .
but , of course , not for sexual abuse , who was ab@@ h@@ ack@@ able to all times , and not for what has been broken down in pre @-@ school education and violence against innocent children &apos;s disease , which goes far beyond that time .
that is all awesome and I &apos;m glad that it is finally ready to work .
but at the same time I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because all that had nothing to do with him .
his funds for discipline and punishment , for h@@ ig@@ saws and their ears were widespread in the 1970s .
when physical punishment is forbidden , he has also been con@@ stri@@ cted .
what is the picture of his real time , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger has been given to you for the book &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; ?
came the theme test again to the language ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedict XVI , tells of his perspective , as the domain atzen only played a side role .
nevertheless , I did not forget that he led a rig@@ orous reg@@ iment .
but also this has to be said : without these perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without the un@@ conditional discipline , it would be hardly possible to form a institution of Wel@@ tran@@ g , true culture ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition that went to tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with cookies and Bon@@ b@@ ons alone , one does not make any big singer , and in front of every success , equal to which area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ floo@@ ded .
than what people do you have experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger at the talks about their books ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : I &apos;ve met my work on the book and beyond that I &apos;ve witnessed over wonderful , hum@@ orous , deep g@@ believers and heart @-@ good people , from which one could not imagine that he could do only a fly something .
I get regularly with , as many former domain names still today , 23 years after his retirement , regularly contact him to visit him . he is almost blind - and him as a member of her family .
those who are not forgiven to day until today , so that it was strictly strictly to them , are clearly in the minority .
most of the domain names are than@@ k@@ ful to him today that he enrich@@ ed their lives and brought them to the world of music .
and that it is always a good , v@@ ä@@ ter@@ ous teacher - a str@@ ingent father , f@@ iss , that may be - but also a del@@ ight@@ ful resp@@ ect@@ ful , to which they still looked up today and honour it .
and , please , once again : everything that you th@@ rows to him are Educational methods that were at the time at the time .
we can be glad that we have overcome this time .
but it is highly un@@ just , a man just because he is promin@@ ently and one more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al sin @-@ bo@@ ck .
there is the evil intention that stands behind it only too obviously .
for the report which has just been published , re@@ lie@@ ve him .
now the an@@ oun@@ ding areas would have acquired a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria and probably nobody wanted to know the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ en@@ atzen , finally in peace .
