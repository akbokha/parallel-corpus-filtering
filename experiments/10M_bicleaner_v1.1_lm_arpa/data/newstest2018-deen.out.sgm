<seg id="4">Small gardeners generate a single basis of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official card Münch supports exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is nervt when land cards are not currently available.</seg>
<seg id="7">It knows anyone who had to go to excitement because the Auto-Navi instead of a green meadow showed.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historic country cards of the digital Bavaria-Atlases, an offer of the geoportal Bayern of state government, are all other than currently - but is therefore very revealing.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is clear how towns and municipalities in the spread-area of the Munich Merkur has changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria-Atlas is a flicketing tapestry, which one recognize as such as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the great overview map for cities and municipalities in more detailed maps, so-called great-position sheets, was incorporated.</seg>
<seg id="13">It originated according to the Bavarian Authority administration between 1810 and 1864 and skip the first survey of Bayerns.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army invaded Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon was a survey of the occupied country and gave a topographic survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even when the French troops were moved with the Peace of Lunéville from 9 February 1801, they were the present neighbours who created the idea of a comprehensive Bavaria card.</seg>
<seg id="18">Kurfürst Max IV Joseph drove the project ahead, founded the "Topographic Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian Authority administration.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Urquonssheet for Munich comes from 1856 and is like all others on the Bayerische Staatsoper's website.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison early / Today is the example of the state capital at the most impressive.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is subduster, which is still relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was granted 21 years after the map of the map, so in 1877, the district of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today Unteroffling is located in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of submissions are concentrated in 1856 at today's Plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today the Westpark is, you can see nothing as an fields - at first glance: when in, a smaller part card with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten entries from the so-called "Urals" which was derived from the fundamental tax.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "small plots show no farmers there today - but small gardeners" "" "Land in Sun" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is characterised by the north of the sendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, since 1810 scene of the Oktoberfest, was actually a meadow - and no concrete desert in the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar gives the historical map an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the Urquonscape we read in the area of the present district au-Haidhausen not just to the street name "or from the Andes" on the fan "or from the Andes" on the fan "- but also in big letters" wander Anstalt. "</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here on the outside field road, they once locked people with madness.</seg>
<seg id="33">There was 1858 / 59 the Munich Circle-Ir@-@ anstalt "On the Auer fan."</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872 Dr. Bernhard von Gudden managed the institution - that psychiatrist who is brought to King Ludwig II in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was progressive for his time and finished the tune of the so-called" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="37">For 280 patients had been first place, later extended to 500 places.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sometime, this capacitance wasn't enough - the reason for the construction of the Kreisky complex in hair 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">Since 2006, the Isar-AMPER-Klinikum Munich-Ost is one of Germany's largest psychiatrists.</seg>
<seg id="40">On the area of the former Auer Anstalt people meet young people in the Munich Salesianum.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and walked in a youth house with training conditions.</seg>
<seg id="42">West lies the football pitch of the TSV München Ost, east of the houses of the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">In 2015, the children's house "Casa don Bosco" was built in 2015 - in an architectural approach to the original building of the Irish house, which was destroyed during the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "the Marienplatz was listed as" "" "main square" "", "the merchants" "" "Kaufinger alley." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">A decisive change brought the Second World War also in the Heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">In December 1944 the bombs of the Allies broke out many holes into the city center.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big stayed until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institut, small business houses and a tomb chapel from the Middle Ages were once stood at the Marienhof, where these days the preliminary work and on 5 April 2017 the groundbreaking ceremony will take place for the second S-Bahn route.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider, the old Munich-map can compare with the aerial view from today - and fill up the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil rights released itewarm for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for Promoting Color has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Missouri due to discriminating policy and racial attacks by the state of Missouri.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory Board for the State of Missouri, which is to go into effect until 28 August 2017, calls for visitors and missourians, when travelling through the State, as a number of questionable, road-based incidents in the whole state must be noted, and here, it is stated in the opinion of the Group.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently approved law of Missouri, which makes people severe, discrimination against discrimination, as well as the prosecution authorities of the state, who are disproportionate on minorities, to admit the group of evasion, said the NAACP.</seg>
<seg id="54">"they have violations of the civil rights to happen people.</seg>

<seg id="56">"we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet."</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first warning that the organisation issued for a state in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group quoted events such as racist tracede against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died in fragile circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no petrol in custody during the journey, and caused by the police in Missouri, without having to be accused of having the accused.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also has a recent report by the Office of the Attorney-General of Missouri, in which it is shown that black drivers in the state will be 75 percent more common than white.</seg>

<seg id="64">The traveler is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to complain a company because of living or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberian Union (ACLU) Reisewarities for Texas and Arizona, issued after the states immigration authorities, to undertake people for immigration authorities, which will help people to move towards the ACLU.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel distances are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but at the last time stakeholder groups have used the measure as reaction to certain laws and trends within the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">Electric fence project is Elementar</seg>
<seg id="68">The Heredacher Weidecaun project is a successful project and will continue in the next year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU-German duo had a picture of Peter and Kordula Kovac provided a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">At the Rechtwing of the Andemann family, representatives of the CDU local authorities met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MEPs.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann performed first insights into its operations in which he cultivated 55 hectares of land and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows, and also many young-animals looked after and in five dwellings.</seg>
<seg id="72">The "Black Forest" is responsible for him the alternative market value for the milk of its cows, so swivot.</seg>
<seg id="73">Exclusively regional it comes to the table at the Feriengo table.</seg>
<seg id="74">Since he also BLHV-Chairman of Fischerbach, he called the WeidezaunProject as "Elemental Project."</seg>
<seg id="75">I can't engarable on such a steep surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="76">The green space for a lot of work, many things must be processed with the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have been here with the conditions and the topography," "" "stressed Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003, he acquired the elternal operation and acquired this without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if it lead no bio-operation.</seg>
<seg id="79">For mayor Thomas Schneider was clear: "the municipality has recognized the importance of the fence project and is happy about the leader support."</seg>
<seg id="80">In costs of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare the farmers would have to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">One hope that the view of the surfaces could be pulled out yet a whole while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have, are people who work in agriculture and do not make thoughts on this way," "" "stressed the mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers in the review often stand in the review</seg>
<seg id="84">A total of 25 plots of eleven participants were enclosed in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">The retention area is thus 40 hectares, which may not be stopped until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Of the total costs in the amount of 71 500 Euros, half of the leaders took part in the municipality of Fischerbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Consequently, the farmers had to invest €12 610, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of frandecaun.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the big advantage is the longevity of the fences," said Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">Kordula Kovac stressed: "you do not make a good job, without farmer and country women do not work."</seg>
<seg id="90">Also for Peter white: "here the best foods are produced."</seg>
<seg id="91">The rural conservation area (LPR) Baden-Württemberg facilitates the state subsidies of Weidega.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is the position of the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">A prerequisite is the presence of a lPR of the lPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, the inoccluding area should not be swepered (slope above 35 per cent) and must be threatened by retrestness.</seg>
<seg id="95">There is currently the proposal of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build on 16 kilometres of fence.</seg>
<seg id="96">The rate of retention is 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump now occupies the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest character of a regime change is to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans estimate that as every other - hence the sorption of Saddam Hussone at the Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, knew what he did when he had a symbolic axe in a heat strife with Jim Acosta from CNN on the proposals for the drastic limitation of legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To stay fair, Miller does not handle the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of bootees and liberty-imitators would have been gyneyed if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he touched their significance, and in particular the importance that you been attributed to the famous poem by Emma Lazarus, 17 years after completion of the monument, its base was added.</seg>
<seg id="105">When Miller Acosta descripated: "I don't want to enter a full thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that lightens the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem, which you refer to, was later added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is truly correct but as he formulated it himself, it's not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary response to the ascending words of Lazarus, the only one in which a state not only charges any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your labours, your poor, and your oppressed masses, which sought to breathe freely, and the afflicted waste of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time where the "elevating waste" was better to see on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he clearly did that people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict due to the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural debate: it is indeed a conflict in fact to the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and their friends who were able to place their words after their death on the basis - did not know that they were a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should display the connections between French and american republics by pointing the feminine portrait of the freedom in an abused classic representation of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus modified this meaning: in its poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And there is a very different name: mother of the Exilant.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the thunderous with the picture is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on the American national vism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus has changed the meaning of the statue, people wanted to change this way back to the right wing.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great cry of Rush Limbaugh, a type of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was unable to bring out the American flame into the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty is going ahead.</seg>
<seg id="119">It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch shall not shine the way into the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual is limbaugh here on anything.</seg>
<seg id="122">The importance of the statue is quite and even a question of the point of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative act of Lazarus existed in it to see how they had seen from the exhausted, but hopeful people after long and often horrible trips on the deck of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the truest sense to see the world from perspective of people who seek refuge and improve their life.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue says to them the words of hope and the welcome you need to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And this is not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to know.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch shall not shine the way, but the hatred, which is the only source of power, ignite.</seg>

<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two fleets were the team of Great Britain.</seg>
<seg id="130">The performance of the Athletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent of the world championship can afford a massive contribution to the team. "</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athletes were selected for London in 2017, which kicks off on Friday.</seg>

<seg id="133">"" "" "" "we welcome it, and we will try to understand, and we will continue to find out," "" "said Black." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">"I Speak with people in the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think that something has done to do what they did.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes remember that something has done to do what they did.</seg>
<seg id="136">British Athletics: it has something to do what they did.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type of road.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, among them Laura Muir and Andrew Butcher, who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m route, while Eilidh Doyle from the team was chosen as a team leader.</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eilidh is quite modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">Their capitals, unbelievable, "says Black.</seg>
<seg id="142">"a range of athletes, whether they were Scottish or, wherever they live or exercise, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.</seg>
<seg id="143">The emotion and the real feeling, the Eilidh had all of course, were great. "</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth-Silver Medallists who will compete with the 400 m Hurdles in their fifth world championships, says that it is "unbelievably" that 16 scots are in the British team.</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which had been reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The middle-haul runners, Muir will lead five British and two European records last year.</seg>
<seg id="147">It will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m races.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman to observe the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembers their first world championships, when the only other Schotte in Team Lee McConnell was.</seg>
<seg id="150">The club capitals says that they are "enormously proud" to the fact that many of their scourteous did not only belong to the team, but in some cases also at the medals and the finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"" "" "" "the special about Team captains in this, lies that it was voted by the other members of the team so that my team mates have voted for me and voted to me something very special for me," "" "she added." ""</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously, I'm very proud of all the scots that belong to the team.</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we came.</seg>
<seg id="154">And they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb on Podien.</seg>
<seg id="155">What my speech pertaining to chapters?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think it went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I only noted that we are very happy in this situation since we have a home World Championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it's really important to set on this home use and take advantage of that we are again at the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go out and compete, and it's just like a great atmosphere there outside. "</seg>
<seg id="160">Block from critics on Facebook: beatib you not for a public office, if you do not wear the elecoms of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad media.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him because of all, from the Domestic Policy to its political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He shot at the critique, safe.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not put his critics to silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">Because in 1783 Washington said: "the act of freedom can be taken away - and, stupid and dumb, we will be led to the slaughter."</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan who needs to work more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberian Union accused him in the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The staff of the governors dismissed the complaint as a frivolous, and the online commentary was full of a counteraction with "Na," and?. "</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's only facebook," said many people.</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important when there is a type such as Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican Governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is astonishing.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest approval of the nation's 50 governors.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary rotating head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a strong hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very sent to use Facebook as a primary means to connect to his voters and defile his haarless head to chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore, the blocking of people who come onto the side of the governors - which is a public forum which is designated as official and of employees who are paid by public tax-Dollars - unnecessary and eventually dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post defense Hogan spokeswoman Amelia Chasse, the acts of the governor and argued that the comments of the comments was nothing more effective than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the image of wheels or clips or hash filled people online that swing the whip online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post spoke with some of the real people that were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are only true people who speak with their chosen drivers: a teacher, a businessman and a priest, no Trolle.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said they respectful that their comments were respectful and not benefited.</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appeals to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Attorney at Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hassert, but she asked them to break them.</seg>
<seg id="186">"" "" "" "I realized that I was disappointed that there was no reaction on hate and other current News" "", "wrote in the commentary volume of the message" "" "The Post." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="187">"I don't know this idea, if a number of people on the same topic takes place, then they will be absent by some more than a so-called collections and do not recognized as a large group of people affected."</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "what employees of the governors as" "" "concentrated spam attack" "" "would be called" "" "intercede" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to trim a message by simply blocks a critic or a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in former times, if one had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect newspapers with the critical traces and to burn, and to kill or destroy them.</seg>
<seg id="191">But just this happens digital.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public officials to criticized Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is complained of Twitter users who have blocked from his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question fell last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County expire the First Averment, according to the US District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria when she joined a elector of her Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from ACLU because of his use Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time of Washington Washington had the time of affordable portos a similar effect like the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers varied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter pens beat on his leadership.</seg>
<seg id="200">And even Washington had anonymous Trolle.</seg>
<seg id="201">"" "the people, the pseudonyms such as" "" "Valerius," "" "Beliscus," "" "Portius" "", "wrote all letters to newspapers, Washington's Washington decisions." ""</seg>
<seg id="202">Petitions that criticized his position on the contract of Amity, trade and navigation with the Great Britain, overwhelmed its office, according to the historical records that were collected by the online Papers of George Washington Project.</seg>
<seg id="203">But he didn't put them to silence.</seg>
<seg id="204">Free speech, opinion, discourses are on the basis of our nation.</seg>
<seg id="205">And true leadership means to accept that.</seg>

<seg id="1388">Trumps appointed new Chief of Staff to restrict the media Abstinence of the President.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Perhaps John F. Kelly can do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Politico reported that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to restrict the information flow to President Trump - including reports of the news media - in hope to keep the boss on a smooth course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece by Reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, in his first day of working with leading employees, he introduced a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House which he wanted to repair: bad information leading to the hands of the president.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the staff that information on him should flow - whether on paper or in letters, because the President would make better decisions, if he would receive good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Waitys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tell Trump, supervised to monitor its media.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps relation to television lasts for decades - and now where he is in the White House, its TV advertising is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"if the candidate was offended because of unfair coverage, it was productive to show him that he received a fair coverage of places that were to persuade," said the former election campaign Sam Nunberg in February against political.</seg>
<seg id="1399">Political icos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key, Trumps Twitter custom in control, according to six former election campaign officials will ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise."</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps Twitter custom is ever "under control," is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps this campaigns have something to know what we don't know - that Trumps Tweets contain any more combustible material without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We probably will never know about the tweets that the Trump did not broadcast.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his collaborators have made it more many times, trouble from him, then their effort was worth the effort.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently prevent that Trump logs out.</seg>
<seg id="1406">A part of the problem exists that people at a White House, which emerges from competing parties, always trying to present their own agenda by promoting trump material, which may possibly support their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Politico - totally with this story - reported in May about the preference of adviser to bring President of strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former trump officials say that Trump like to react on negative press parts, especially those with damaged Lecks, and that he could find out how these come from.</seg>
<seg id="1410">Exactly this happened at the end of February, when somebody accused the president of a article from GotNews.com, the website of the Internet Provokateurs Charles C. Johnson, who accused the Deputy Prime Minister Katie Walsh, "the source behind one troop of Lecks" at the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson was banned from Twitter, or that he has offered no concrete evidence, or that he is expressed in the past false allegations, and to revoke her.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and began to ask staff of Walsh. "</seg>
<seg id="1413">Goldmacher added that the former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter, "tries to implement a system to manage and document the Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did it work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove more effective than primitive manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and its advisors still continues to influence.</seg>

<seg id="1480">In the Russian Affair by US President Donald Trump is alleged to have a special Jury called Robert Mueller after a review of a so-called Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1481">In the past few weeks the board enrolled in the past few weeks wrote the "Wall Street Journal" which trusted in the cause of confidential.</seg>
<seg id="1482">The newspaper evaluated the step as a sign that Mueller has expanded its investigations and intensified.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The CNN Transmitter reported that, in connection with a meeting between Trumps's eldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>

<seg id="1485">Mueller examines whether there were abortions between Trumps electoral team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">In the focus of the investigation, several men are to stand in the election campaign as an advisor of the republicans.</seg>
<seg id="1487">According to report, Mueller also grew more and more Trumps private and business environment among the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"" "the" "" "Washington Post" "" "wrote some weeks ago that the special-mediator trump personally put into the centre and submit it to the advance, whether the President may have handicapped the judiciary in the course of the affair." ""</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Lawys is to check this evidence in possible failures and decide whether the charge should be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand Lawys will therefore also be called.</seg>
<seg id="1491">Mostly they are turned on if it is larger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">Furthermore, the board can also be turned on by public prosecutor to invite people to the hearing of Eid.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to the CNN transmitter, pre-charges were exhibited in order to turn the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">Persons who were involved in the meeting are subject to a statement in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">You should also serve documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Besides Trump Jr. there were also Trumps Consultant and law-in-law Jared Kushner as well as his damaging election campaign Paul Manafort.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Right-wing doctors said on Thursday evening in the US television that the goal show that Mueller is not intimidated in his work, and that it should be necessary to take action quickly.</seg>
<seg id="1499">But it must not necessarily call that the Grand Jury will be on the end to decide on the survey of an indictment.</seg>
<seg id="1500">However, the implementation of the committee on the start of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason to concern the concern for President Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1501">In the midst of the new revelations, the President on Thursday evening received a speech in West Virginia to present the Russia affair as campaign of his political opponents.</seg>
<seg id="1502">"" "" "" "the Russia's history is a total invention," "" "said Trump." ""</seg>

<seg id="1505">But these work is usually in secret, he stressed.</seg>
<seg id="1506">The White House advocates any measures to accelerated the work of the special issue in "fair" manner.</seg>
<seg id="1507">The former FBI boss James Comey has said three times that he could not be determined by the president.</seg>
<seg id="1508">We have no reason to accept that something changed, it's stated in the declaration.</seg>
<seg id="1509">However, Mueller was only used after Trump Comey had been fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Because of this reinforces, pre-allegations had become petitively, he had to intervenous the judiciary.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Comey said in June before a Senate Committee, Trump have asked him about a setting of investigations against the then national security consultant Michael Flynn.</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president stands for investigation under pressure.</seg>
<seg id="1513">According to the US media, the White House has collected materials against the Sondererancellor and his staff.</seg>
<seg id="1514">This disbanded speculations about whether Trump Mueller put away.</seg>
<seg id="1515">Other than an independent special counsel of the congress, as in the Watergate affair around the later recalled President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could be fired by the President of the Ministry of Justice.</seg>

<seg id="1521">The more than a trillion tonnes heavy and 5800 square kilometer large Koloss toss now to the north and will need to be two, three years until it is melted.</seg>
<seg id="1522">With a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometers, the researchers have registered in the last three decades.</seg>
<seg id="1523">There is no danger for human beings from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">To what extent the climate change played a role in the demolition of the ice age, after research the information is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1525">A total of 30 years, however, there has been a series of unusual crumps in the region, writes the US research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a fact.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, the global warming could be associated with global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The broken colossus had so far been part of Larsen-C-Schelfeis.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Shelfeis floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It is thus growing steadily into the sea and breaks out regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America at the top of the antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this shelbow was the balance of waxing and breaking off some years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A complete scraper is broken there, writes AWI-researcher Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There is quite a lot to say that the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is in danger, because the front edge has never withdrawn so far as currently.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Moreover, the ice plate stand under voltage and can be broken in case of a piece of keys.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of shelfeis and iceberg increases the level above sea level, as they swim in the water and pushes much water as it yields even after the melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the seshoe leads the glaciers directly to the sea and can run much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">It could possibly increase the sea level, but only in the low degree, the British research project for the observation of Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">According to AWI, the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is the fourth largest Schelfeis of Antarctica, with nearly 50 000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the junction from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, on the front edge to the free ocean some 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it starts regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural occurrence and has no direct connection to climate change, the ice plate has now come into a endangering position," said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University.</seg>
<seg id="1542">"this is the most broadest retreat since the beginning of the record," he confirmed it.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Under scientists it is controversial if the Larsen-C-Shelfeis now grow back and possibly merge, his colleague Adrian Luckman and added: "our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development may last decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even if this researchers have caused the demolition of this gigantic iron ore not to climate change, so the Antarctic Peninsula have fallen in recent decades.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long stop of Antarctica extends towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to data of the research programme British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula have declined by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The increase in temperature increase has contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">The Antarctic Peninsula have in the past 50 years, warmed around three degrees and tell the areas where the temperature in the fastest pit.</seg>

<seg id="1797">The lavender is due to the recalling conditions and because of the diseases of the insects, which are transferred to insects, scientists and farmers who try to find solutions that are great headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, expert of the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "the Lavendel in Provence is effective, because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change, which has brought much less rain over the past years, and in autumn much more.</seg>

<seg id="1810">The employees of the weekly newspaper Riodoce meet for their plans to review their plans for the most recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by the organized crime, corrupt civil servants and unrivalled drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of her own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">It was told them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-ranking journalists discuss what safer feels: they will take their children to the office, which were to leave the goal of a attack with grenades, or they leave home in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words at a panel on the front of the room: opponent, neutral, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporter to propose a name for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and abdominal feel.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are Drug Aduggling, politicians, businessmen, journalists, the suspected of the government or cartels, a catalogue of criminals, which make the chaos of Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no resting period of violence, and while in the whole country the corpses are multiplied. 589 have since President Enrique Pena Nieto on December 2012. 589 stand after attacks and threats under federal cover and until now there was at least seven deaths in seven countries.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter, their editors and their inspiration from Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas, is among the latter.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the biggest mistakes is to live in Mexico and journalist," wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1820">His lack is felt deep, although its presence is available everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, that portrays his middle-finger with the word "Justice" on the facade of the riodoce building. two reporters in the 1930's, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, carry T-shirts to show its smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop will take place less than two months after his death and the reporter discuss their shared issues, the trauma, its nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Even though 2010 a special agreement was established in 2010 to edit the cases of journalists, according to the committee for the protection of journalists only two criminal proceedings filed.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most thousands of Morden, which are associated with drug trafficking, and organized crimes every year, the murderer of journalists will only be tried.</seg>
<seg id="1824">With Riodoce they still exist to treat the violence of Sinaloa while they are uncomforted and even though the Terrain is still availible.</seg>

<seg id="1828">On the morning of 15 May, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the state capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He only managed to drive a couple of blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was forced out by two men. he was forced out of his car and was probably translated into him for 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper, which is translated with "12th river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The scorer went away in his car and damaged it near.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two grown-up children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly into Culiacan free.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But there are practically nothing in silence on the subject of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzmans's arrest, last year, and extradition to the United States in January was Sinaloa to one of the most bloody battlefield of the country, since riving fractions come here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or more people shot on the road or that the cemetery is full of it, two-story moleen for drug may, which are larger than many houses for the Living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of the "peace" when only one cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable harbours and drugs trading in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, was broken down with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstanding contributed to the murder.</seg>

<seg id="1841">This publication is able to offend the sons, who bought the members bought any copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper kiosk.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second fault was in it, Valdez no force to force, after the confiscation of another newspaper, which had published the same story to leave the country for his own safety.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He survived so long that his friends and colleagues would have heard that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He was in 2003 as an experienced reporter for Noroeste, when he joined Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars to the founding of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars.</seg>

<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee on the Protection of Journalists for his courage in pursuit of the Mexican drug history, where they also led them.</seg>

<seg id="1868">The old rules, such as he and others, are not in Sinaloa no more - just like in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, in which a toxic mixture of lucrative dirt, weak institutions and corrupt government officials.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape changes continuously.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where the employees met by Riodoce to security training, there were suddenly no mobile phones. days earlier has been known that Spyware, exclusively sold to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside these two policemen sought protection against the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a middle class quarter of Culiacan.</seg>

<seg id="1874">It is months ago, since the reporter have gone into the mountain landscape, where the drug sails de facto stand under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the edition of this week, Riodoce has surrendered to three principal stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>

<seg id="1878">And there was a group that led in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official saying about it, who was kidnapped or how it was done, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite local call for drug retailers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant has been registered under the name of a politician, who ruled the reign of an Institutional Revolution Party (pri), which ruled almost the whole century all political levels.</seg>

<seg id="1885">"now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">The office of Valdez was devoted to the storage space for signs and stickers that protest against the Morde of journalists, because workers had never expected to have something unexpected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez snapped a few signs and went next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist for the office of the State Conservatory.</seg>

<seg id="1892">In a meeting with Governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to express journalists and destroy them, because they have said the truth.</seg>

<seg id="1937">Researchers have found that this plant hernivores, although it is covered with a armor, probably resembles a wall-changing tank, probably by the carnivorous dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The strongly sealed dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide themselves before smokers, and used a shielding technology that is used as counterfatting, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have been allowed to avoid better in its surroundings and to expand his enemies, experts, what indicates that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the family of Nodosaurier, made headlines for the first time in May, is now visible at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild beast and named Borealopelta markmitchelli at the Museumstechniker Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent more than 7.000 hours to cover it carefully.</seg>

<seg id="1943">They discovered the conforming, a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom, meaning that the tip of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the constants are common, the results are surprising because the size of Borealopelta exceeds the living animals today.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that the dinosaurs of dinosaurs was chased out of plenty of pressure through the nressful dinosaurs, that evolution the confrontation of the confrontation as means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals, which are using the constants - think of toe, zebra, or belt-animals - are much smaller and infrinous than spoils, what signalizes that this nodosaurier was exposed to a real fight.</seg>

<seg id="2019">How a activists came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">Brittany Ferrell was shaken at the core on 9 August 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Just one day after she arrived in New York City, sitting in St. Louis, sitting on the bed of an Airbnb apartment, which they rented and scrollout through Facebook on their phone.</seg>
<seg id="2022">You are proud of a post by somebody from High School.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"" "" "" "the police have just killed a 18 year old child and still on the road" "", "she was called there." ""</seg>
<seg id="2024">Confused, since no one had posted the information on their feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was continually prayed in their timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The Rapper from the territory of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, who was killed by a white police officers in Ferguson, Mo., to be killed live.</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of Browns leblosem body, stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"that's wild," I thought Ferrell. "</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was not new for them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">You put your mobile phone later in order to return to tweets on the Canfield-Drive later in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There were photos of police tape and people, crying, and of a man who claimed to be Browns Father who had a shield with the inscription: "Fergusons Police has just killed my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">She observed a live feed when a policeman stood before a group of demonstrators with a belline dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">In another video, she said, secured another policeman and cried out, "I will all kill you..." animals all kill. "</seg>
<seg id="2034">"that is not common," Ferrell reminded her statement.</seg>
<seg id="2035">"that is not the kind of murder that we are reconciled to us and we are able to name it."</seg>
<seg id="2036">At this moment I felt densely frost.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">You booked a return flight and went home next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After landing at 23 o'clock, she secured their 6 year old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the topic of a new documentary movie, "Whose Streets?" in the cinemas from the 11.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a history of survival and loss, the strength and loss of resistance, which consists of the perspective of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">When Ferrell went with her daughter, which brought a flower dress and a matching crown after Ferguson, the two one conversation, which they had countless times before this morning "about the black experience and the black condition."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"" "" "" "thou reminded you, as I taught you when black people must fight for it, what they believe?" "" "she remembered what she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2044">"we now go to Ferguson because the police had killed an 18-year-old boy, and that was not right.</seg>
<seg id="2045">I could not bring her away, "said Ferrell.</seg>
<seg id="2046">"what happens today is a highlight of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">You must know it and get it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">It must be well developed, not only activism and organization but also know the various layers of the black experience and the black Constitution and what we must do to free to free ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Even if I have lucky enough to give you a experience, in which she personally experienced no eclatant racism, it is not different than the next black women child.</seg>
<seg id="2050">I have the feeling I would give you a bad service to keep them away. "</seg>
<seg id="2051">The first stop when they arrived in Ferguson, located at the South Florissant Road, a location opposite the Police Authority, which became a campground as the activists on the possible non-indictment by Officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There, Ferrell and her daughter have joined together with a local business owner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags and helped to pass away to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly began to take a new type of activism for ferrell shape.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism has changed after August 9th, totally changed," said she and notices that she was a student at the University of Missouri. St. Louis president of the Minority Student Nurse Association and focused on Essential justice and health inequalities in black congregations.</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It has come all. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later, Ferrell met at Sabaah Folayan evening, a co-director of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2059">Folayan said she and her cinematographer Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to be only "documented" what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">A question came Ferrell in the sense: "you want to document or try to find a story that you can exploit?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">This Skepticsis was nourished through countless cases of people, often by White - in a community that benefited from their pain and its resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2062">As follows recently in an interview: "we had heard that people who were born in Ferguson and grew up, their voices were not centred, and we wanted to make it different."</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan had already been working with the then Co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area, who is known for his activism rum around the death of death.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His commitment brought the project closer together with six other native locals, together with six other native locals, followed by "Whose Streets?" in the years after Browns's shot.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary isn't someone who speaks to us or talk with us. we speak," said Davis.</seg>
<seg id="2066">"" "" "" "that was the main thing for me as these people will be displayed, because I will be represented." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2067">The goal was not to focus on Ferrells experience - to show that there is not a Messiah leaders, but to participate in a community, "said Folayan - she proved to be the most obvious participant of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2068">Therefore, documents of "Whose Streets?" surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrells life, as she loves himself and marries her wife.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"" "" "" "I felt like naked," "" "said Ferrell and laughed when they saw the ready product for the first time." ""</seg>
<seg id="2070">"" "" "" "but I understood that there must be certain danger during this work and in the human being of the black people." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferrells's history is repeating the role of the black pregnant women in the wider Black-Lives movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founder of the movement, who led the film "BlacklivesMatter" in the social media in 2012, identifies the film "BlacklivesMatter" in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, Swabule women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are struggling with different fronts.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Black, pregnant women have to wear the main load of all. "</seg>
<seg id="2075">"" "Folayan voted to note that" "" "the movement really is maintained by black women and many black women." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2076">However, it insisted that "this is not a" mative type of action "when Ferrell was selected as the heart of the film by Ferrell.</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who pushed these energy," she said.</seg>
<seg id="2078">"" "" "" "it's no coincidence, although it was at the forefront front because there was a black, pregnant woman as much in the game." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel your energy by screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">Meanwhile, the telecommunications line in Ferguson has long gone, but remains the rassal connections between the church and the police remains.</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on probation for 2 ½ years due to the blocking of a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the social atmosphere of the area, which she calls her home: "a chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">Nevertheless she turns to a singing and she feels wonderful to this memory, since they went on road three years ago in Ferguson.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"it is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We must love one another and support.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">From "dream" to "size network": TV-reader discuss bits in bit</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit Gallery moved the people, although they are not yet built long.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre on the southern end of the pedestrian zone has been obsolete since the first presentation in 2009, the population in advocate and opponents.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The topic is hardly a cold.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg" on our Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="2093">During one bit of the bit Gallery: "it would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "This would be real-class" (Nicole Grasten), comes from the other side: "does not need a man" (Siggi BNR) or quite simple: "size wintering!" (Lars Scholz).</seg>
<seg id="2094">While the advocate insisted that a gallery attracts more customers to the city, of which the other business also benefit, the adversaries will fear that then the pedestrian zone is furthered.</seg>
<seg id="2095">In addition, the gallery is planned on the property, on which the peasant market hall stands, where 13 guides will offer their products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">It will end with the start of construction.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The gallery Macher want to integrate a market hall in the new building - as a Beda Square, with possibility of sitting outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone: "we've been selling almost weekly in the peasant market for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cake of the virgins are always very happy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">We also have discovered the butcher for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would wish that during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">There are also other cities in other cities.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "whether direct marketed in a market hall in the gallery, comes to the amount of rent.</seg>
<seg id="2105">"" "the new project is probably not just low." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "what is the shopping mall in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">Whether Clothing, shoes, drills or supermarkets: I find the superfluous.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Of which there are enough in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">But there is not even a regular weekly market still, it is so important that at least the market hall remains.</seg>
<seg id="2111">For after all, the goods offered there is fresh, mainly by the supplier, and is pure cheap.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As you can see, shop-shops in a shopping centre can only be rented from bigger firms, because they are often not portable for a single retailer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">A pity, special shops are almost no longer and what remains of it, then probably vanish. "</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: 'a shopping mall with a market hall does not fit for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery doesn't work to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Above all: where is the peasant market hall during the construction time?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old EDEKA would be the solution - even on duration when the bit of the bit actually comes down.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or creates the bit-bit Gallery before, to drive all shops from Bitburg? "</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "that's not easy to work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">And shopping center, which is empty, no one needs.</seg>
<seg id="2121">Because of my view it would have been better to promote a real peasant market instead of this gallery.</seg>
<seg id="2122">But for a peasant market hall, thanks to the mad many - how I find - senseless construction projects in Bitburg no more space.</seg>
<seg id="2123">When the peasant market hall will be removed, a piece of culture will disappear. "</seg>
<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannering DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the room of Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces are visible - white, black and brown, which are almost unreadable - which hang on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupur and Haarlem, which were sent from Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent out the excerpts from the prison Fort Leavenworth, where former secret service analytics found a 35-year-old prison after she made diplomatic notifications about the Wiki website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition, which was opened on 2 August, is a Becoming Resemblance (a matching similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">It is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose disciplines have been transformed into its expertise in technology, computer science and art, and maning, whose conviction was converted to Barack Obama only three days in his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg has created through the algorithm analysis of the DNA which could look like any intellectual comment on how to interpret these genomic data - the many wise men how they can interpret and created the inherent Determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, which was born as Bradley Edward, has already been talking about the identification as a woman, was sentenced in 2013 for 20 charges, including six clashes against the SpionageAct, computer was and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">By the prison, its picture was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo taken - a grained, black-white Selfie, in the maning near a driver's seat and carries a platelblonde permeability - with which it was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg returned from the great success of their 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">It produced the artist portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts, like cigarette dumb and chewing gum, using the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of what people might look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they led an interview with Chelsea Manning, while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," declared Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not visit this time and could not be photographed, therefore, they took contact with Chelsea and asked them whether they wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her incarcerated Muse were forced to unobsate bricks which had fished several letters over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even illustrate one of Shoili Kanungo illustrated comic "Supplied images," which would be a future foreseen, in which the president elbows would convert and would be able to see the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama actually was actually a few days after the book was published, manings release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome way of lucky event.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also now at the opening of the exhibition some depth and Starkes, since Donald Trump leads a war against informant from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweetable paths to fix the rigid boilers, which it should actually fix.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked after the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen from a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In one on the wall of the gallery, Manning called for her oversized signature among them (the "i" in her family name is equipped with a heart) an end of "automatic collapse, their foundation sex, race, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousands of Cs and Gs and As described in a pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg trusted, through the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotide after the highly developed scientific Lexicon of the artist), as amazing similar, at least in biological regard, we all are.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"" "" "" "what people are hopefully will take care of us, who we are, and how openly genetic data for a interpretation and how subjective they are" "" "said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works from 2007, Spurious memories, too can be seen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA dates can tell so many different stories, therefore the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a separate room, is one side from the above mentioned comic-novelle.</seg>
<seg id="2149">She shows Manning, as it comes with a hands-free spins in the hand of the disciplines of the United States as King Kong.</seg>

<seg id="2153">"I still get geese when I speak about it."</seg>
<seg id="2154">Manning has not yet seen the exhibition nor seen in the comic book - but when it was expected to do it, then it will be greeted in the middle of the room of masks, from their own genomic simulation, which are summarized as hordes of Protestants.</seg>

<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant-chain with more than 25.000 employees and over 500 locations, Convercent has been used for over one year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures, and have a simple opportunity to reach their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Before, when a clerk wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a telephone number or email for the company headquarters, a formal complaint and hope that he was serious.</seg>

<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance that takes the approval of Venture Capital Investors who have both start-ups.</seg>

<seg id="2291">In his younger past, the small Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze-music video and was a hatch for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970-he and 1980-s.</seg>
<seg id="2292">But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history of his cozy sitting in the valley of Kent and now is now for inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaarii Yorkshireman, with a great love for historical documents.</seg>

<seg id="2295">'A Castle in England plays the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documented the families who lived in Scotney. each history was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.</seg>
<seg id="2296">It is not the first book of Rhodes, which is based on an archive: he wrote in 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection that was inspired by documents in British Library - a project that he was unexpected.</seg>

<seg id="2392">Recently the Foundation published for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for Responsible Robotics) (FRR) initiated a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we must start to take their ascension.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eyelash of the robot, its form of nipple and type of fingernagel choose.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"" "" "" "people are fun on them, but the company also supply lots of it, and we will still be able to see it more frequently." "" "lord Sharkey said with the publication of his new report." ""</seg>

<seg id="2397">The user may also customize his robot also to its beliefs "and do all of them choose from the eye-color of the robot through the shape of the nipple to the type or the color of his fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2398">But it is still troubled because many robots have the "personalities" which would look like a Stepford-Woman Progressive.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern soluppen have developed to robots with a Silicon foreskin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotix robot makes it possible to adapt their users to adapt their robots to the properties which can be appealing like relapty.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there are still the Roxxxy Gold sex robot with preprogrammed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah," which gives the impression of relapse and "Wild Wendy" with a "adventurous" personality.</seg>

<seg id="2404">In the course of the day, she also has its mood - all like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">It can be tired to be fixed on counter or it can be "in mood!"</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many troubled aspects on this ascent of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships, but the inferior female properties that calls a step on Frigid (it is here: irresistible) Farrah, but troubled one most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his site True Companion Roxxxy is used with a vibrator but for males.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) have a vibrator, why can men then have no Roxxxy?" it is called on the site.</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not only a fetish or just just another sex lighter.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their birth and their increasing refinement point in a little darker and deeper understanding in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal degree of Gender Equality to a desire after sex with subjugation as optional encore.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men are going to hold no sex robots, and during the FRR your rising popularity remain, however, they still remain on the edge of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what leaketh out of the boundary zones, in regards to the spirit of time, in which we live, very instructive.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strangely or belongated, until they are the free market for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain overcutting that these highly developed sex robots are threatened with a time in which the rights of women are threatened worldwide, in which the White House gives a presidents whom women have failed to attack women.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most dreadful aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the handmaid ') are not the graphic images that have been swallowed up and the cast eyes, but as realistic these vision.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The republic of Gilead is a jump but at the moment it does not feel like a big jump.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind this sex robot is to produce a physical similarity to real women as realistic as technically possible (if also with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want to feel deserted that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">But, in the point, when it comes to their "personalities," robots no real women represent.</seg>

<seg id="2424">Trumps great performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney to the treatment of healthy lives</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a Binsenfeishlist of the Trump era, that the political shifts, which have the U.S. electorate, also have divided families in small format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Erntedankle there were newspapers in the US newspapers and suggestions about how to deal with the Horror of Trump.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We destroy all the supposedly to make our filter bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="2429">It has been noted less, the power Trumps, families.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I chose this because my cousin, a left-oriented Dichterin, who lives in Chicago, long since long with the Republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">It recalled me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House, everyone who knows them, including the republican relationship with which it fought for decades because of politics, suddenly and quite independent on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">In order to make the dining table this certainly is a good thing but it falls in a further context that this also brings significant risks with oneself.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The lens was strengthened by trump, but the issuing effect of his presidency has the power to push us all by the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">When we speak of "Normalisation" and Trump, we refer to the best way that his bib will not be phased out of a day.</seg>
<seg id="2436">However, there is still a more terrifying long-term scenario, in the Trump Republicans of the right wing "normalizes" which suddenly appeared in a comparison to his standards, suddenly as an understanding of understanding.</seg>
<seg id="2437">I find me today of an active nostalgic for Mitt Romney's comic version of the insurrection - the dog on the Autodach, which saw 14% income tax (but at least did we know like his tax return) - both in comparison to Trump in fact a very mild criminal offences.</seg>

<seg id="2443">The Central Park Karousel is still a strange magical experience, as here two years old, an 11-year-old and two women in the 40-th years can go on it and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">When I could rate the carousel I would have given to him the full score, but fortunately no one has asked them.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was forced to rate my "experience" with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to pay with a 15% tip of tipping - this to buy a little over the shop.</seg>

<seg id="2579">Red meat, milk products and chocolate could help IBD (inflammatory intestinal disease)</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could linking the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition that affects approximately 1.3 million and in Great Britain 300,000, causes magnets and flaps, recurring or bloody fights, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While those affected is usually advised to alleviate flesh and milk products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers found at the Washington University that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins, enhancing immune cells, promote a tolerant gut.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The conductive researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immuncells in the intestinal routers to ensure that harmful microbes to hide themselves in food, not penetrating in the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are able to resolve inflammation, are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive fabric.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the balance is too far in direction of inflammation, it can result in a inflammatory intestinal disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments it was found that a kind of tolerance conveyance immune cell in mice comes to carry out a certain bacterium in its bowels.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to resolve the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between a bacteria-art - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbioma, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance, manufactured.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan had the mice in their food, the more had they from these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He pointed out that the combination of L. reuteri and one of tryptophan rich nutrition tolerated, less inflammatory boathus promotes if the same system is effective in humans.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The Postdoctorship in Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan, sought out a kind of immune cell that had been promoting tolerance when she found that a group of study mice had such cells, but a different group of the same tribe, but it had not been separated.</seg>
<seg id="2593">You thought that the difference with the intestinal microbids of mice had to do - the fellowship of bacteria, viruses and fungi that usually live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The mice of the mice were DNA sequenzes and there were six bacterias, which were present in mice with immune cells, but without having missing in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were detected in a sterile environment, so that they had not developed a intestinal microbiome and developed this kind of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">To understand how the bacteria rise to the immune system, researchers left L. reuteri in a liquid and then overled small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells, which were isolated from mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">Immuncells developed to tolerable cells of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">As the active component of the fluid was cleaned, it proved to be a side product of the tryptophan Metabolism, known as Indol-3-milactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">When researchers saw the amount of tryptophan in the feed of mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan decreased, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan declared that people have the same tolerable carriers such as mice, and that most of us L. reuteri protect us from our gastrointestines.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether Tryptophan-side-products from L. reuteri the cells of people develop such as mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory intestinal disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">She said, "The development of these cells probably is something that we want to promote, since these cells control inflammation on the inside surface of the gut.</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentials can lead high tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri to a extension of this population. "</seg>

<seg id="2716">The green white Sikorsky VH-3D known as Marine One, when the President is on board, was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American programmes.</seg>
<seg id="2717">President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and Managing Director of the White House made a tour of all 50 states.</seg>
<seg id="2718">The helicopter was built in Connecticut with a yacht from Maine, a fire engine from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="2719">The Military Office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter order or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter in the South Lawn, following the records of Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMx-1), the unit that is responsible for the operation of the helicopter.</seg>
<seg id="2720">"" "" "" "I just wanted to be aware, because it is an unusual event with great visibility," "" "wrote the Commanger of HMx-1 on the eve of the event, the Deputy Military Tribunal for aviation." ""</seg>
<seg id="2721">The message showed that the helicopter arrived at the South Lawn at 7 o'clock in the morning at the South Lawn for the event at 15 o'clock, and so long stayed until the lawn was cleared between 18: 00 and 21: 00 in this evening.</seg>
<seg id="2722">Note that if the departure from the White House should be delayed, due to the limitation of service hours a second crew would be needed for return flight.</seg>
<seg id="2723">During the event, the original aircrew was located during the helicopter while the security staff remained at the plane during the time on the plane.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Out of the TIME's provided recordings did not clearly see whether a second flight crew was required.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Hatch Act prohibits state-state property for political purposes.</seg>
<seg id="2726">Records indicate that HMx-1 has asked if the event might violate the determination.</seg>
<seg id="2727">"a question that we asked if it was a violation of the Hatch acts and we were informed that this was not the case," wrote the Commander.</seg>
<seg id="2728">"sounds like if you are shut up," said the Deputy Commander.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The event "Made in America" was designated by the White House as an official event and would not be covered by the Hatch Act.</seg>
<seg id="2730">But official events also have political issues.</seg>
<seg id="2731">At the event, the President gave a impetus to reform of health reform that was in the Senate in the Gange, and he propagated the efforts to shift the government provisions.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The use of the aircraft that is known as Marine One or Air Force One, is hardly a new phenomenon for political purposes.</seg>

<seg id="2742">A speaker of Sikorsky said that the company had not been involved in this helicopter in the South Lawn.</seg>
<seg id="2743">HMx-1 does not provide a budget drawing for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.</seg>

<seg id="2867">After the termination is Neymar to the most expensive player in the world and the most highly paid professional athletes of the world. PSG provides salaries of more than 500,000 GBP per week.</seg>
<seg id="2868">Barcelona is thinking about the way how Neymar has given its way to outside, although a source in the vicinity of the Catalan board insists that the club has always given its best to take care of him from Santos in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="2869">But the football world was warned about three years ago by the PSG president in front of this view?</seg>
<seg id="2870">When Manchester City 2014 was interested in the signing of Blaise Matuidi, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for each club, who wanted to sign one of the best players from PSG.</seg>

<seg id="2873">But if they try to sign one of our players at sign, it will have consequences. "</seg>
<seg id="2874">Barcelona seems to have exceeded this line, with the Spanish club's beginning of this summer interest in the PSG midfielder Marco Verratti.</seg>
<seg id="2875">PSG clearly did that it would not allow it to travel to the International of Italy in any circumstances and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by taking one of its price for Neymar.</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen report deburdened Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domenatzen report to the abuse of missiles Pope Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">The author of the author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the Missitchandal at the Regensburger Domenatzen continues for discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Prophets, spokesperson for the reformist movement "We are church," declared by the former Regensburger Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emerge Benedict XVI, a debt relief.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would be the appearance of the Catholic Church to serve when Mueller and Ratzinger would express their deepest regret for their own submissions or their time wrong evaluation of the processes.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"" "the Vatican Law" "" "Osservatore Romano," "" "however, criticised that by force on violence at the domain names" "" "two measures" "" "was measured." ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">As regards the interventions in Regensburg, no one would have to avoid "dirty and damage acts," the author of Lucetta Scaraffia, historians and member of the national Italian Bioethics Committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the attraction, the Catholic Church as a source of all evil, is already part of everyday experience and prepares the public opinion about that" "" "writes Scaraffia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">"" "also Prince of Thurn and taxis said in the interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk," "" "we are happy to go to the church." "" "we are happy to go up to the church." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2898">In addition, she pointed out that in their adolescence, they had been a completely normal pedagogical means, "in order to be done with kids, as I was one, ready to be finished."</seg>
<seg id="2899">They are unfair, present benchmarks for earlier decades, because the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports about the abuse of abuse often also Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Entirely at wrong, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who was written with Ratzinger to memorandum the book "My brother of the Pope" (translated into 12 languages).</seg>
<seg id="2902">"" "" "" "I have to take Georg Ratzinger," "", "says Eemann," "" "for all that had nothing to do with him," "" "he evaluates the results of the final report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report, written by the diocese Regensburg with the Enlightenment lawyer Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">A total of 547 Regensburger Domenatzen were killed between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s "with high plausibility" victims of overtook, 67 domain names sexually abused.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report, it was said to Georg Ratzinger, who was active from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg: "briefly, it can hold that by Domkapellmeister R. in many cases, forms of physical and psychic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2906">The punishment for pupils could even be severe even at a high level of motivating.</seg>
<seg id="2907">In contrast to numerous other charges, many victims were estimating the general humanity of R. estimonials and therefore in numerous cases even positive memories with him. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview Eemann, why the final report on the Missitchsskandal at the Regensburger domain Georg Ratzinger went to the opinion of his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Eemann, the 440-page report on the "incidents of nonviolence at the Regensburger Domenatzen," a contradictory image of Domenellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">"" "for one lifting many students" "" "out of humanity" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, it appears as Choleriker and perfectionist, which became the eye-softwist when a domain kit brought no top performance.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you consider as his biographer this final report?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if one read the effort and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask, why the name Georg Ratzinger is at all at all.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Just eight pages dedicated to him and it is markedly acquitted of every suspicion of the mediation or forage in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The violence at the pre-school had occurred outside of its efficiencies.</seg>
<seg id="2916">One can refuse to him if it was too late or first clarifies it not serious enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">The grammar school, which he worked, was published by practically all respondents as - as literally - "salvation," the heaven "and" better world. "</seg>
<seg id="2918">So the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger is a very excellent witness, describes him as a "warm", very popular "and" comprehensible, "as an extremely reliable teacher who provided the guys regularly with cakes, biscuits and Bonbons, and from grapes of children.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Merely a minority is complained about his perfectionism and his high-motionality that led even to Wutouchen.</seg>
<seg id="2920">That he did not only threw himself with chairs and the key and on the ground, but also earching guys in the hair or ears, he has already given himself a few years ago, deeply regretted and excused for this.</seg>
<seg id="2921">However, in his honour, it must be said that such educators in the unquestioned time, the 1960s and 1970s, were widespread, with parents as in teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you still know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everybody was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also have experienced that in a world school, one state grammar school.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared with what it is actually in this report, namely the terrible sexual abuse and violence at the school, the freillet Bagatellen are.</seg>
<seg id="2926">Since you're asking himself to do not with his acquaintness and his role as the brother of Benedict XVI, many media had gone down on him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">The Bavarian Pope himself, as many as they never understood him, are still increasingly jealous.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In connection with the report much about the topic of abuse at the Regensburger Domenatzen station was reported in connection with the report.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger is going to report any failure or a visit with regard to sexual abuse on the burden of sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: very clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of the 67 victims of sexual assorations claims to have committed themselves to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were inaugurated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I never saw me to speak with my father or my mother," "" "said an interested representative for the others," It was me all very embarrassing. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2935">The true problem during the Enlightenment of sexual abuse, and is that most victims were silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they did not commit their parents and siblings, then definitely not for a choir leader, however, certainly would have been a colleague of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do I evaluate the Ratzinger's Ratzinger's role in terms of abuse of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questioned student he formulated this: "regarding sexual abuse... see I... no case, in which he reckoned (Georg Ratzinger) timely perceive and could have been able to stop their perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I think it... also for truly absurd that it is expected to take him... Buben in urgent or clearer or even rather opened, as compared to their parents, Internatsleitern, Confidentists, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That man speaks with him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">Thus the report comes to the very clear result: "that in the lead to affected pupils and / or whose environment, in the context of the investigation, could not be confirmed."</seg>
<seg id="2942">For sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is free from everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2943">So it cannot be accused him that prevents it from or to display it.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore no reason to bring his good name to these resistors, as it was in some cases, unfortunately.</seg>
<seg id="2945">In the media was a lot of "nonviolence" at the Regensburger Domenatzen. "</seg>
<seg id="2946">The previous report of Domenellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused of his report.</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this approach?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that in the coverage everything was mixed and scoring in a huge melange from sexual abuse and violence and somewhere in the middle of that, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But just that is a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">There will be clean separately: between the school and the high school of the domain, between sexual abuse and violence, we say once, other preference.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Moreover, the report deals from the time since 1945, so also from four decades, Georg Ratzinger is not a choir director of the domain name.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole terrible test pedagogy, the cases, in which boys had been irrelevant and painstakingly, and among them had been horrified, took all at the school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where people have to have reigns.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with whom, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boys only on the face when they were already at the domain of the cathedral.</seg>
<seg id="2954">On what was the very most witnesses, the subject "Preschool" taboo.</seg>
<seg id="2955">There was only happy to be escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paraean" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different from the grammar school?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: since there was no discipline, but no sawn violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, at which the report comes to the conclusion that "many victims were estimating the general humanity of R. (and therefore in numerous cases even positive memories with him."</seg>
<seg id="2959">As a result, the design remains, to have taken away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report was only definitized only two time periods, in which it was reported by states on the pre-school.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish himself and from their predecessors at a school, which he didn't worked and responsible, (so the witness) wanted nothing to hear, and then again around 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">For Georg Ratzinger, the ears consumed by Georg Ratzinger?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, since 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domasatzymnasium who even reproduced the report.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "this indicates that," "" "he will continue practiced the test penalty in the pre-school." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">Already in view of the risk of negative symptoms, he is urgent.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was, of course, as legal clarity when testing was long ago in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Prior to that, it occurred in a legal gray zone, as every one knows about us.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was difficult for him to estimate that the affected people might have been overpowered or dramatic, where the admissible limit was exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But it can't say too, he would have gone astroned.</seg>
<seg id="2970">That is just not right.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the test penalty was officially abolished in Bavaria in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Fürstin Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it is unfair to use today's pedagogical standards at the time of time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hesemann: we are talking about the "Fallstrick of Anachronism," thus the danger to evaluate the past in today's moral standards.</seg>
<seg id="2975">There is already right in the princess.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But, of course, not for sexual abuse, who was abhackable to all times, and not for what has been broken down in pre-school education and violence against innocent children's disease, which goes far beyond that time.</seg>
<seg id="2977">That is all awesome and I'm glad that it is finally ready to work.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I have to take Georg Ratzinger, because all that had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His funds for discipline and punishment, for higsaws and their ears were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment is forbidden, he has also been constricted.</seg>
<seg id="2981">What is the picture of his real time, Georg Ratzinger has been given to you for the book "My brother of the Pope"?</seg>
<seg id="2982">Came the theme test again to the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, tells of his perspective, as the domain atzen only played a side role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I did not forget that he led a rigorous regiment.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But also this has to be said: without these perfectionism, without the unconditional discipline, it would be hardly possible to form a institution of Weltrang, true culture ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition that went to tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With cookies and Bonbons alone, one does not make any big singer, and in front of every success, equal to which area, but always discipline, passion and self-flooded.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Than what people do you have experienced Georg Ratzinger at the talks about their books?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: I've met my work on the book and beyond that I've witnessed over wonderful, humorous, deep gbelievers and heart-good people, from which one could not imagine that he could do only a fly something.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I get regularly with, as many former domain names still today, 23 years after his retirement, regularly contact him to visit him. he is almost blind - and him as a member of her family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who are not forgiven to day until today, so that it was strictly strictly to them, are clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the domain names are thankful to him today that he enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that it is always a good, väterous teacher - a stringent father, fiss, that may be - but also a delightful respectful, to which they still looked up today and honour it.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And, please, once again: everything that you throws to him are Educational methods that were at the time at the time.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is highly unjust, a man just because he is prominently and one more prominent brother to make a medial sin-bock.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the evil intention that stands behind it only too obviously.</seg>
<seg id="2997">For the report which has just been published, relieve him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the anounding areas would have acquired a 93-year-old man who acquired great merits and without the outside of Bavaria and probably nobody wanted to know the Regensburger Domenatzen, finally in peace.</seg>
