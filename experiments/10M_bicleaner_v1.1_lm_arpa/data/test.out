&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have the desire to always be perfect and successfully . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

gol@@ fers Lan@@ ger receives the pyramid of pil@@ es
his experiences on the horse are super@@ se@@ eable .
at the end of a golf competition in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger sought a little variation with some colleagues with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 year old , it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; gold fisher@@ y pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes the horses struck the horses at its ceremony , they hunt for the fast Gal@@ lop in the home .
I had a kilometer at this pace , I have dre@@ amed .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger .
and so the horse arri@@ es already ended again .
on Saturday , the best gol@@ fer of all times - 101 tournament victories was again in the vicinity of horses .
he led himself with his family to the AL@@ RV site of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he would not go to photo album .
the first time in Aachen was the first time in Aachen and thus at CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sports assistance sur@@ passed the man from An@@ hausen in the context of a small gala the Golden Sport@@ pil@@ es .
at awards he doesn &apos;t charge the sympath@@ etic sports@@ men .
Bundes@@ con@@ scienti@@ ous Cross , Silver bay leaf , Champions Tour Player of the year ...
even the British Queen has already ad@@ owed it .
a long time is the 18th winner of the pyramid of pyr@@ am@@ ids .
in Aachen , he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means very much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for they will not only be awarded for spor@@ tive successes , but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lan@@ ger promotes the offspring in decades .
and so he also gave the prize money of EUR 25,000 .
with 15 other outstanding athletes , the two @-@ fold U.S. Champion won the &quot; Hall of Fame of German Sports . &quot;
among the names include the athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Rwand@@ an Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Rwand@@ an Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the position of Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the Spr@@ inkl@@ es Al@@ win Sho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um the hand of all Erhard wonderful .
many of these sports enthusiasts came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the lively society emigrated to the Spring@@ stadium where the Lav@@ az@@ za prize was running .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger maintained a distance to the large animals .
Clin@@ ics and Tr@@ um@@ ps Economic Policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
in infrastructure and prevent the T@@ TP trade agreement - we want both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
however , the two U.S. presidential compet@@ iti@@ ves are one of the tax and energy policies as well as in a basic question .
differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hill@@ ary Clinton are based on a fundamental , more philosoph@@ ical distinction .
the role of the role of the State .
Tr@@ ump wants to keep in doubt rather small and war@@ ns before , as the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regul@@ ators .
Clinton wanted to control the economy to death and regul@@ ate death , he says .
it himself would be different , claimed Tr@@ ump .
he will drive bul@@ ators massi@@ vely , and he makes himself strong tax reform with lower tax rates strongly - for individuals and businesses .
Clinton opposed it : the state has appointed certain tasks , he has dis@@ advant@@ age@@ ous chances to open and needs money .
therefore the tax for the we@@ al@@ rich would increase , says it .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic infrastructure .
to be invested in the need to say Tr@@ ump and Clinton almost immediately .
the democratic Candi@@ date announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes in the infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are rejected by the state @-@ critical Te@@ x @-@ wing of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
thus , at Tr@@ ump , we could get internal discussions .
more significant are the differences in energy and climate policies .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal plants and drive coal plants in the USA .
oil support is also possible to termin@@ ate in the Paris climate agreement as far as possible .
in contrast to its investment program , Clinton aims to strengthen and demands Renewable Energi@@ es : &quot; a country will make the super@@ power of a clean energies and create millions jobs . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only in the infrastructure - even with international trade agreement , both competitors are not far from each other .
T@@ PP , the ac@@ ia @-@ fish trading agreement , do not want to sign both .
at the same time , both parties don &apos;t want to isol@@ ate the USA from international trade , but just better protect American jobs .
they are then to be paid better , calls for Clinton .
the present minimum wage of 7,@@ 25 US dollars is a hunger strike .
he wants to raise it up to $ 15 per hour .
as if Tr@@ ump wants to do this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must be r@@ ushing , then he says he must not be changed .
however , the big discussion of the coming months should probably develop rather to develop the control policy of the two camps .
on the one hand stands Tr@@ ump , who wants to load the economy and the citizens to spur growth .
his critics kept him before , that the bud@@ get@@ ary deficit would only be bigger .
on the other hand Clinton , who want to ask at least from the we@@ al@@ om , wants to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not even the solution .
escape : &quot; any wing@@ ed woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone , almost as to everyday life .
if they come in Germany , they often are sad .
a house provides refuge .
in a large kitchen there are four females .
each has a baby , which is not a year old .
one has put her little son into his arm .
it rocks with big eyes ne@@ ug@@ ly in the room .
his mother rigid on the table top .
until they noticed that it is observed .
she sm@@ iled briefly , and kissed the little ones .
the scene works normal .
until one speaks with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
it is part of the Managing Director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a sponsor for Social Benef@@ it offers in Bavaria , and deals with the topic of women on the run .
four women in the kitchen are poultry .
they live in the north of Munich in one of the few de@@ centr@@ alised accommodations for all@@ round women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs made up the establishment together with Pro Familia and the Munich Frau@@ enh@@ ilfe .
it was officially opened officially .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there is no one - not as visitors too .
the exception is a watch@@ man before the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated to say : every woman who comes here , has done experiences with sexual violence , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee because they are polit@@ ically tra@@ cked because of them torture or death , or because their families send them as a hope to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she tells her . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among women , other reasons for escape : &quot; many steal away secretly , because they don &apos;t see any other way . &quot;
in their home they have experience with sexual violence , compul@@ sion , Hon@@ or , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
that drives them away .
on the run goes on .
&quot; tu@@ g for instance , for example a bottle of water require a sexual action , is no rarity , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who believe that the end , as soon as they are in Germany , ir@@ re , says B@@ ahr .
also here , all women in refugee groups would often be considered as min@@ ating and aw@@ ful if mis@@ chief .
this leads to the fact that approximately 90 percent of women who live in the north of Munich will be trau@@ mat@@ ised .
&quot; some of the children are not voluntary in favour . &quot;
many women are so usual that they say nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they did not trust to speak openly about the awak@@ ening , because the shame is too great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often have no help to help you need more accommodation only for them , requires B@@ ahr .
the seven District authorities are responsible for the placing of refugees in Bavaria .
on the question whether they w@@ asted from a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction area , answer some with no .
in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz region and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , there will be something that is not in sub@@ stitution for governments .
even in Schw@@ aben alone , women fled not separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press brie@@ cher of the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Central fran@@ ken is available in some community floors or own houses only for single @-@ standing women and their children .
the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations only for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rights of Women and Gender Equality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be separated from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a study published for the Committee , it says : &quot; it is very important that men and women will be home to them . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lack privacy or women and women are accommodated together , it can come to - persistent - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
above all , the shower room should be separately accessible and accessible for women , is in the study .
as much as the women experience this protection , you can read on the And@@ hr@@ ines that there is a house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since it has been talking about us , we have a long waiting list , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you could easily go into a second house .
assistant doctors strike : recei@@ v@@ ables according to new working measures
Deputy President of the Assist@@ ants have submitted their union to do new employment measures with their disp@@ utes regarding a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has claimed his entire Council as beginning of September more work measures .
the J@@ DC had said that it would have been Minister to worry about the wor@@ ries regarding the contract .
assistance and medical assist@@ ants have voted on agreement of a contract with the BM@@ A agreement with the BM@@ A agreement .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in the elections .
in a letter to the members who was published on Thursday evening on Twitter , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court , said that the government had remained calm , &quot; which resulted in the agreement that the Treaty was rejected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of which the J@@ DC management voted to re@@ ject the proposed new contract . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Board has set a formal decision on a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to start a running programme of es@@ cal@@ ating labor measures , starting in early September .
the disp@@ utes led by the assistance of assistance of this year six times , the first overall cases in the history of N@@ HS .
based on the election of the BM@@ A assistant , Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana , Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana , joined the agreed conclusion of the agreed conclusion , which were recommended by the BM@@ A .
he shared BM@@ A members during the meetings which took place before the vote by 54@@ .000 assistant doctors and medical students , that the contract should be advant@@ age@@ ous and accepted .
after the vote , the health minister Jeremy Hunt said that the Treaty for Doc@@ tors in England would be forced to be implemented .
Russia and Turkey : a &quot; alliance of Foreign Affairs &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce their hands and to the official end of the eight months of continuous war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin grants his Turkish counter@@ part in the gilded conference of St. Petersburg Pal@@ ast@@ es in the reception , I can not for@@ bid that Ankara wants to make them most reconciliation .
there was the hand , yes .
but Put@@ to the smile , nar@@ li@@ pp@@ le and he radi@@ ate barely warmth , even for its past conditions .
in contrast , Recep Tayyip Erd@@ og@@ an said to his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report of five times .
I could not count it anymore .
he also promised that relations with Russia could not only return to their old level before the crisis , but even better .
on the next day a newspaper described that Erd@@ og@@ an would have thought so much worse than ever happened .
my enthusiasm appeared to me rather the contrary .
but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ant , sustainable cooling showed that the Russian president of Russia had nothing forgotten .
rather , the cause of crisis was the first to mention in his actions : the shooting of a Russian fighter aircraft from the Syrian border crossing Turkey .
Moscow out of reaction at the time was wake @-@ fire .
Putin shared from and accused Ankara , to be in the back .
this was even bigger , since it was committed by a ver@@ itable friend .
the Vet@@ rop@@ es will be re@@ build again , if not impossible .
the public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the state controlled media led a strong , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
at one time , when the Turks would bear the iniquity of everything .
the serious acc@@ us@@ ation of senior officials were that Erd@@ og@@ an &apos;s own family had benef@@ ited from illegal oil trade in the areas of Syria , which was controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he has fought this v@@ eh@@ ement .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look at the front .
finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the exc@@ use of the President Erd@@ og@@ an who wanted to hear .
Russia was able to book a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the benefits of an arm@@ ist@@ ice is clear at hand .
Erd@@ og@@ an needs primarily with all friends who can get , after he has been dis@@ closed the last month with a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat of almost his ministry .
again , terror attacks on Turkey have also sh@@ aken him .
but there are also economical designs .
Russian sanctions enorm@@ ously hit Turkey - in particular the ban of char@@ ist who usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast .
the number of shares declined by almost 90 % .
in Russia , the tour operators and charter companies will be facilit@@ ated if the flights will be resum@@ ed again .
they count towards a late ais@@ onal sign in the Mediterranean .
this week , the state television set up fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are imported again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ st@@ i formulated it in the following way : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists long , tomatoes live here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is mad on the West , since it &apos;s reaction to the attempted power of power as a weak response .
to do this , the continued gro@@ ove of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ ping on it is to withdraw from cool mood and reduce the relationship between Turkey and the West .
in Ankara won a bonus for Ankara with security , that he asked for the attempted coup &apos; support for the selected state organs .
this is true for Moscow , a self @-@ understanding which itself has a pro@@ found fear of rain .
the summit in this gl@@ itter@@ ing palace in the sea made it possible Russia and Turkey , one , as it had described me a analy@@ st , &quot; Alliance of external sides &quot; : two countries which are cast away from the west and po@@ or@@ ly treated and feeling al@@ lied with .
nonetheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow had recently delivered the role as a peace camp , but Russia and Turkey support other matters .
it could be noted that after almost three hours they sang both President on the press conference that they would not have stopped the topic once again .
the President of Turkey ver@@ ed it to answer a question about its differences , while Putin decided to emphas@@ ise this .
there is no clear con@@ sens@@ us where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open host@@ ilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster , the NATO member Turkey sent the Russian mar@@ tial jet , it certainly is better that the two heads of heads are at least once again .
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside of Scotland no longer available
according to the Bank &apos;s board , the R@@ BS brand should only be reduced to a back@@ office role according to the Bank &apos;s Management Board .
the Royal Bank of Scotland is no longer available for customers outside of Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand associated with the global Am@@ b@@ itions of the Bank .
since then the Bank has since dist@@ anced since eight years ago and had to be saved .
in this period , &quot; R@@ BS &quot; has been used to protect other end consumer brands .
they supported the international sport with millions of pounds in Spon@@ sor@@ ing , from the Six Nations Rug@@ by to Wimbledon winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now it has decided to go to the more national stamps in the focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales all RS@@ B references become references , the de@@ centr@@ alised headquarters and stock exchange to Nat@@ West .
Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used to customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other things that are smaller brands for private clients who will receive more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ WAN has been inter@@ viewed during a guided tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Sh@@ ire .
he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the brand RS@@ B is coming to our investment brand as well as to the brand , among which our employees will be employed , since we now become more to a bank of brands . &quot;
when the Bank has become a global brand , R@@ BS became a global mark .
I say now that we do not track global targets but local goals .
each of these stamps will be entirely different in their own commun@@ es for something completely different and our employees will work with the customer under these stamps .
R@@ BS already told that it will not continue to continue its Six Nations Spon@@ sor@@ ing and that it will increase the importance of different brands in its Sport @-@ Spon@@ sor@@ ing .
&quot; it &apos;s time for us to develop the marks of the brand , as we focus on inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the CEO .
it would have been very z@@ yn@@ ical before three years ago , if we had said that we will be a great bank for our customers and launched this brand .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs , and not our own , I think we will see many changes .
we can again leave this brand again , therefore I think that time has come .

it is not a big meeting , it is not Royal As@@ cot - it is a ban@@ aler Friday night with 20,000 people .
I am easier and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori records the Ju@@ bel to win the victory at Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction .
two Jo@@ ck@@ ey@@ s achieved a milestone in the obstacles race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who reached more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a breaking career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ s@@ ott , the Nine D@@ erb@@ ys@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 Care@@ er defeat
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey der Moderne and it &apos;s no surprise that he achieved this milestone , just a few before him .
it has style and is strong , but it is its tak@@ est intel@@ le@@ ct that diff@@ ers it from the other in weight control room .

and it is still not at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori has told us that he wants to keep in competitions until his life of at least 5@@ 0.@@ ten .
Russian Putin dam@@ ert Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has released his Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was a few years part of the close confi@@ denti@@ ality of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed to the Special Representative for Environmental and Transport affairs .
in a position of Kre@@ m@@ lin it is that Putin can be ordered from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presi@@ dential Administration . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been a deputy chairman since 2012 , was appointed his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in 1972 in the Estonian capital of Tallinn , he graduated from the renowned National Institute of International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the embassy in Tokyo .
on the site of Kre@@ m@@ lin it is called ( in Russian ) that he later was later than the head of the government of the government council .
&quot; &quot; &quot; about his appointment he said to Putin : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think it is the most important task of government to support their activity as head of government and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov had asked to leave his position and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convince the sm@@ iling faces ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of the closest confi@@ denti@@ ality Vladimir Putin and works as he is for the Soviet secret service , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men of the country .
during a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast@@ ed in television , both men claimed that Chief of Staff will return on his own request .
but despite the smile for the cameras , only few are convinced - especially in front of the parliamentary elections .
so , is the consequence of a kind of power ?
nobody presently knows that .
but the official claim - that a man who once was elected as a potential president , would like to lead to the Russian environmental policy - fell to big sk@@ ep@@ tic@@ ism .
in his comments on Putin , who are cited on the site of the Kre@@ m@@ l. , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; it is true that I have asked for a discussion in early 2012 , to me this very complicated position - you could almost say - to be able to trust four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian Presi@@ dential Administration for four years and eight months .
Ivan@@ ov assumed the post in December 2011 .
previously , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin former Member of the State Security Service K@@ GB .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , he was appointed K@@ GB in his deputy .
as Putin he came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people who trusted in most .
once that Ivan@@ ov was supposed to turn the second term of President of Russia in the second term of office , as a third term of Put@@ ting to the Constitution .
but this post has been taken by a further , close @-@ end allies , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin was Prime Minister , before he became President of three and a half years later .
British Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gibson fired when he defeated producers
Gibson was involved last month at a physical meditation at the set of the series in Los Angeles .
ABC studios and C@@ BS Television Studios , which produce the series , announced in a common position his cancellation .
Gibson , who played the Special Agent against Aaron Hot@@ ch@@ ner , rep@@ enting himself on Thursday before the announcement of his cancellation .
the set came to artistic differences and an expression of opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I regre@@ t@@ ted the incident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details about this , like the character Gib@@ sons from the series , followed by a team of FB@@ I agents , will be published , according to the statement of ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios are expected to be released at a later date .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old played in the Sit@@ Com Dhar@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , was the first season of the series in 2005 .

Que@@ ens@@ set Cross@@ ing : bridge now associated with Fi@@ ves
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion expensive project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the North deck of the Que@@ ens@@ ac Cross@@ ing with the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - meaning that the bridge is now associated with Fi@@ bers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four slan@@ ders of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ceiling &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that make the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 slo@@ v@@ els .
the project is scheduled to be £ 1.@@ 35 billion by May 2017 .
at the construction site of K@@ eit@@ h Brown , the building site took place today a visit and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of the Que@@ ens@@ land Cross@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all vou@@ chers of engineering art at this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel , which were used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the bridge between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a he@@ at@@ le activity that require extremely precise tolerances for fit .
in total , nearly 79 % of the total brood of Br@@ ück@@ cks are in their place and the last section of the deck is now available in Ros@@ y@@ th a bed for the deck , meaning that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place .
Michael Martin , project leader of For@@ th Cross@@ ing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; the first closure shows a considerable milestone at every bridge project .
with this fantastic project the clasp is pione@@ ering high @-@ proof and deep construction .
after installing the last street cover and its connection with the se@@ wer@@ ed north @-@ deck , we had to close the existing gap on the north or landing .
this was reached by pulling the northern lift bridge 700 millimeters to the south .
this was a massive and very sensitive work at the same time .
massive because the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 222 meters long , weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be stretched upward at an incline of approximately 3 % .
as the tolerances , on which the team operates , only tiny - on each side , it was only a few millimeters .
fortunately everything went very well .
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay : three men have good luck to be alive . &quot;
three men were still alive at his life , after they were thrown from their fishing boat in front of Angl@@ es@@ ey .
the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e R@@ N@@ LI rescue station takes place on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T Alarm after an crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay .
the three men had difficulties to swim in security while their boat was moving from their own power .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw the boat in its proximity , and set us the worst before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the head of the rescue station by Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lu@@ ck@@ ily we have stopped the boat already out of its range until we left water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhau@@ sted at the age of 60 and was found on a floor without a li@@ fe@@ jacket .
they were all aboard the coastal waters and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; &quot; &quot; LORD Jones said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men who were cast into the water have no hurt and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boot engine had a not@@ ch pl@@ pl@@ a , however , it dis@@ band@@ ed , however , at the cr@@ abs of the pot off the person who controls the boat .

who builds brown cheap apartments ?
the SPD and Grün@@ e mean : investors have to be much stronger than the duty in the future .
how do you respond to bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 favorable apartments in the next few years ?
the SPD proposes a &quot; hand conversion concept &quot; to the next general meeting .
but the dispute is programmed .
first line it is about the question : who should actually build the affordable apartments ?
one regulation is missing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD Group president Christoph Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are speaking with the gre@@ enery : whoever wants to build on urban areas must show 20 percent of all apartments as social @-@ apartments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the favourable apartments can also be established in the hol@@ dings .
however , the big dispute point in the City Hall is , however , Brat@@ mann : &quot; how do we go to investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build investors at least 10 percent , but as possible as 20 percent of the apartments as social @-@ apartments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new municipal housing program that will cost millions and will be financed for incenti@@ ves .
the problem , so Fr@@ mann : &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fra@@ ctions . &quot;
the CDU wants to make investors as few rules .
the lin@@ ke intends to have hardness levels for investors .
uns@@ killed , the fr@@ ying resi@@ des itself a dis@@ appearance of the situation on the housing market .
if the concept is implemented , it will ensure additional tasks in the building management .
more staff is required .
it is un@@ clear whether we will get the skilled workers .
however , the program is not completely overhau@@ l : because the approximately 1260 new apartments that should be built @-@ in .
how is it equal to the loss of another 1300 favorable apartments , whose funding is going to run in the next few years ?
it will be 500 apartments by 2020 .
in order to prevent this , the planning spokes@@ person , Nicole Palm , should now be purchased al@@ ties from the city .
in addition , it would have to be thought about to get homes back into the price .
that is possible in the West town .
in one stroke the problem would be solved .
because in the west town the West@@ stadt desc@@ ends from the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments you could go back to the price for cheap apartments .
only : this w@@ anting to do the owners , housing companies not .
because the number of social buildings becomes dra@@ stically increases in the west city , one removed from the target of the so @-@ called passage .
the concentration of social weak in just a few cit@@ y@@ ds should not give it more .
the gre@@ enery reck@@ on that there will be movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the president Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke believes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a wide majority must the CDU with the boat &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although they are concentrated on more building sites for family homes .
but what does not say that a compromise can not be found yet .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunting after health and happiness that pays off
it is fascinating , as the world changes .
that te@@ ens and child for playing no longer go outside , but rather prefer@@ able to spend their leisure time to spend their leisure time , on screens in the last decade of many be@@ ats .
at Pok@@ em@@ on Go , people go to pick up and active people from the sofa .
the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then video games and most recently limited to smartphones .
therefore it &apos;s great to see that technology and activities do not exclu@@ de in the open .
I inter@@ connect to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that were created on the characters , initially created for video games in the 1990s ( later on it created a animation series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) .
how many phenom@@ ena of pop culture decreased the interest in front of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand in early July .
the market launch in other countries was post@@ pon@@ ed by massive demand that over@@ bur@@ dened the server .
within few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go has more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , the players go to their Smartphones without and looking for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons that were followed by a GPS after they were once found , &quot; photo &quot; ( about a screenshot on the phone ) or &quot; being taken . &quot;
one generation that played the game when she was younger , joined W@@ ahn and j@@ ump@@ ed for the search of the sofa .
in the USA , the game led to a considerable increase in steps which covers the &quot; average &quot; person every day .
cardio , an app for Apple Watch , which followed by the Washington Post recently , announced that within two days after the introduction of the game , the number of people followed , each day 30 minutes , from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company doesn &apos;t know what Pok@@ é@@ mon Go plays - it only looks for performance improvement .
many public re@@ conn@@ aissance campaigns to take care of &quot; 30 minutes &quot; to take away &quot; from the sofa , &quot; to be active every day , because many public messages are bor@@ ing to health bor@@ ing and come out of people who look like .
nevertheless the importance of sport cannot be assessed .
who regularly drives sports , reduces his opportunities to prevent cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of advantages that is too long to perform them here .
but the wonderful on Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it takes the people to do something in the open , making it a lot of fun .
thus three pillars of health are covered , fresh air and sun@@ shine as well as fun .
some people close the hunt even new friends .
as always there are m@@ ür@@ rical game destro@@ ys , which must always compl@@ ain about anything .
and yes , someone might walk against a door .
what should it be ?
it has a breakthrough .
even if smartphone apps had already been able to track our activity as Fit@@ bit , they gave us no reason to play Sport as it does this game .
the new will lose its friction and the use will be re@@ produced with the time .
however , due to the poker success , there will be more games that can join the Apps and virtual reality with the activity in the real world to help many people on the hunt , active , f@@ itter and heal@@ th@@ ier .

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ ns
forget the pressure .
forget the h@@ ype .
Simone Bil@@ es is on all that imm@@ un .
dynamic on the trampoline .
effortlessly on the beams .
stunning on the ground .
the whole line is brilliant .
and now an Olympic champion now .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American tur@@ ner@@ in kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday for multi @-@ campaign titles and increased the gap between itself and the rest of the world before all eyes under the head@@ light of the Olympic Games .
their overall results of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly in front of the silver med@@ alli@@ sts , and &quot; Final Five &quot; Team@@ kam@@ er@@ adin A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal in Ali@@ ya P@@ af@@ ina .
the Americans Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ net@@ h on the pi@@ pel@@ let during the single multi @-@ bal@@ lot of women in the gymn@@ asts of the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Summer Olympics , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osexu@@ als American , who wins a multi @-@ fight competition , and a total of the fifth , while they had a reputation to be the best of its generation or even at all .
it broke out in tears , when her end result was shown and their long journey took place at this moment .
this success represents them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Ph@@ el@@ ps , who have brought their sports on new heights :
Bil@@ es dominated their sports species , the last three years - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that she said &quot; The best gymn@@ ast , which I ever have ever seen . &quot;
they expected a last test in Brazil , a contest , which went not so very between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athl@@ ete , but rather between her and a load over@@ sized expectations .
not to return with a hand@@ ful gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be considered a dis@@ appointment .
the Americans Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man is poor , after they have won gold and silver in single multi @-@ country candidates in the 2016 Olympic Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday , on Thursday ,
Bil@@ es took the first medal in Tuesday , while on the f@@ arewell party , Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi served as an ex@@ clamation mark in Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi .
although it insi@@ sted on its long way@@ mark on top , never the future is planned , this is not really true .
part of their ground exercises - which contain its typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is tail@@ ored to Latin American music at home on the road outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
that is not a co@@ incidence .
this girl , adopted by their grand@@ parents as a little child and was discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a training trip to the gym , in which Bo@@ or@@ man trained , became strength .
since the summer of 2013 , she has no longer lost power competition , a winning stre@@ ak that will hold so long as it wishes .
even when ass@@ af@@ ina led by two turns , the image turned out .
sul@@ fur and soil particles - in which Bil@@ es keeps the World Championship title - watched .
she repeated back with 15,@@ 433 on the pi@@ g , and sat down on the ground with 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground .
Ra@@ is@@ man re@@ arm@@ oured them gently when she had expected her en@@ g@@ atory - a pure form@@ ality - and tears run on Bil@@ es shiny red , white and blue E@@ yel@@ iner , as the vision that once was described in their collection .
the performance Ra@@ is@@ mans was a ven@@ geance for the last time four years ago , when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal was in a ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke at P@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke .
this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old General Capit@@ alist , who is called &quot; O@@ ma &quot; from the Americans , had a head .
in the practice of its soil , she threw the audience of K@@ us@@ sh@@ alls , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , sometimes doub@@ ted .
what does it matter , the 19 @-@ year @-@ old has a completely new meaning of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old from the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims killed in series production during music listening in the car
according to the police report , which were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were killed in one of the most dead@@ ly attacks since one decade in the first series of mur@@ der@@ y by Phoenix , while they stopped in the car and heard music .
Angela Rochelle Liner , Stef@@ anie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 while the car was par@@ ked during a journey , the authorities said .
the perpet@@ rators fired eight shots from a hand fire weapon while standing on the passenger side of the cars , and then fled to another vehicle , is read in the report .
the police informed that the triple murder could not have been the result of a rob@@ ber@@ ship , because the attack@@ ers did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2.@@ 900 , who took possession of the adult victims .
the Poli@@ ze@@ Genet@@ ics of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard told that the shooting was the investig@@ ator to become a closer look at whether they are connected with four previous attacks .
in total , seven persons were killed in h@@ is@@ pan@@ ic residential neighbor@@ hoods within four months in nine months and two injured .
&quot; it is happening in a residential neighborhood in front of a house , &quot; said Howard the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month .
it is believed that susp@@ ects several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to make evidence of the evidence that they were linked to the conclusion that the attacks are linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to their injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities released a police report on the shooting of shooting , which was taken on an empty Pick@@ up truck , half an hour before the triple murder and assumed that it was the production of the serial mur@@ derer .
investigations found Pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen and secured a sphere from the seat as well as sphere fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ zep@@ pelin : &quot; it &apos;s better &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old loved Edmund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to the singing , toys and of course his mother .
but like the least of his aging , Edmund Micro@@ zep@@ hal@@ ie , the result of a genetic disorder , about whom his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew not during their pregnancy .
when he came home the first time I was my first idea , I don &apos;t create it .
I do not create it .
I don &apos;t let me go .
what is not true -- of course one has left on it , &quot; she said .
Vincent and her husband was told that Edmund sie cannot recognize them under circumstances and that he may not survive once .
some doctors went even so far that they struck him to acquire him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first answer it was &apos; I knew not that people still doing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Edmund can walk with the help of a hearing .
Edmund , up to his third year , neither c@@ tur@@ tle nor cra@@ w@@ ling nor speak he can &apos;t speak .
but he makes a slow progress .
he can run with support and cycling .
he also loves to play and sing along with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the drawing language that Edmund # &quot; Please sing me something &quot; out of thought . &quot;
&quot; we bring him drawing languages , &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News .
but it is not a typical character language -- says it . Edmund has invented some signs alone .
Mikro@@ zep@@ hal@@ e has a variety of causes : genetic as in Edmund , and infections with viruses such as mas@@ a or the Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus during pregnancy .
symptoms and forecasts may vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how to affect the life of infected with Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to rec@@ alls the emotional award of a certain future .
I wonder what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and they still don &apos;t know .
I have had no longer necessary since long time , because I don &apos;t expect that they can really say to me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of babies with birth damage caused by the Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus .
it is better .
they know that it will get better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .

the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near D@@ enh@@ am Springs , which are both located in Louis@@ iana , all probability come after the weekend of record level .
the Met@@ ere@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could floo@@ ded many houses in the suburbs near Bat@@ on Rouge .
he also said that a current downstream flood dec@@ ay in A@@ scen@@ sion Par@@ ish also represents a danger since that the rivers will flow slowly to the Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as .
the river ticket office , south of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi State Border in Liverpool , Louis@@ iana , reached Friday at the highest stand@@ still at 9@@ am .
rescue teams still keep people from the flood water in the district of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ k@@ inson in the southwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last great flood which we had , was in March , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this seems like a similar incident .

Mah@@ aj Brown , 6 , &quot; of spher@@ es through balls , &quot; survived shooting gallery in Philadelphia
the police informed that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot at Philadelphia , this week is already the second time that a 6 year old child is shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boys identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Mah@@ aj Brown .
the grand@@ parents gave that Brown sp@@ suffered several sh@@ ot@@ ations , including in the L@@ ende , B@@ one , Arm and belly , but that he was his transport to the hospital &apos;s hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has made a lot of pier@@ ce , his small body was pier@@ ced by balls , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; distributed his grand@@ mother Del@@ ores Mel@@ en@@ dez to the transmitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can &apos;t believe that .
the condition of the boys was classified in a hospital as a critical and he had to under@@ go several operations .
the boy &apos;s family shared the transmitter that he is expected to recover .
he had to start the first class in a local primary school .
Brown was one of four people in the town of German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are according to C@@ BS Philadelphia in a stable condition .

it came to no arrest and the police currently checks reports according to the surveillance video .
on Tuesday , another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl hit the arm as she played in front of her house in the residential area of West Palm Lane .

why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I prec@@ eded by me under the Women &apos;s Chess Olympi@@ ity and that consisted of more than a reason .
first , I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US had never been so dominant .
and second : this team has three gymn@@ asts , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , which inspir@@ ing many young girls of other skin colour .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew ist and Madison Ko@@ cian , who is cath@@ olic , complete , makes everyone proud .
this team is finally reflected the US .
it has made the black and h@@ is@@ pan@@ ic female presence at the top of this sport art .
over the last four years , the number one was one A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American female .
last year Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
that shows strength .
in the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympic sport in the Americas .
now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three @-@ time world champion Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they were unexpected , but most experienced Gy@@ ma@@ st@@ ic@@ rout@@ ines .
on Thursday , Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ osexual American , who won gold at an individual combined event for women .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won Silver .
we experience the tip of this sports type , but so you can &apos;t see gym in the whole country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie beat all the same way as A@@ ly and Madison , to make it to the olymp@@ ic team .
they are the &quot; Last Five , &quot; because the next Olympi@@ ans have only four Tour@@ ists in the team . furthermore , this is the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as train@@ ee .
but the reality looks like that Tur@@ ns is a more expensive sport and Turner first come into private cars , who are holding their parents , competition , travel , travel and hotel costs ( for the trainer and their Turner and families ) . the list may continue to continue any limitations .
the majority of these turn@@ around are in we@@ al@@ thy suburbs which support the business .
in these clubs , Turner get their entire training , and that &apos;s for the families a very expensive and long @-@ term commitment .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both have trained their athletes since they started with the Tur@@ ns .
we have to be inspired by the communities of Au@@ n countless , young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a safe and easy @-@ to @-@ reach turn@@ key .
I founded my gymn@@ ast@@ ics of 20 years ago .
in my events we have offered free and affordable tur@@ nen in Harlem for over 15.000 urban you@@ ths ( mostly black and h@@ is@@ pan@@ ic ) and national and international winners .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my home town ) to offer high quality @-@ quality wines that make the opportunity to learn from this great Olympic sport .
Tur@@ ns develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body and hard work , discipline and determin@@ ants for the spirit .
this combination offers life @-@ long advantages for health and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team , which bring thousands of young girls to care for the tur@@ keys and that is great .
it &apos;s so important to participate in the sport , especially for girls .
it is so exciting time .
thank you Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Madison for this genuine explanation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ es of the Olympic World Con@@ gol@@ ds and thank you who motiv@@ ate so many young girls with a wide background to start their way , healthy , strong and successful young women .
assist@@ ants want to organize more strikes after they have rejected Jeremy Hun@@ ts suggest@@ ion
the ministers hopes to termin@@ ate the dispute over the changes of a re@@ formed contract with the functioning of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37@@ ,000 Assist@@ enz@@ ym@@ es who are involved in a election , refused him .
in July , Hunt plans to adopt the contract , and said that the N@@ HS had agreed on &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land , &quot; and any further delay for the employees and patients were dam@@ aging .
the first assist@@ ants will receive a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend to improve the care of child@@ birth times .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chairman of the BM@@ A Committee for Assi@@ stance distributed last night in a communication with : &quot; assist@@ ants have declared to the proposed contract after serious concerns , notably that it is the current occupancy crisis and to treat all doctors to treat . &quot;
at only eight weeks , who still remain until the first group fall under the new contract , progress must be made and the time runs out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BM@@ A &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; efforts to establish the disp@@ utes by discussions with the government on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suspected &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and sometimes on o@@ hren@@ ic silence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this happened on the promise that Jeremy Hunt had only made last month about that his door would always be off@@ ended .
&quot; Jeremy Hunt must now act to lift up the asc@@ ension and concerns the wor@@ ries of assistance . &quot;
if he doesn &apos;t do this , they did not feel the assistance that they are ready to conduct further work measures .
the last strike at the end of April saw a boost of nearly 13,000 rout@@ ine@@ operations and 100.000 termin@@ ations , since n@@ urses and specialists were involved in order to grant doctors on the strike chain .
the ministers hopes to termin@@ ate the dispute over the changes of the re@@ formed agreement with the functioning of the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A would like to consider a better day of week@@ days for the 54@@ .000 de@@ men@@ aries who will be subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of the N@@ HS Emplo@@ ye@@ es , called for assistance to qu@@ it the strike .
Mor@@ timer said : &quot; work amp@@ lif@@ tions do not reach only little , but they have already loaded teams and service providers and prepare patients , care and their families with wor@@ ries , need and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
in the last two months , we talked to the Committee of Assist@@ ants and with the Ministry of Health and other minist@@ ries to the concerns relating to the pre@@ m@@ und@@ ations and of the W@@ hist@@ leb@@ low@@ ings .
the employer trusted that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as aston@@ ishment , flexibility for training , training tours , trainings and gender @-@ specific pay@@ f@@ eit banknotes in medicine - a sign that health Education England and the Ministry of Health related to compliance with the BM@@ A in November , February and May .

culture of the Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness accounts to bl@@ ossom in Muslim enemies
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ for Rah@@ man was removed last year on the execution of a government report due to corruption .
a culture of the Political Cor@@ rect@@ ile found that widespread elections to be ignor@@ ant in Muslim congregations will be igno@@ red as a devastating government report today .
the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pic@@ kl@@ es g@@ rie@@ ve the police , election observation and Rath@@ homes to have igno@@ red evidence of election abuse because of &quot; Over@@ ar@@ ities on Eth@@ nie and Religion . &quot;
the former Minister of Integration and Municipal government , which is now an ant@@ agon@@ ist , said that it would be allowed to protect the police from religious moti@@ ves so that it should be allowed to protect the police outside of elec@@ toral cabins to protect hat@@ red voters .
he recommends that voters should lead a pass to prove their identity in the elections .
at the moment a voters must name only his name and address .
the report suggests to apply no longer ink on the finger of one person if they vote their elec@@ vote to prevent any one cho@@ oses twice .
W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower should receive more protection , says Sir Eric .
he calls for the press to have more access to the municipal documents and decisions of not official guarantee or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not only for election campaign , but should also protect the municipal government before the wider corruption and financial contribution that goes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by D@@ Dow@@ ning Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets elec@@ toral and@@ als in the East of London .
last year , a special selection Court decided that the reig@@ ning mayor Lut@@ for Rah@@ man should be in@@ sol@@ dered after a lit@@ igation and illegal practices of his ministry .
the court found that Rah@@ man had the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in z@@ yn@@ ical manner , &quot; and that he had brought his critics with rac@@ is@@ sm@@ us@@ - and Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bi@@ an@@ tics to silence .
Rah@@ man should have led his campaign on the basis of the fact that it is the im@@ orous duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
up to 300 voices were either des@@ per@@ ate or the consequence of a follow @-@ up , if one person cho@@ oses another person .
Sir Eric said that there was evidence of deceit in all the land .
in particular , he expressed in particular al@@ ar@@ ming to the fr@@ au@@ dul@@ ent letter selection - at the elderly members of the Muslim community had made people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pictured , made multiple recommendations to clean@@ se the elec@@ toral system , including the fo@@ als to prove the identity
in his report it says : &quot; as proof it was appropriate that pressure on protection needs of some ethnic minority groups , especially women and young people , in order to choose according to the will of the El@@ der , in particular communities with pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ic or ban@@ an@@ ic background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were re@@ affir@@ ms that ... state institutions could be ignor@@ ant such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; polit@@ ically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; issues related to eth@@ ics and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the ban that political activists may process material to reap &quot; elec@@ toral harvest . &quot;
the report , which is drawn from Ther@@ esa May in consideration , requires even har@@ der registration tests to prevent the election directory to Im@@ mig@@ r@@ ations@@ - and social @-@ cat@@ ching purposes will be used .
please consider options to ask voters in front of your choice according to your identification .
no longer use ink on the finger of one person as soon as they have released their voice to avoid that someone cho@@ oses twice .
systematic review on National@@ ity of a person to ensure that they are entitled .
a three year limited limitation on applications on an automatic letter selection .
ban that political activists have complete postal elections and envelop@@ es .
the Police give the powers to create waste stations .
a Legislative Decree , which is an indictment due to en@@ rol@@ ment in accordance with the representation of the People Act 1983 ( the national Act of 1983 ) .
photographer banned in elec@@ oms stations .
requirement that only English may be used in elec@@ toral stations ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that the employees make the rule well that voters are going to go alone in the elec@@ toral cabin .
Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amaz@@ ingly , &quot; no criminal off@@ ence after the Tower Ham@@ lets .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the election court has Lut@@ man and his deputy representative for a lit@@ igation on corrupt and illegal practices as unt@@ au@@ glich . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was deb@@ ited due to a number of reasons for reasons - in accordance with the high requirements on the criminal proceedings .
he is also critic@@ ised the effective &quot; Ab@@ h@@ ak@@ checks &quot; of the Rath@@ au@@ ctions held in the Rath@@ homes .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the court score in Tower Ham@@ lets of the last year was a warning signal .
our country bears an impressive legacy as the mother of par@@ liam@@ ents , but the wor@@ r@@ ying and spread of voters and le@@ asing of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation .

fans of the Olympi@@ ad 2016 in Rio are a week about the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot apart from the edge and band that has proved to be an impressive double @-@ successor of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympi@@ on@@ ik@@ in is not the only one to make gold cont@@ end Ath@@ os , who has its own famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger - at least not , if you have the social media faith .
in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces , which at the time on our screens , FE@@ MA@@ IL has created a list of Olympi@@ ad that have more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood celebr@@ ities .
the h@@ unters and the Wolf : team member of the US team in the arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared with Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o since his childhood .
beside K@@ ates Doppel@@ gän@@ ant on the bike road , many people exp@@ elled on the Internet on the internet as a certain arch@@ cher of the Di@@ d@@ ym@@ us of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o could be .
the team member of the US team in the arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a ons@@ lau@@ ght on Twitter after images on which he looks like to see the Wolf of Wall Street Journal .
in fact , the bow sc@@ orer got the mad@@ ness to the social media with and gave that he has already been listening to his childhood , that he looks like Leo .
&quot; I myself do not see great simil@@ arity , with the exception of the fac@@ ial hair@@ y , &quot; Bra@@ dy the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post Office .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a goo@@ db@@ ye guy , so I hate it as a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will definitely be seen even more in the center : the surrounding simil@@ arity between the British St@@ spr@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris .
the Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with her great , expres@@ sive eyes should be considered a Doppel@@ gän@@ ger for the Cub@@ an American singer Gloria E@@ ste@@ fan .
and in the swimming pool , the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh is compared with the G@@ lee star Matthew Mor@@ rison .
one gear higher : this user is the view that Nathan is the &quot; athlet@@ ic version of the In@@ c@@ eption &quot;
another continued comparison was between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and Ac@@ tor Jos@@ h Hart@@ kind , who is similar to severe ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian Silver medal in Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ f@@ im@@ ova has more than just the sun @-@ ro@@ asted skin and bl@@ on@@ ous hair@@ s like the act@@ ress Ann@@ al@@ yn@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while American Nathan Adrian has been att@@ ested by fans , an athlet@@ ic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt .
strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar fac@@ ial form and eyes
not the One : a Twitter user was very happy about that other simil@@ arity are also fallen
theory in space : according to this user , there is perhaps a reason for the simil@@ arity of the Pa@@ ola
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter U@@ ser@@ in declared their satisfaction that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the Internet think &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hope Solo and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the US football star Hope solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter has an incredibly similar fac@@ ial form and eyes .

buyer in Pri@@ mark stamped over woman who tried in the middle of the store under@@ wear under@@ wear
the buyer did not know where they should see when a woman moved their clothes in the midst of a pri@@ mark to try under@@ p@@ ants .
to wor@@ ms the situation , they numbered them , as she looked out in it , and put them back into the shelf .
she continued and tried four pairs of under@@ p@@ ants in a shop at Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .

a mother of two children , J@@ enny David@@ son , who had been at the same time in the shop , said that after the mysterious woman had tried the under@@ wear , &quot; she went back and buy the shop without buying something . &quot;
she said , &quot; people couldn &apos;t believe what they saw . &quot;
in the middle of the sales area , they took up a pair of under@@ p@@ ants from the out@@ lay , with@@ drew its own tr@@ p@@ ants and tro@@ users and tried them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she did not try to find a somewhat dis@@ crete place to do it - she just stood there , fre@@ ch as Oskar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ red when they pulled out the under@@ p@@ ants , who obviously didn &apos;t like it , since they put them back into the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same with three more sub@@ p@@ ants before they finally decided that you liked nothing back and went down .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it seemed not to be inter@@ fer@@ ed that someone observed someone observed - or over the person who would buy the under@@ p@@ ants that she had tried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ms. David@@ son , 33 who lives in K@@ ent , said , &quot; How to think that someone would take a p@@ ants with home , who had a different person and had not been washed . &quot;
the incident happened on Tuesday morning .
David David@@ son said : &quot; as I have received , the staff tried to draw the clothes from the sale after she went - what is just as good . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate it with a new pair of tro@@ users to go home and to find out that another woman had her and went out and did not get washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a speaker of Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday 9 August in our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

how to protect with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a before tru@@ ce attacks
the world without is a dangerous place but this video from D@@ ail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it some secure .
we talked with Rh@@ on Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand@@ master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a composer in New York to find out how to move with armed rob@@ bers at hand .
regardless of whether you &apos;re closer to you from the front or behind , this video will show you how to rotate your th@@ iev@@ es .
if you get behind it from behind , then you should be turning as the first , so that you can see your attack@@ ers and enter &quot; from the Line &quot; says Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi .
take the weapon between your fore@@ arm and your shoulder before you beat him with your free Ell@@ bow .
strike him then with the knees to the l@@ ath and turn off , while the attack@@ er is cr@@ ushed out of pain , the weapon from his hands . beat him with the race and move on back@@ ward , while they set the weapon on him .
when attack@@ ers approach themselves from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the line , take the weapon and turn them , so that the attack@@ ers cannot shoot .
at the same time , rein@@ forcing the weight on the weapon and beat the attack@@ ers on the chest , then turn off the weapon from its grip before moving down and place the weapon on him .
sounds hard ?
watch the video to see exactly how to make Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that there is a rob@@ ber@@ y at the saf@@ est point to go your money - if you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master .
travel Ian Wright sch@@ t for a guide to the dirty places of Europe
a British traveler under@@ drew his immune system and Con@@ ger@@ ef@@ lex of a serious test - surrounded by some of the most dirty and cold places of Europe .
the moder@@ ator and travel author Ian Wright , 51 , out of Suff@@ olk will lead his course on a Euro Sch@@ ein , a rail@@ ing on Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a r@@ ins@@ ing pot of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance of its immune system .
in front of the so@@ cks of any object , he used an L@@ umin@@ ometer to move and to show us what he is left .
but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; brought some surprising results in daylight .
the thought that has been used to refuse a tens@@ ile strength of a train toilet , which has already been used by thousands of others , may be completely sho@@ wering , but actually you are in a kitchen dispens@@ ing more bad bacteria .
on his journey through Europe , Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals across the fo@@ als of gut bacteria and his own health .
lu@@ ck@@ ily , nothing left what he ab@@ le@@ aked , more than a bad after@@ taste in his mouth .
Mr. Wright has been known to test the resistance of his gut by going through the world and ate amazing things as well as wonderful things .
from public funds to train stations until go to jet@@ ting of toilets , the task introduced his immune system definitely under a sample
in the film he told : &quot; already as a child , I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all the possible things in my mouth , Earth , wor@@ ms , and mud water . &quot;
in the film he was definitely justified .
the only thing he turned off , was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his trial file showed a lumin@@ ance of more than 4000 units .
in comparison , the L@@ umin@@ ometric number is fresh@@ ly washed hands than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet that refused to ref@@ res@@ h after their lumin@@ ance count over 4000 units , while fresh@@ ly washed hands have a capacity of less than 60 .
Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products validation produced the travel film &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria at different places like the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the worst thing I smo@@ ked in a toilet , close &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are nothing dirty than that !
I will not sn@@ ails here because it is in@@ scri@@ bed here .
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturers of dairy products vali@@ o .
the company pays Mr. Wright with Vali@@ o encoder , which contains both l@@ actic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the support of intest@@ inal bacteria and the immune system .
validation Senior Venice President for snacks , ju@@ ices and new categories N@@ iko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to make a really something new .
a bit that is fascinating and the benefits of pro@@ biotics is explained at the same time .
we were crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings , which caused that we said , &quot; Let us call us Ian . &quot;
they claim that the interest in the intest@@ inal health becomes a global phenomenon
instead of just about the products , we wanted to put them in a greater context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of the intest@@ inal health and the immune system is linked to the immune system .
growing interest in the intest@@ inal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide more information on an interesting way .

Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the direc@@ ting of the film , added : &quot; let me tell me - I would have tast@@ ed my respect for Ian , if he had been sent to him some of the things that I instructed him to live in the film . &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to bring them , and others in which this was pretty difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad that we have recorded some of these dirty work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

A@@ social family destro@@ ys soci@@ ation of social apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
a o@@ cial family left their social apartment after a dol@@ ph@@ ation of £ 50,000 , because she had terr@@ orized its neigh@@ bors .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and their partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list on complaints from their property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
when they were for@@ ci@@ bly removed from her estate , sho@@ cking employees of the housing cooperative was property in an ir@@ repaired state .
the walls were cl@@ oned holes on wooden floors were torn , rub@@ b@@ ish were ador@@ ned on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was ador@@ ned with walls .
the family were settled and it is believed to live in a private accommodation
Donn@@ a Mc@@ Ev@@ o@@ y , who works for home management at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it fears not to repair any more .
she said , &quot; It was an absolute album for people here and I am the view that people do not have to live in this way .
there are many things to take into account , since this property is thought to be considered as a beautiful part of Corn@@ walls .
the family is inf@@ am@@ ous and their reputation is it too .
the couple had three sons , who lived for a time in the apartment and the police said that the terror , which had added the family , in@@ timi@@ date f@@ isheries , drug abuse , drug tra@@ ff@@ icking , drugs , and exc@@ essive write permission .
sk@@ el@@ eton , 47 , whose name stood on the rental agreement , was placed in June an arrangement for anti @-@ iso@@ ara behaviour .
in some areas of the house , which is torn down under circumstances , old gar@@ bage was found
at the property , where in the past drugs have been tra@@ ded , the wooden sh@@ rim@@ ps were torn
neighbours therefore said that they were fighting on the road and had to settle the police regularly .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ og@@ ged her and her partner this week for@@ ci@@ bly off the property after they gave them a prolonged period of 11 weeks to volunte@@ er voluntarily .
the Del@@ og@@ ation were che@@ ered by ligh@@ tening neighbours who told her life to hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They were ashamed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years next to them and it &apos;s always bad .
the countless times that we say the police are incredible .
&quot; tomorrow we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood up because there was so quiet - that &apos;s not usual !
now , where they are finally gone , it will be beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it would have the family to co@@ operate with local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police was called regular intervals , 20 years long .
gar@@ bage and old toys were thrown on the out@@ fitted side of the Municipal House
he added : &quot; it is a shame that it was the ten@@ ant to adopt any responsibility for their behaviour and to their family , as a delay is always the last step , the Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing enters into account .
that was a very difficult case since the behaviour was extremely difficult and their deeds for their neighbours must be terrible .
I guess all the work that my team , the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the church , have cour@@ age@@ ous to us and have made us the information provided .
I hope that this development will not be toler@@ ated in some neighbours , and the message will not be toler@@ ated .
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons have lived at different times in the house , but that they all may be over 20 .
a dirty mattress located in one of the bedrooms of the house after Del@@ og@@ ation dropped on the ground
workers of the house management will now have to w@@ ished gar@@ bage flowers that sur@@ round the house
in 2014 , the police conducted a raid on the house and took over 70@@ g cannabis as well as f@@ ab , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alien and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
sk@@ el@@ eton received a fine of fine , after having found guilty of a threat of class B in commercial view .
it claimed that the money was a gra@@ vest@@ one of their son Lee sk@@ el@@ don at a car accident in 2013 .
after being without Ob@@ d@@ ach , it is assumed that T@@ anya and her partner now live in a private accommodation in Plymouth .
many room walls of the house were gra@@ ff@@ ed with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the Police says that they will not hold r@@ enters , which do not hold themselves to the house regulations .
Angela C@@ row from the Devon and Corn@@ wall police informed that Del@@ og@@ ation is a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants , which do not hold itself to the house regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think they are without self @-@ car@@ ve , as well as those who were ra@@ ced from such a behavior , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Police of Devon and Corn@@ wall will never toler@@ ate criminal off@@ cial and ant@@ aneous behaviour that continue to work with partners to protect our congregations .

the leadership of the US rep@@ ublic@@ ans is wor@@ ried by massive wor@@ ries , even in traditional conservative states their majority .

a rare moment , in which usually large @-@ track and self @-@ safe Mul@@ tim@@ illi@@ ons , such as concerns expressed as correspon@@ dents reported .
after having thrown 16 ri@@ vals within the Republi@@ can camp from the race , the Zweifel we@@ aves its success in the fight for the White House .
&quot; we have tremendous problems in Utah , &quot; said Tr@@ ump from evangel@@ ical Christians , which he asked for support in major federal states such as Ohio , Florida , or Virginia .
in his fault , false reports about his candi@@ dat@@ ure , he took up his well @-@ known media .
republi@@ can high bur@@ gers
Utah is usually a secure bank for Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
a survey conducted by Surv@@ ey@@ USA from June 2015 , Tr@@ ump and his competitors from the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton , were equal .
other institutes see tr@@ ump in front , however , not with the distance , which are common to Republi@@ can candidates in the state of State .
Arizona and Georgia are considered end@@ anger@@ ed .
in an interview of the transmitter CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump said to the question how He would stop Clin@@ ics again : &quot; just as I have done it so far . &quot;
and whether behind : this will be &quot; either successful , or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he doesn &apos;t do anything to tell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is not rich for him in the end of reasons of political correc@@ t@@ ness , the vote , &quot; Tr@@ ump said . &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the party shall be threatened to submit money to the support of his election campaign , he should not present any better exchange rate .
instead of what you need to raise the candidates of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans to the congress stronger among arms .
Olympia : Dre@@ ister fr@@ aud at d@@ oping test
the IOC wants to raise a discipline Commission to the case .
Ken@@ yan athletes threat@@ ens after the second d@@ oping aff@@ air during the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games .
Kenya has sent a coach at home in Kenya in a d@@ oping control for d@@ oping control in Kenya .
the International Olympic Committee shared with a dis@@ solution to investigate the case in order to investigate the case .
a ken@@ ian@@ ative func@@ tionary revealed that the former Sprinter and today coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , in the Olympic Village an Ur@@ in rehear@@ sal under the name of the 800 @-@ meter L@@ eller F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i .
this is the team @-@ management Ken@@ yan was reported by d@@ oping control systems .
the IA@@ AF world association has searched for information about the case to impos@@ e their own investigations , a IA@@ AF speaker has dealt with .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following actions of the IOC , the IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in a IA@@ AF statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the d@@ oping control station and gave himself as a F@@ erg@@ us@@ on red , the rehear@@ sal and under@@ signed , &quot; said Ken@@ yan Chef de Mission Stephan ar@@ ap So@@ i .
he was the possession of the ac@@ creditation of athletes who stood on the list for the training control of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i was in 2015 in Beijing World Cup fourth more than 800 meters .
four days earlier , the Ken@@ yan Athlet@@ ics Minister Michael Rot@@ ich had been deduc@@ ted from the Rio Olympics .
it is supposed to have informed about the pay@@ backs athl@@ ete from his country on the upcoming d@@ oping tests .
according to media reports , he allegedly was arrested at his return at the airport of Nairobi .
Kenya has been under special observation for the IOC after many d@@ oping control over time .
during the announcement of the more than 2000 d@@ oping targets in front of the Rio games , the Rio Games was previously noted that particularly athletes from Kenya and Russia will be taken into vis@@ or .
the world @-@ anti @-@ d@@ oping agency had exercised much pressure on the African country in Brazil , an anti @-@ d@@ oping law and a working control system .
the law was approved a few weeks before the Olympia began .
the WA@@ DA Kenya took part in Kenya from the list of countries whose d@@ oping control conform to the rules of WA@@ DA .
Kenya is considered a great runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won most medals in the World Cup 2015 in Peking .
in a series of television reports the ARD became increasingly acute , that in Kenya D@@ oping means they are easily accessible and there is a significant ment@@ ality of the sports bet@@ ru@@ gs .
IOC member Richard Po@@ und claimed a similar study in Kenya as he had completed her in the Russian athl@@ ics .
it was proven that this sport @-@ type and systematically po@@ or@@ ted in this sports type .
Russia athletes were therefore excluded from the summer games .

with a surprising Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli .
one musical direction Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ one masterpiece .
the artistic director Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical ensem@@ bles , and was filled with the role of Mary a youth space .
in the orchestra pit , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ elan conductor Gust@@ av@@ o D@@ ud@@ amel : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he is war@@ med .
we always say that they are very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their pace and their mel@@ ody .
it is a wonderful blend , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have Bern@@ st@@ one music in our blood !
in this st@@ aging , Bart@@ oli plays an elder Mary .
they are remin@@ is@@ cent of her lovers with Tony , while the younger lady plays and dance .
the role of Mary has always fascin@@ ated me .
first , because she is musi@@ cally exceptional !
and then there &apos;s still Mary &apos;s personality .
she says in her song : &quot; I feel Pre@@ t@@ ty , oh so Pre@@ t@@ ty , I feel Pre@@ t@@ ty and wit@@ ty and B@@ right . &quot;
so it is smart , of course also n@@ ai@@ v , and very passionate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they resem@@ bles me very , my Italian character , whom I have as Rö@@ mer@@ in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laugh@@ s Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ ud@@ amel is a wonderful artist for the opera singer : &quot; Cec@@ ilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is so honour to work with her .
she is an un@@ hardened person .
and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; D@@ ud@@ amel is so an extraordinary artist and passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a need for him .
you can see it in any of his movements , in his looks , it &apos;s his life !
it is so a huge chance to share this musical experience with Him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a happy approach to life , that &apos;s very important at all !
for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; high @-@ date : &quot; in this piece it is about advantages and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism . &quot;
today we have passed the refugees , then the Pu@@ ert@@ ori@@ ans went to New York , and the New York inhabitants didn &apos;t want to go .
they are the same topics , and they are as well @-@ looking today as it was then .
59 years later , the piece is still relevant .

in February 2015 , Sult@@ ana and two other school girls from the East of London went into a plane to Turkey , then a bus to the Syrian border .

Turkey : Kur@@ dish congregation expects mass flight
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyone who doesn &apos;t fit and du@@ chy , s@@ itt@@ eth on packed caffeine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Chair of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Dialogue and Welt , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the short term , the Kur@@ dish congregation Germany expects a short term of thousands of protective seek@@ ers who fled from Turkey to Germany .
in the medium term , there could even be &quot; a few hundred thousand , &quot; the presi@@ ding leader Ali Top@@ ra@@ k .
because of the hard advance of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erd@@ og@@ an , the Kur@@ dish congregation of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; short @-@ term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; short term , with a few hundred thousand protection seek@@ ers from Turkey in Germany , when the Erd@@ og@@ an regime fought the min@@ orities and the democratic opposition &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the President &apos;s President Top@@ ra@@ k , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because the government had moved with offen@@ ders already before months ago , 500,000 Kur@@ ds in Turkey on the run .
after the failed coup s@@ ails , se@@ cular and op@@ positi@@ onal ethnic Turks was added .
many will be rest@@ art@@ ed in Europe if they are supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can &apos;t be that a state that assi@@ sts refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team @-@ president accused the targeted settlement of Syrian Arab in Kur@@ dish , but also in al@@ ev@@ it@@ ical cities .
thus , Erd@@ og@@ an would raise Earth &apos;s travel pressure on the remaining cur@@ ses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last great minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks were cut off or exp@@ elled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past hundred years , &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also the CDU member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chief of Staff demanded that the federal government has set itself as sharp as the Austria against Erd@@ og@@ an and his followers . &quot;
in Germany there is also a &quot; wit@@ ch hunting grounds &quot; against Erd@@ og@@ an critics .
I feel no longer in Germany for the first time in the last months .
the German branch of the quality movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
more Turks are looking for asylum in Germany , mainly Kur@@ ds and opposition .
the fire mark@@ er than Gü@@ len tra@@ ilers are destroyed teachers and other academ@@ ics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyone who doesn &apos;t adap@@ ts and Erd@@ og@@ an , s@@ itt@@ eth on packed caffeine , as well as the Kem@@ alists and se@@ cular , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Dialogue and Education , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the newspaper reports on the figures of the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs , the Turks had already reported the largest group of asylum in Germany before the coup d &quot; coup .
as at the reporting date June 30 , this is 11,@@ 386 people and there@@ with almost 29 percent of all known as as@@ yl@@ justified ( 3@@ 9.@@ 625 ) .

Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; where to go where it &apos;s we@@ aving &quot;
Sel@@ ts@@ ames Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the nati@@ ves get nothing of the summer campaign with - and the holidays from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to choose the Parliament .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
the Parliament election will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays , the sword will already decided at the beginning of the year .
for that time it is not so far : summer holidays , heat and farming cont@@ ention .
the nati@@ ves that are convinced by the candidates are on vacation .
the very most holidays that are on the country , on U@@ se@@ dom , Rü@@ gen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not native to choose from the country .
these are practical problems : in the holidays are hel@@ pers who are puff@@ ed up the posters , split air bal@@ lo@@ ons , fl@@ yers , and count towards the end of the vote .
until 4 September 2016 , the election and final day of all day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to pass a campaign against itself again by the people of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern .
the hot phase when you can say it has just begun .
and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Erwin Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CDU coalition , must be on the position of his ministry .
the SPD , since 1998 the strongest party , is now in poll@@ s behind the CDU .
exciting how strongly Ne@@ ul@@ ing Af@@ D cuts and remains at the end of the ambitious wal@@ low .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old , and since 2008 Head of government , makes an almost in@@ con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous election campaign , one sees his big pl@@ aten .
he travels across the land , distributed Ros@@ en and pl@@ au@@ sts a little with the people , as it did as well as his legendary , Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff &apos;s predecessor , Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff .
otherwise Se@@ af@@ ering has got the old feet and the ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or Merkel gave the gu@@ ilt on the bloo@@ d@@ stream of the Af@@ D .
their refugee policy , you &quot; We &apos;re able to accelerate the rise of the pop@@ uli@@ sts , which is probably going to cost him now .
the CDU with its nick@@ name , the Interior Minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has experienced , as it is , if one makes a wrong place in the right place of election campaign .
she was invited twice as Chancellor Angela Merkel by the German Chancellor Angela Merkel , the German Chancellor Angela Merkel is in the northeast .
but the target group did not agree that there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; there was probably the majority from other federal states , &quot; accused Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary @-@ General of the CDU in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR .
but nobody can listen to anyone from other corners of Germany , at least Angela Merkel .
otherwise the North East CDU identi@@ fies the usual election events on market places and shopping m@@ alls with paras@@ ols and bal@@ lo@@ ons .
that , so Kok@@ ert , plays only a &quot; sub@@ ordin@@ ate role . &quot;
the Union also noted that all of you w@@ ander out on the land that it needs to be very strict to find a wire to the people again .
it is like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : hardly available in the fields of the country .
however , the Council of the CDU elec@@ tor co@@ ca@@ ert to his fel@@ low@@ soldier is also self @-@ deduc@@ tible : &quot; you have to go there where people are : dor@@ ff@@ est , Golden weddings , each birthday party must be used . &quot;
because many of it stands on the game , Sell@@ ering has now called for a particularly dedicated election campaign .
in surveys , the Socialists and Democrats last were last with 22 percent behind the CDU ( 25 ) and just just ahead of the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
with the 2011 election the SPD gained a clear increase of 3@@ 5.6 percent before the CDU ( 22 ) .
the green , small party with seven percent in surveys , will be able to create the jump in the country &apos;s day .
they are out of the holidays ad@@ versity , modern dreams and conce@@ aling their election campaign great part to the internet .
&quot; online campaign &quot; is called the President Claudia Müller .
otherwise , there are green elec@@ toral soldier on track search for loc@@ als with local vote .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the peak an@@ di@@ min@@ in , kur@@ t straight with a house boat through the m@@ eckl@@ en@@ bur@@ gische L@@ akes and finds it even beautiful .
your impression : &quot; elec@@ torate in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a penalty . &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ Rehabilitation : restaurants suffer from locking
on the speed , with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ it@@ ated , there is nothing to wake up .
for the leaders of the construction work , starting at 5.@@ 30 in the morning and at least 20 o &apos;clock in the morning , there is all@@ enth@@ al@@ praise praise .
&quot; they have made all pretty heavy , &quot; says El@@ vira T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the jet fuel station .
this is a super@@ team .
there is no delay .
the construction site was scheduled to be transferred to the mid @-@ season as scheduled to the south until the end of October is to be finished .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blessed is also the finding of the construction of persons responsible for the construction of accommodation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the construction site took place on Monday to the south , and the blocking of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ f@@ ter@@ dy@@ nia was abolished and thus also the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg , the traffic situation has been relaxed within the resort .
the citizens can now return from O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 on both sides .
the soft traffic through the place seems to be returning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were some significant complaints , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the responsible spokes@@ man of the refurb@@ ishment of the rehabilitation management of Florian King . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the residents of Bach@@ ar Road , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ n@@ erst@@ raße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many s@@ wap bodies were sought and rather to serve their Nav@@ i .
what led to that maneu@@ ver trucks in residential zones .
since the speed lim@@ iting was not observed , the municipality demanded the measuring vehicle from M@@ ess .
&quot; there were significant belie@@ fs , &quot; says King who made himself a spot on the location .
there are already two to three per minute inj@@ ected .
the quick@@ est speed was on the way with 77 km / h in the pace @-@ 30 zone .
since the construction site is moved , but it was quiet yet .
for the business operators at the B 27 , it is only a small consol@@ ation that is now open to customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg .
in the cards , business@@ men do not like to look .
but that the B 27 @-@ reconstruction of them has led to sales in sales , each one asks which one asks , through .
however some more and some less are affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyone who has to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; End@@ less &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will have been produced for other companies , for which the refurb@@ ishment could hardly follow . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; no more light decline in the car deal@@ er@@ pillar of Mai@@ er , but also one of course is missing . &quot;
the biggest explo@@ res are the local traffic along the street .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds clear words .
this is already threat@@ ening .
not only him , but all the restaurants have met it hard . &quot;
they lack@@ ed the guests from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil .
we must be happy about every euro turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the revenues amounted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far above 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road restoration have thrown his operation &quot; by two years . &quot;
he has dismissed half of his staff .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed , policy would have re@@ acted differently .
instead , government presi@@ ded Jörg Schmidt on an en@@ quiry of G@@ öh@@ ner , whether it might answer a financial compensation , otherwise it would have to benefit from the advantages of the situation at the B 27 . now , they must even add the dis@@ advantages that produce themselves through the refurb@@ ishment .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other rural districts where something gener@@ ously handled .
in all clubs , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue .
after all , the family business has been settled here since 17@@ 15 , where he refers to the long history .
it can be understood less frequently due to the complicated transport of traffic in less frequently due to the complicated traffic management .
if you can &apos;t drive it , it is also very different .
after the end of the renovation works , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt about it .
despite the cris@@ es with BSE and a bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the impact of the B 27 construction work on his rally for the largest crisis which has experienced his restaurant in its long @-@ standing history .
six months of construction , which is brutal .
permanently under the name of the terror control in laws .
after the youngest attacks , Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is now a thick safety package .
but what does a Dul@@ ce status to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is the Re@@ conc@@ iler .
all its proposals are polit@@ ically acceptable to the coalition partner , &quot; says the Federal Minister of the Interior during the presentation of his new security package .
they re@@ claim no one .
other , further points would first be discussed within the parties .
I took part in it too .
but the Minister of the Interior , however , was to him in terms of results and in a &quot; re@@ cover@@ able con@@ sens@@ us &quot; within the coalition .
after the most recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach had a little time , before he presented his conclusions for the safety of the Republic .
but they are so much more extensive .
a lot has been announced , announced that a new security authority is to take care of encrypted communication , is not new .
it is also not the fact that Germany must implement multiple EU directives and weapons law .
the call for more video surveillance and staff for security authorities is not surprising .
as part starts de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is a second attraction for suggestions that were not to do with the SPD : he wants to pun@@ ish sympath@@ y for terror groups and jihadists with double citizenship to the German passport .
&quot; this will be difficult to score points for the SPD , &quot; the CDU male of the CDU .
he still kept this for ut@@ op@@ able and ask nothing , what did not have any opportunities in the coalition partner .
a few new ideas presents de Mai@@ zi@@ ère .
they are partly in itself : he plans to process rapid procedures for shi@@ fts and more possibilities for the detention of humans in front of deportation .
before being transferred to the country , they are expected to check their smartphone in advance and check social media accounts for a security check .
during Dul@@ ce for past asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to make some worse than ever - about such a criminal off@@ ences or their papers consci@@ ously to wear their identity .
some of them is polit@@ ically and legally blin@@ kel .
man@@ ches works even un@@ balanced and can be un@@ balanced .
and with some points - at the un@@ equal treatment of thought , the question arises : what does this have to do with safety and terror ?
yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the topics of refugees and terror .
but it is not possible to speak that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg refugees .
in addition , many people in the presence of high refugee numbers should be wor@@ ried about security .
and things which the people employed people , now do not let rise up in election times .
the inner safety is enormous in the focus .
first the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the un@@ certainty is large .
and yes , there are election campaign .
Union and SPD focus on inner safety , therefore increasingly in position .
in the last days there went up between the two parties .
only a gar@@ den@@ ier dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then demand through a security policy collection of some Unions Minister , in which the Ress@@ ort@@ ch@@ efs also call a bur@@ ka ban and a return from double citizenship .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère was too hard to reconc@@ ile the sounds here .
from a return from the double pass he doesn &apos;t stop .
we have satisfied the discussion in Germany .
you will be re@@ voc@@ able , it is not sen@@ sible .
and by a Bur@@ ka @-@ ban , he was constitutional obj@@ ections .
whether his own package is un@@ fixed to all corners , and whether it is indeed &quot; zum@@ able &quot; is not yet present for the coalition partner .
there &apos;s a lot in what to fight for war .
but the SPD also tries to pro@@ filing an inner safety during inner safety .
&quot; &quot; &quot; contrac@@ tor Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ alized only a time to talk on discussion and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even Volkswagen g@@ lim@@ it@@ ably come through .
despite diesel and@@ als , the delivery volume will increase worldwide .
but it does not work in all markets .
in the case of feedback there is verteb@@ ra@@ e for a term .
Volkswagen kicks off in terms of deliveries to the second half of the year .
Europe &apos;s biggest motor@@ sport in the previous year , despite its many brands and some good run markets , can continue to grow further .
but in July , the VW weak@@ ened the VW &apos;s nuclear brand , especially in Western Europe and re@@ loaded the total sale , as stated in the D@@ ax company .
in July , the VW brand sold in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars and 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than in the previous year .
in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
in the home market of Germany , deliveries are almost a sixth place .
the CEO of Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weaker numbers from July , mainly to two sales days less in Europe .
in addition , it has also been implemented in some core markets by &quot; modified economic conditions . &quot;
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote for the withdrawal from the EU , also explained a spokes@@ woman .
in the US , where the exhaust gas aff@@ air was first es@@ cal@@ ated , also stands a min@@ us of be@@ ech .
great support for VW is the Chinese market .
overall , the mainly concerned domestic record of Lower Saxony would continue to continue through the diesel and@@ al : according to the first seven months , only a delivery minus of 0.9 percent to 3,@@ 37 million vehicles is available .
Group CEO Fred Kap@@ pler could lead to an increase in sales from January to July .
1.3 percent more vehicles delivered to Volkswagen at this time , 5,@@ 904 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated with a software testing .
in Germany alone , VW is calling around 2.5 million cars to re@@ arm@@ ament into the workshops .
in the course of re@@ arm@@ ament , VW re@@ affir@@ med that the conversion of cars has no negative effects .
after upgrading of vehicles there is no deteri@@ oration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the motor@@ ing point of the customer according to the conversion , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guaranteed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Certificate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not talk about a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it was on Friday in the field of Companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reason , legal host@@ esses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen granted his German customers now a guarantee for the diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this would have confirmed the same Monday VW representative at the Federal Ministry of Environment in the past Monday .
from the ministry of the ministry , there was confirmed that this meeting was meeting .
&quot; VW has decided to fulfil the editions of my investig@@ ating commission and the KBA customer . &quot;
&quot; der@@ og@@ ations of this are not accepted , &quot; declared Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs , Alexander Do@@ fi@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry .
VW has acquired the guarantee that in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power after re@@ arm@@ ament , no deteri@@ oration will remain unchanged and all typ@@ ing relevant vehicles have been unchanged .
Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; War@@ ran@@ ty &quot; but not as it was called in business circuits .
with the wide concept &quot; guarantee , Volkswagen sees the possibility for example a half year after the retro@@ fitting end about with a motor damage in a workshop - and that could return to the new software , even though the damage has nothing to do .
also in customer interest , it is important to avoid that there are any damage to do with the ab@@ g@@ ass@@ al to any other damage , which does not occur with regard to any warranty claims , even as it was called .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , use the VW term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see requires the future savings in the future - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; ban@@ ker Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s only by 139 customers who park 40 million euros on tox@@ or or daily newspapers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Federal Association of German Banking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speaks of a single case and does not see a signal : normal Spar@@ er must not be afraid to pay for their au@@ ster@@ ile criminal off@@ ences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
store banks money over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , you need to pay 0.4 per cent of pen@@ alties .
the fee requires the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund from September of private and corporate clients for deposits of more than 100,000 euros on tox@@ or or daily newspapers .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100.000 will cost 400 Euro in the year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has maintained 40 million Euros since the time , which could be withdrawn from one day to the other , and that he could not reach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bank aims at the central bank account and will cause a total of 0.4 per cent &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the Bank head . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t lay € 4000 for every million Euros . &quot;
after the urs@@ or principle , he is now moving forward .
the cash is easy to leave in the saf@@ es of Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank would have been much too dangerous : &quot; I &apos;ve never seen four over@@ cases , I don &apos;t still have the fifth ! , &quot; said the CFO .
most customers have their understanding and changes to other investment shapes .
only few emigrated to other banks .
the cooperative society of Bavaria stated : &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the ECB causes considerable costs in all banks . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it alone can be worn alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; business inspir@@ ing permanently &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account , credit cards or transfers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with pen@@ alties for deposits of three million euros , the Thuring@@ ian People and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank Al@@ ten@@ burger Land had made head@@ lines in 2014 .
Michael Kem@@ mer , main managing director of the Ban@@ ken@@ verb@@ andes , said : &quot; we do not expect that private clients will have to pay for deposits , with the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks too much too strong . &quot;
a ban@@ ker said , at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see , there is a client@@ ele that is equipped with a little l@@ ush . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this may be a small bank to the problem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they feed for free money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
founded in 1911 , the cooperative bank has offices in Bad Wies@@ see , R@@ ott@@ ach @-@ E@@ glad@@ bach , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
in the region , actors , athletes and entrepren@@ eurs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bavaria &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cooperative society &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bayern &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are currently no other banks announced , which will charge a payout percentage for deposits of private clients &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; spokes@@ person Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the President of the German national banks and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ sic banks ( BvR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared end of June : &quot; the threshold of neg@@ atives to neg@@ atives , is very high , very high . &quot;
the competition be hard , and it dro@@ ves the migration of investors to competition .
customers in Germany will not like that in the width .
dist@@ ination plates : who can actually buy sound plates ?
lon@@ ely men love middle ages .
before you divide the comm@@ ent@@ ator to over@@ sow@@ ing him under the pseud@@ onym Non@@ Al@@ le@@ one @-@ notification @-@ age age with har@@ sh pres@@ crip@@ tions , this statement is derived from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the most common re@@ vit@@ alization of sound plates do not want to gre@@ et on a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als which wants to gre@@ et the re@@ ty of physical objects , but due to mid@@ life @-@ nost@@ al@@ gia .
those who have recently bought a record , are all fo@@ resi@@ ght according to the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely buyer group .
there is also no hor@@ des by hob@@ by@@ ists - it has a emotional meaning : older panel buyers retain their feelings more for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
if this blog would be a news report on TV , I would follow me the camera , while in the midst of a business road in S@@ oho , a modest grey suit moves and wild , before I stop , my hands hold and some determin@@ ants such as : &quot; so , let us take a closer look at it . &quot;
so , let &apos;s take a look at it .
even if the heart of So@@ h@@ os is slow to its charm , hotels , restaurants and offices are now re@@ plen@@ ished the buildings where once independent sal@@ es@@ are located - there is like a hand@@ ful of fantastic top shops .
I would probably ask the camera of camera to turn the camera to the next part where I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to estimate their age and mind through observation .
Stuart from Glasgow , 55 , whom I am from S@@ ister Ray ( data number : two young women , three men middle ages ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( data number : eight men middle age , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; I guess , &quot; he says .
I have about 3.000 or 4.000 plates .
this sound panels , pictured above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I &apos;m not followed after home ) , with the walls of his living room .
the reason why he has such a siz@@ able number of albums and singles , is the result of his available income : it is now able to buy plates that he could not aff@@ ord to buy them and to buy items that he sold , when he was young and ple@@ ite .
&quot; many things I buy , are of the late 60s , early &apos; 70s , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I probably was too young to buy them , &quot; he says .
it is true to those who buy the plates , rather than ver@@ ted and glad@@ ly spend time , and adds : &quot; I smoke not and I drink not much .
this is my aster .
We@@ z , 25 , who also works with S@@ ister Ray , believes that many clients who meets the You@@ Go@@ v profile .
however , he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and to see their old records again .
of the talks I have led , people usually have been buried in their collection in 1998 or 1999 .
customers that were once sold their records to buy converting CDs , now sell their CDs to buy their records . &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom to supporters of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional meaning of records ?
it only takes some seconds in a business like phon@@ ica to detect that sheet business offers a soo@@ thing community of equ@@ ations .
according to We@@ z some of the older customers participated in the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some disk fans are overwhel@@ med from the digital world and want to cover the stability of trusted sil@@ ver@@ ters , of objects , the lucky events .
&quot; I think , sometimes it can be the col@@ t of a void or the possession of material poss@@ essions as a kind of comfort , &quot; says We@@ z .
that is with me as a collector so and I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to deal with spiritu@@ ally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social worker ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still killed a staff of a record stack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was a survey of IC@@ M in April , that almost 50 % of people who have bought a record in the last month they have not heard .
the survey also found that 41 % have a record player that they never use them , while 7 % of those who buy a record , have no record players .
at this time of the message I would probably look very concerned , while I bl@@ amed through a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova Kom@@ pil@@ ations .
J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works with sounds of the Universe ( numbers : three of the aged ages ) has performed a &quot; t@@ rophy &quot; of the Revi@@ val . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone came only recently here and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player , but I &apos;d like to buy a radio record that I can put it into the shelf &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a big percentage , but it will definitely happen .
more productive , less musi@@ kl@@ ast@@ y .
we have people who say : &quot; I have no record players . &quot;
these are younger people , not older , who first come slowly .
F@@ opp , which has dedicated the sound plates for almost a whole floor , has a b@@ lower audience , when I am clean .
there are couples around 70 , tourists , take pictures , teenagers and middle ages .
even if the atmosphere is a little less relaxed than in the af@@ ore@@ mentioned shops , Wild Be@@ asts is the latest syn@@ thes@@ izers and examinations packed pop instead of experimental jazz from the speakers - it &apos;s good to see such diversity in the customers .
none of them is strange , but n@@ ag@@ ingly psych@@ ic trau@@ mat@@ a are hard to be fixed , if you still stands next to someone 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , runs within a few minutes of business and considered the vari@@ ability for sale of the plates .
it rather makes a piece of man@@ ne@@ sting ship than a big buy .
they don &apos;t des@@ erve a lot , therefore the collection of records not a real option , says it .
it costs much .
it is easy to listen to music from one computer or to other way , but the beauty of plates is ... &quot; it drives with a twi@@ sted sig@@ h .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it really is unique .
my last stop is a business which is said that a new generation of record lovers have to be inspired by Urban Out@@ ams .
while I give the ticket to number Je@@ ans Hot@@ p@@ ants , I observe a group of young teen@@ ies that group@@ ed for a moment to buy pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter is superior to buy a Cros@@ ley record players .
on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of panels of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ eh@@ ouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classi@@ cs , the essential panels for an average collection .
no one sees them - maybe because they are only pure decor@@ atively , some as far above that it is impossible to apply it .
it is pure &quot; panel art . &quot;
but in view of that every attraction for these items mean more money for the sector and some customers could send in the depths of So@@ cks for more , there is nothing to compl@@ ain about .
it &apos;s no surprise that a population group that has more time and money as others , also the one that is most suitable for luxury objects like plates .
even when my research shows that the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree that the results of You@@ Go@@ v are leaving , the large number of female collectors and record lovers that exist in reality , sheet business and online companies exist .
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
they spend their Thursday morning with security not with the st@@ roll through plate of the Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves through plates , while she resi@@ des the stub@@ born of an unusual , 30 @-@ year @-@ old moder@@ ator who rises not over the shoul@@ ders of middle ages .

French court re@@ jects on demol@@ ition of shops in the jung@@ le refugee camp
a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of pro@@ vis@@ or shops and restaurants in the jung@@ le of Cal@@ ais , in which thousands of refugees live .
during a trial , this week argu@@ ed the authorities to announce that the state should have jurisdiction over to sell 72 pro@@ vision@@ ally shops in which persons have been offering services or tea for 50 cents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in pro@@ vision@@ ing restaurants .
the Cal@@ ais pre@@ fecture are argu@@ ed that these places should be ri@@ dden down because they would be a parallel economy would be paid out of the tax and san@@ itation risk .
humanitarian groups divided the court that the businesses and restaurants are important since the free meals that supported by the nation@@ ally supported association and other groups , not enough food for growing numbers in stock .
they also led out that the provisional shops and restaurants often have accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there were no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who operate the 72 Pro@@ visional business , but have dre@@ amed that the concerns of the pre@@ fecture of Cal@@ ais &quot; were absolutely track@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that food stores , cafes and restaurants would be playing a much bigger role as people live &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; live in extremely pre@@ vent@@ ative conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that the areas of tran@@ qui@@ l points of refugees and volunteers offer .
one of the places that was threatened by re@@ mor@@ sel was the young Book Kids &apos; café of the camp , which is non @-@ profit and 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as an advice about asylum seek@@ ers for hundreds of protection requiring un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0,000 people signed the petition to preserve the kids &apos; Café .

here comes the En@@ forcement Trailer
Germany R@@ aser must adjust to the next generation speed sensor : in different federal states , among others in H@@ esse and Brandenburg , new fl@@ ashes are tested , which are particularly effective effectively .
the fut@@ ur@@ istic development En@@ forcement trailer of the Vit@@ ronic Company from Wiesbaden can be used for example on accident , where it would be a mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on highway construction sites or to renov@@ ating bridges , there are often no necessary infrastructure to provide there with a stationary ble@@ ach for keeping the speed lim@@ iting .
a permanent mobile device can be too dangerous or co@@ stly .
the En@@ forcement trailer is autonomous : its battery lasts five days and the case data will be transmitted via a modem .
in addition , all vehicles can be recorded simultaneously via multiple tracks .
variable speed lim@@ bs as well as passage of access to time , ride and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in the high @-@ driven state , one can move the trailer according to the manufacturer with each car with trailer hit@@ ch .
in order that it is not easy to use , it is lowered into the measuring operation , so that the wheels in the mo@@ red and can also disappear in the way .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system is to protect the Bl@@ itzer from V@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and now also used .
also foreign authorities fl@@ ashes with the new technique : recently , France has ordered 100 pieces , after an order of 150 pieces in the past year .
great Britain brings up silver in the 7 @-@ star Rug@@ by , after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold .
the impressive performance of Great Britain at 7 @-@ he Rug@@ by came in the final on Thursday evening to a ab@@ rupt change at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were defeated at the De@@ od@@ oro Stadium in Rio .
Fi@@ ji shared a master class in the handling , Side Step@@ ping , reverse , line and ro@@ cking force to win gold - their first Olympi@@ an &apos;s every color .
the defeat was reconc@@ iled by the non @-@ bad tro@@ ll@@ n price of the silver medal - Great Britain fourth on that day - and they could definitely be proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they struck New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the distinct defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ finals on the same day could fall back to the final .
but regardless of these Fi@@ ji have defeated a 15 @-@ man team in the form of this form .
it might be a consol@@ ation for UK - but it probably won &apos;t be - that at least one Br@@ ite tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben Ry@@ an , the former boss for England from Wimbledon .
GB had a difficult road behind it .
eight years ago she lost under Ry@@ an every game with the Adelaide Sev@@ ens .
they lost only one here .
this cap is done , but the progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji started wonderful and abandoned the GB@@ S attacks .
it felt at captain Tom Mitchell and Co. in , when you would run in running buses . the World Series winner went 5 @-@ 0 to top when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au went down in the corner .
with four minutes playing time , Jerry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack on the right corner which he walked .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly noticed the ball .
one of the t@@ ack@@ le t@@ ack@@ le of Mitchell stopped the mountain of Mann Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa a third goal but it has only stopped Fi@@ ji .
in the seventh minute J@@ asa passed J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a in the right corner a touch@@ down and there stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa inserted a new since the re@@ p@@ fi@@ ff and there was still over a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ breath@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ v@@ ou pre@@ f@@ ake through another weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
it &apos;s like Fi@@ ji also was born to play 7 , while the GB still has to be picked .
so it is also .
the GB introduced basic changes to the half @-@ time and ended the fi@@ ji@@ ic gap ... for all four minutes , which was good for the ratios of the first half @-@ time , until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova ran after a Br@@ illi@@ ant inter@@ play of Fi@@ ji .
Dan Norton started an attempt in GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went long in favour of the South Oss@@ et@@ ians , whose fans sang , flags and dance on the fun@@ eral .
it was not difficult to admire the play@@ ful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame set the i @-@ bag with another attempt in the last seconds .
the p@@ fi@@ ff past@@ ry , who pl@@ ung@@ ed fi@@ j@@ is and beaten up the GB in the lawn .
earlier on the day Fi@@ ji Japan had defeated Japan in the semi @-@ final with 20 @-@ 5 and the Great Britain pushed South Africa into a cris@@ py match from the race - Great Britain transformation of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks in the first half of the front , but Dan Norton started the line with an impressive foot and achieved a gate among the post in the second half .
a brilli@@ antly late Tac@@ os from Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team , secured the gain - and therefore the silver medal .
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning through fighting with the cancer of train@@ ee as a rowing win
there will be no emotional gold than for those games and that wants to be hot .
from the first stro@@ kes until the last , 220 hard h@@ ieve , enter into history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional significance in her golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even though it was only those who were sitting on the quiet , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the Train@@ ers Robin Williams , was always present to the second Olympic woman in a row , the first women in the history of the British Sports , who laid such a measurement .
its domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all her 3@@ 9.@@ ter was not permitted , which is also an exempl@@ ary .
what we see are two brilliant Athlet@@ es , which reflects about the surface with elegance of go@@ ose , refle@@ cting the way of the Arc de Tri@@ om@@ phe .
behind each gold in the ru@@ in , a Bat@@ ail@@ lon is able to contribute to the in@@ car@@ ment@@ ary progress that make the difference and it was no beneficial than the trainer , who would not survive this day at all , when diagnosed with cancer .
as he said he ris@@ eth .
I had bladder cancer that is oper@@ able and they did .
if you do not do it , he spreads everywhere .
it would have been quite bad situation .
it changes a bit of the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio has luck that it could be the treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , so that the inter@@ ruption has remained on a minimum , if it is the correct term under such circumstances .
I needed money , therefore we had to go back soon .
it was an incenti@@ ve .
I was in hospital and ran on the station around - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough .
so it begins .
the rowing is already a challenge , but it makes it even bigger .
in the in@@ sol@@ itude of the victory , their first thoughts on Williams went a nerv@@ ous morning to talk more than otherwise and tried to process his own fears .
St@@ anning , who was a cent@@ ur@@ ion at the Royal Art@@ illery Reg@@ iment in a bet in Afghanistan , &quot; I was a emotional wreck . that &apos;s perhaps somewhat extremely , but it means so much . &quot;
it only repe@@ ats that how much I and Helen and Robin have worked with Robin and Robin .
we were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
without Robin , we are no one , therefore a massive thanks to him . he is the best trainer in the world .
I don &apos;t have a better person for trainer or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have not lost a race over the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up .
even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to compos@@ e , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had a lot of reserve .
we were caught very at the moment .
Helen called &quot; stay in the process , lead in the process . &quot;
it &apos;s really important to let not take away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not to make something T@@ oll@@ es .
we wanted no fire@@ works today , we just wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race what we did .
the pair will take a break for one year before making decisions of his future .
Glo@@ ver has to appear on a wedding next week , their own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now it wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that that my last race was .
that would have a much pressure .
in London it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
that feels so much better , &quot; she said .
for 31 years the exempl@@ ary for clarity .
the managing director of the water @-@ purpose association &quot; V@@ eit@@ ing group , &quot; R@@ upper@@ t G@@ öller , is reti@@ ring .
the association is true as &quot; Bavarian far . &quot;
a small fr@@ ame@@ fully drinking water association as a model for the large waterfalls .
this means that some time ago in the origin@@ ality of Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk , it was called Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk .
a little later , the water Forum of the government of Unter@@ fran@@ ken sent the Zwe@@ ck@@ verband .
the work of the V@@ eit@@ ing group sailed &quot; Bavarian far as a exempl@@ ary . &quot;
after all this stands the Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who had been a member of the Zwe@@ ck@@ Federation for 31 years , 28 years as the managing director .
now he was retired at the age of 65 .
the drinking water association with seat in K@@ otten@@ dorf , municipality of Breit@@ brun@@ n , municipality of Breit@@ brun@@ n , promotes about 15@@ 0000 cubic metres of water annually and supplies 32 places and ham@@ let with about 5500 inhabitants .
member states are the communities of Kirch@@ einer , Breit@@ brun@@ n , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ach .
there are water supply agreements for further towns and communities .
the current chairman , Breit@@ brun@@ n Mayor , Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( FW ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was discontinued in 1985 as a waterfalls and was appointed as Managing Director of the Zwe@@ ck@@ Federation .
&quot; its tasks were very varied and they extended from water management and maintenance operations , the budget creation , lim@@ iting fees and contributions to emer@@ gen@@ cies on weekends , &quot; said the chairman .
as an outstanding event , she called the commissioning and inauguration of the new w@@ ells ( 1994 ) , the foundations of farmers in the area of the new fountain ( 1998 ) , and the re@@ organisation of a central computer control ( 2004 ) , the re @-@ creation of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the sub@@ development of water pipes .
there is no stand@@ still , and there are always new features , because water is going to cover and drinking water the most important food .
in her case of Lau@@ d@@ ati@@ o she praised g@@ ö@@ ll@@ ers , reliable and correct service over 31 years .
he has used himself with a lot of heart blood for his water purpose , and he has been living in the water @-@ purpose association as it would be his own company .
a few weeks ago , as a real practition@@ er , he was able to present the success concept of the v@@ eit@@ ing group to the nit@@ rate in front of the district Unter@@ fran@@ ken .
for this he has received much recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller had Alf@@ ons Alf@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked together with him for 28 years .
he is the best wat@@ ering and he was a faithful Kn@@ appe .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as a highlights from his point of view , he called the Brun@@ nen@@ bau and the restructuring of the Zwe@@ ck@@ verband .
but the largest challenge and the most difficult use were the pi@@ ping at the end of the church with Kirch@@ einer on 3rd January .
here , at minus 17 degrees all night will work through , so that the villages could be supplied with water .
also the supply of Neu@@ brun@@ n can only be stopped at once , because they filled the can@@ ister of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hat@@ ches .
the management of drinking water was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ gen , which took over from Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .

steel - Licht@@ blick for German steel industry
the chew@@ ed and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed from additional costs in millions of million@@ aire .
financial cris@@ es that are threatened by the industry , are made by the table .
in the liberation of Renewable Energi@@ es in the German steel industry , the Federal Minister of Finance , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , said the West German general newspaper &quot; ( WA@@ Z , fri@@ day ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m really happy that we could finally reach negotiations after two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the European Commission , the European Commission initially planned to use the steel producer , who use gases from the high furnace for power generation in order to ask for the cas@@ hier .
the steel industry threatened additional costs from 120 to 240 million euros per year according to the German industry association .
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , there is now a certification process with the EU Commission according to discussions with competition un@@ miss@@ used Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only if the generators be replaced in steel structures , all an EEG real@@ location is 20 percent .
but these will not be in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed the unification of Germany with the European Commission for stat@@ eless production .
this means that the status Quo of the existing regulation will largely be re@@ written .
this is the special meaning of the successful effort of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stahl &apos;s Future &apos; is that a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; more need to follow &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the IG Metall @-@ CEO Jörg Hofmann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel industry has been suffering from over@@ capacity and a considerable pricing pressure .
last year , the situation became further expanding , than the world &apos;s largest producer in China in view of the weaker domestic demand in steel on the global market .
European manufacturers t@@ oss Chinese steel contra@@ sted price d@@ umping .
over the course of this spring the situation changed slightly .
to a show , import duties to import steel effect , to the other , economic prospects have been suspended in China .
it is un@@ clear how sustainable the price recovery is .
on Thursday , the German Bran@@ chen@@ prim@@ us Th@@ yss@@ en@@ Krupp remained carefully on Thursday .
recently the prices had to be stag@@ n@@ ated .
the industry re@@ acts to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ yss@@ en@@ Krupp wanted not to close the closing works of individual works .
at the end of 2015 around 86@@ ,000 people were employed in the German steel industry .
in July the German steel manufacturers remain careful despite rising rates and increasing orders .
with 3.4 million tons , they produced six percent less cru@@ de steel than in the previous year , as did the economic association of economic steel on Friday .
after a short increase in May set the set quantity for the second month in a row .
since the beginning of the year , production has fallen by two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
the association ends in the coming months thanks to a improved order situation with increasing output .
community , spirit , health : sing senior citizen good
the singing has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp already accompanied her whole life : as young girl she was in school choir , in the teaching position . she s@@ ings the subject of music and today singing the 78 @-@ year @-@ old in a senior citizen .
&quot; singing - emotional and physical , &quot; describes them .
after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , che@@ er@@ ful , and a total of living , she says .
Inci@@ dentally , they do good health and their spirit good .
for singing is equal to several perspectives : a great hobby for seniors , Erhard H@@ ac@@ kler of the German senior league .
most senior citizens sing in choir and sharing the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
through the regular meeting , senior citizens can hold social contacts and maintain .
because frequently social and family structures at the age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in their choir : &quot; to arrange them and to learn to learn on the other and to learn from another - a choir is a very special form of the compositions . &quot;
can sing in the positive sense , H@@ ac@@ kler will sing .
because you are training a deep and controlled breathing .
he who calls his lung regularly , does not appear in everyday life as fast as the Pu@@ ste .
even though it comes to get the sound of the voice at the age , singing is an optimal hobby .
on older people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , Ursula L@@ enz says from the Federal Labour Community of Senior Citi@@ zens .
in the older generations the joint singing had a much higher level of job , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and leisure , explains them .
L@@ enz is often observed that singing or listening of songs by older people will wake up many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth .
through Li@@ ed@@ Tex@@ ts and especially melo@@ dies , people de@@ men@@ tia cardiovascular disease for long @-@ time events .
Moreover , in addition , the head is demanded a special performance , explains L@@ enz .
at the same time , on their own voice and on a given rhythm , to suit the other singers - this is a big cogn@@ itive challenge .
just older people who live alone , do not practice themselves to concentrate on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition he goes through singing in the choir , comments H@@ ac@@ kler .
an enthusi@@ astic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ est@@ e@@ em grows through the singing in a ch@@ orus .
to show yourself : if I have long enough for something , I will get better and watch over me - this experience strengthens .
good reasons to start with the singing , so there is enough .
whoever wants to test a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he believes , little talent , L@@ enz L@@ enz .
you don &apos;t s@@ ings alone - at 50 sing@@ ly people who list@@ ens to that if a tone goes beside it ?
in search of the matching offer , senior citizens have several options , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
s@@ ings someone from the old circle in a nurs@@ ing par@@ ench@@ man , you can easily connect .
many cities also offer views of the choirs in the vicinity .
he who wants to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or church leaders .
many senior citizens can also take place via the Internet .
if you do not have access to the Internet , the family , friends or neigh@@ bors can pray with the help of the Internet .
who will sing to sing , you should necessarily join a choir , en@@ um@@ ber@@ t H@@ ac@@ kler .
singing the soul well and has a good reputation - that applies to every age .
cats react sensitive as a k@@ ater to the k@@ itt@@ ens
bi@@ ologists have examined in Hanover , which effect the ruins of Kat@@ zen@@ bab@@ ys on adult animals .
in their surprise the Mi@@ di@@ gest also didn &apos;t leave the male - however , they stopped in the difference between the females always .
female cats can recognize the path@@ ogen of Kat@@ zen@@ bab@@ ys at the th@@ aw@@ n of the little ones .
they react by ten percent faster at Lau@@ te of k@@ itt@@ ens who chose themselves in great trouble according to scientists from the veter@@ inary Academy and the Medical School of Hannover ( MH@@ H ) .
males also react to the ruins of k@@ itt@@ ens - but still equal .
&quot; evi@@ d@@ ently the acoustic differences between the th@@ aw of less and strongly er@@ ated young for the males either could not perc@@ ep@@ tible , or not of importance , &quot; said the Bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding by the MH@@ H .
it is the first version of the study published on this Friday in the &quot; BM@@ C Evolution , Biology &quot; journal .
in a previous investigation , the research team had already found that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens were differenti@@ ated with the ur@@ gency of their help .
a total of nine adult male and eight que@@ ens were observed from the animal hus@@ bands of the MH@@ H .
they were played for a ru@@ in of little ones that were taken for three minutes from the litter box and separated by mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand , they were con@@ fron@@ ted with scre@@ en by stronger k@@ itt@@ ens which were additionally lifted .
the researchers keep their results despite the small sample for sa@@ w@@ ling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the females even those who had not had their own offspring , differenti@@ ated on the cry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it turned off faster to the speakers , when this Ru@@ fe played the very er@@ reg@@ teren k@@ itt@@ ens .
this ability may be born or develop in sex with the sexually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the male respon@@ ds to all , &quot; said the Bi@@ ologist .
in the past , scientists have already examined several times the reactions of women and men to baby care .
in fact , some studies showed that women re@@ acted to infants , as if they had already been mothers or not , the Bi@@ ologist Marina She@@ um@@ ann reported .
Po@@ dol@@ ski takes along with &quot; Gala &quot; to Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ kissed is a football legend in Turkey .
in Turkey , an arrest warrant was issued against the un@@ paved football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ kissed r .
he is accused to be a member of the terrorist group .
after the coup attempt in Turkey again an important football game takes place again in Turkey .
in front of the Du@@ eling of the Erz@@ ri@@ vals between Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as Istanbul and Luke Po@@ dol@@ skis Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul about the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual . &quot;
already in July , the government who would not imp@@ airs the everyday life of normal brush should not be imp@@ aired in July .
this does not apply to those who are suspected to belong to the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the coup attempt .
it is not made possible before the football .
against the former Star@@ k@@ icker Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver , the Prosec@@ ution filed an arrest warrant .

Sü@@ kul@@ r is supposed to be followers of the Pre@@ dig@@ ers Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Recep Tayyip Erd@@ og@@ an .
although the first for 90 days commen@@ ces the exceptional state until October . in fact , the life of the majority of the Turks actually has no effect as good as no effect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the n@@ igh@@ tly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy rally &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on public places in the country has declared Erd@@ og@@ an on Wednesday for end . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sports is - like the whole country - divided into tra@@ ilers and opponent .
fans of Arbeiter@@ Clubs Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as are traditionally not to the friends of the president .
but what &apos;s the goal of the Turks , however , faced with dramatic experiences in history , is the strict re@@ jection of military coup .
there are even the fans everywhere - no matter whether your heart be@@ ats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as .
at Pok@@ al@@ sieg@@ er &quot; Gala , &quot; it will be sure to arrive at St. Po@@ dol@@ ski again .
its sporty value in the past season pointed out in the past season : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first time as Top@@ sc@@ orer of his association .
in the final match against F@@ ener@@ b@@ ah@@ ce he achieved the 1 : 0 winner .
the newspaper &quot; Fan@@ atics &quot; celebrated him : &quot; he was the best on the place . &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured the t@@ rophy for his team .
thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record master had a conc@@ ili@@ atory conclusion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the Vor@@ rounds @-@ K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will become early in the Europe League . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Sü@@ per Li@@ g it was only enough to rank six .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we made it and this is the most important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as ran better the game year .
especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who set up with 26 seasonal numbers as an Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ rem@@ enk@@ ir@@ as , made the basis for the 14th title .
that &apos;s also the reason that fans hope to return to the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old hope .
yet , when the AC Florence had signed a contract and on Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as , he only announced the coup attempt to return to the country for the political situation in the country after his EM @-@ vacation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario would come to us , he must only say it &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; quoted the journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ icker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Club@@ director F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to this end , the stor@@ ms would have to ren@@ ounce to ren@@ ounce its annual sal@@ aries on approximately one @-@ third of its estimated 7.5 million euros in order to be clear : &quot; its content in Florence can &apos;t be paid . &quot;
d@@ oping : these athletes still have medals opportunities at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Just@@ in Gat@@ lin was closed twice because of D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Qu@@ an@@ owa can not start in Rio .
other super@@ vised Athlet@@ ics @-@ sinners can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio by medals .
the topic d@@ oping is determined according to the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics Games .
the Russian flo@@ at Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ owa , who had d@@ ump@@ ed off after a d@@ oping lock , was just shortly before the playing , was un@@ p@@ am@@ eless in their start ( 100 meters of breast ) .
it was a sc@@ ur@@ r@@ ile Sz@@ ener@@ ie : with a raised smile she was still in the hall and had prov@@ oked with their appearance .
as a festive , that they won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out into a tower of Jubilee .
but there are numerous other athletes who go to the start@@ up in the Rio Olympics in spite of d@@ oping past .
here is an overview :
Just@@ in Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old belongs to the most controversi@@ al figures in the Athlet@@ ics .
he had been locked to D@@ op@@ ings for two times ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
since its debut , the Olympic champion of 2004 and Ex @-@ World Champion won even faster than before , it is over 100 m in 9,@@ 80 seconds the number one in the world and is considered to be the greatest challenge of Us@@ ain Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / Jam@@ a@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champion had to be sitting in 2010 after taking the pain of the pain by Oxy@@ co@@ don .
after having had severe dental pain after surgery , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old def@@ ended .
Sandra W@@ kovic ( dis@@ cus / Croatia ) : in 2011 the Olympic champion of 2012 , world champion of 2013 and European champion from 2010 to 2016 has been positi@@ vely tested on the banned stim@@ ulus @-@ means of meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ ade@@ amine .
Per@@ kovic denied the ignor@@ ance and was closed six months .
the four far@@ th@@ est lit@@ ters go to the account of the big gold f@@ ishers in this year .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the Beijing Olympics champion and two @-@ time world champion over 400 m , was closed in 2010 and closed for 21 months .
a means to penis enlargement is responsible , eu@@ pon Mer@@ ritt .
this year the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has been over 200 and 400 m of the world &apos;s fastest man .
Ivan Ti@@ ch@@ on ( hammer throw , Belarus ) : probably hardly a athl@@ ete , so many medals were subsequently detected afterwards .
in 2005 , Ti@@ ch@@ on lost his World Cup title of nine years later , after he was diagnosed with testosterone d@@ oping .
the meanwhile 40 @-@ year @-@ old had to give the Olympic Silver in 2004 for ster@@ oid @-@ d@@ op@@ ings and the EM @-@ Title in 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
he was also recognized by Bron@@ z@@ em@@ ed@@ aille of the 2008 Olympic Games in 2008 due to a judgment of the International Criminal Court CA@@ S .
at 8@@ 0.@@ 04 m he is ranked in two of the World Ran@@ kings .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walking , China ) : the world record and gold medals in May was only tested in May , but may still start in Rio .
in the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion , references to the intake of a prohibited food supplement was found , the lock of the world @-@ anti @-@ d@@ oping agency WA@@ DA dropped mild and ran out on July 13 .
bomb error in Thailand - Austrian wounded - Sever@@ al dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand : in contact with woman , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas S@@ öll , Friday morning .
they had suffered ker@@ e@@ wounds and had been treated to the hospital , but have already left them again .
her hom@@ ebo@@ und journey is planned for early September .
whether of the further explo@@ sions on the holiday island Ph@@ u@@ ket and in the Southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ om@@ on , are still un@@ clear .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is standing there in permanent contact with local authorities , such as R@@ öll .
at approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital of Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in were first explo@@ ded on Thursday night in a quarter of two bom@@ bers .
according to the police a market in Thailand were killed and about 20 people were injured , among them the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
on Friday morning , two explo@@ si@@ ders went high , according to the authorities , a further human being killed .
Ph@@ u@@ ket was also reported in the morning a bomb explosion .
at the Det@@ onation in the vicinity of the popular Beach Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was viol@@ ated after police information .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , on the south @-@ eastern coast of the country , then explo@@ ded another bomb that killed a municipal staff .
according to the authorities in a flower set before the Re@@ four of the coastal police had gone into the air .
finally , Det@@ on@@ ations contained in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast as well as in Ch@@ om@@ on on the south @-@ east coast several injured .
there is a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , named it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bom@@ bers bear the same manuscript , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said army @-@ ener@@ al Dan@@ ai Crit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday to journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect it a coordinated attack &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is too early to express yourself possible for possible moti@@ fs - probably the works of Muslim reb@@ els .
also Thai media wanted to recognize a pattern among the attacks which is typical for the bom@@ bers of mus@@ li@@ ous separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police declared , the terrorist attacks did not believe in connection with the Islamic State movement or with international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sabot@@ age that limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one speaker in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is much rather , that the bombs of bombs were laid by fighters of the ruling military j@@ unta .
the authorities have kept confi@@ dential information in the past days of confi@@ dential information in the south of the country - however , they don &apos;t have been informed about the exact date and the places .
it is still un@@ clear that group behind the attacks .
the police reported to strengthen their officials throughout the country to enhance safety around important governmental buildings and airports , tourist attractions , restaurants and am@@ us@@ ement quarters .
there are still smaller bomb attacks in Thailand , but they are usually not against tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used over the years of Thailand &apos;s King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Austrian Foreign Affairs , recommends the Austrian Foreign Ministry on his website , to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities .
high level of safety ( safety level 3 ) sailed for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ iw@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah Vi@@ ges and its surroundings .
pursuant to disp@@ utes between security agents and Muslim populations , not necessary to travel to these provinces .
increased safety risk ( safety level 2 ) sailed for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday occurred few days after a controversi@@ al referendum on one of the military j@@ unta .
this dre@@ amed a military influence in the years over the next few years .
Jun@@ ta CEO and Prime Minister pra@@ y@@ ut Chan @-@ o @-@ CH@@ A said that bombs be an attempt to sti@@ ve chaos , while the country was moving towards stability , an improvement in economic situation and tourism .
the military j@@ unta , which had seized power in 2014 after a phase , holds itself , keeping the kingdom back to stability and order .
however , the military did not succeed in order to get the military insur@@ gency in the extreme south of the country for years in the extreme south of the country .
in the conflict more than 6500 people have already been killed .
almost a year ago , there were some 20 people killed in Bangkok at an attack on a popular Hin@@ du Sch@@ rein - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the most powerful attack of the younger history of the country .
the right &quot; Ident@@ ity movement &quot; is the vis@@ or of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection .
after several regional offices , the Constitutional Treaty marked the group under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see at the &apos; Ident@@ ity Movement &apos; An@@ nex@@ es for taxation against the freedom of democratic regulations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Constitutional Court Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate the German Press Agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
such being immig@@ rants from the Near East are diff@@ am@@ elled from the Near East .
therefore we observe the movement as well .
the &quot; Ident@@ ity Movement &quot; is a group of group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 .
it turns against &quot; Mul@@ tic@@ ult@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; un@@ controlled mass migration &quot; and the &quot; loss of own identity through overseas . &quot;
Constitutional Prot@@ ectors in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thuring@@ ia - observe the &quot; Ident@@ ity &quot; already .
Ma@@ arten said that his authority have been closely voted in the decision of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups like the &apos; Ident@@ ity Movement &apos; attempt to pick up their target group , where it stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Constitutional Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in general , extrem@@ ists try to discuss them with you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ iger music .
the day Islam@@ ists as the right @-@ wing Islam@@ ists as well .
this is not a praying advertisement for their own thing .
the prop@@ aganda should be emotional .
young people are in particular ways .
this is dangerous .
recently , it was given by several federal states over contacts of the &quot; Ident@@ it@@ aries &quot; to the Af@@ D policy .
Ma@@ arten said , that he did not know any in@@ sights .
for the Constitutional protection , possible contacts of this species only be relevant from a certain point .
it comes to whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain people who are extrem@@ ist , its target direction changes and so extrem@@ ist .
meaning that such persons contributed to the party .
that is not visible .
with a view of the significant increase in real @-@ time criminal off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugees , Ma@@ ate , he would not speak in that context to new terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we &apos;ve found it in recent years that it can be justified structures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Friday Group .
it may well be that further ero@@ y groups or small groups form , the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee camps , or attacks from other right @-@ wing moti@@ ves .
however , a German @-@ East or Europe @-@ wide control of law@@ gi@@ ve@@ ism is not visible .
the former groups were created on regional level or social networks .
just concerned , Ma@@ ate expressed that many sur@@ g@@ eries went to the account of people who did not occur in the right scene in advance .
this is the wor@@ r@@ ying .
many of the facts alleged in attacks on asylum . previously not known as crimin@@ als , political motiv@@ ated offen@@ ders or supporters of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people did not have a criminal law that had nothing wrong with jurisdiction , who were perhaps polit@@ ically in@@ different , or for example CDU , SPD or Left , who then have radic@@ alised themselves through the right @-@ right mood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is used for inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
not always determine the Olympi@@ ad or world records for the Olympic Games at the Olympic Games .
this shows the bra@@ ve appearance of RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te near the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
at the Aqu@@ atics Center , the lightly over@@ sized s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia is so slow that he could not see any more in the TV pictures .
it van@@ ished - no matter how far the excerpt was selected .
in the social networks , Hab@@ te became the vir@@ al Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old was completed with a return of 48 seconds and occupied the 59@@ th place of 59 starters .
but it was rather not his athlet@@ ic figure that went to the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still particip@@ ates in the Olympics ?
C@@ Ethiop@@ ian got a special issue of international swimming association .
this is distributed to swim in different countries .
as in Ethiopia most athletes run , Hab@@ te just wanted to do something else .
preparation is all : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly the first sur@@ names made the round .
some media recorded him as &quot; RO@@ B@@ EL of the W@@ al . &quot;
in reference to a &quot; bene@@ factors &quot; the English tab@@ lo@@ id &quot; The Sun &quot; made him fun with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; over him .
his time , he only defeated a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters of Free , did not play any role .
compare with &quot; Eric the E@@ EL &quot; were also drawn .
at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , the run of Eric Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i for medi@@ al attention .
unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ qu@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to compete in a screening over 100 meters of Free @-@ alone .
Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time .
the then 22 @-@ year @-@ old participated only eight months before the Olympia and had never completed a long distance before the competition .

crash@@ es - Bus non@@ slip in cr@@ um@@ m@@ ating : eight injured
in an accident with 43 senior citizens as passengers as passengers , eight people have been injured on Thursday at Kr@@ um@@ m@@ audi@@ n ( County Aur@@ i ) .
two of the occup@@ ants suffered severe injuries , shared the police .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to reach their data according to a opposite le@@ aster , which took part on the opposite way .
the bus came to the right from the road and sli@@ pped into a tr@@ ench , as an spokes@@ woman of the police Aur@@ I / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the location of the bus could not leave the bus independently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire brig@@ ade liberated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ance and a emergency car came to the state road 2 .
the final trav@@ ellers were brought back from a line bus to the cr@@ um@@ m@@ audi@@ ner district of P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ator asked the lor@@ ds and potential witnesses to report on the police .
the fees per cubic metre of waste water will be from October 1 , 2016 for the area of the se@@ wage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ fare € 3,@@ 44 ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / L@@ opp 3.@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 18 Euro ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the se@@ wer@@ age fee will increase once again , if corresponding improvement measures are necessary .
according to a relevant calculation , the se@@ wage price in Az@@ endorf will then be 4,@@ 37 euros per cubic metre .
as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported on the approval of the budget by the Land@@ rat and Kul@@ mb@@ ach , that for these se@@ wer@@ ies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Kas@@ endorf Market is oblig@@ ated to operate under legal basis to operate the facilities for free . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from October 1 , 2016 the citizens and the industrial enterprises from the Wel@@ fare , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to lay down deeper into the pur@@ se .
the fee increases between 48 and 67 percent .
like an administrative leader Herbert Schmidt on the board , a new calendar was necessary for san@@ itation systems of the market municipality .
over the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , overweight or under@@ cover@@ ings from the previous calendar period can be avoided .
with all three se@@ wer@@ ies , Schmidt founded that it was relatively small , with all three se@@ wer@@ ies , with a very low water he@@ ap@@ se , between 6@@ 800 and 12,000 cubic meters per year .
thus , due to the low distribution basis , for example , expenditure on repairs of several thousand euros would be engraved .
in addition , the se@@ wer@@ age should be slightly decl@@ ining in all three plants .
furthermore , in the past cal@@ cul@@ ation period , in all three systems , not least due to their age , san@@ itation and repair applications were incur@@ red in a considerable extent .
the plant in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ fare , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth , as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp nearly 20 years .
in the se@@ wage plant Az@@ endorf claimed that the mechanical ventilation system had to be exchanged due to a defect .
in the P@@ ump@@ werk Wel@@ fare , the nearly 20 years old conveyor systems had to be overhau@@ led by the ground and after almost 20 years of operation , the first @-@ hardness area had to be installed , the se@@ wage sl@@ ud@@ ge provides and an additional ventilation possibility to remain in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to these extraordinary expenses , the legal advis@@ ability and maintenance costs that are considered to be considered in the new calendar period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs which , in 2011 / 2012 , is still considerably below the current level .
stone houses clearly showed that at low water waste in the three plants the expenditure for the operation and maintenance . &quot;
in the past 20 years , Schmidt , the market town of big entertainment costs remained spar@@ ed at the se@@ wer@@ age in the past 20 years .
the situation for the mentioned plants will continue to continue to continue to the view of stone cottages , especially since you can &apos;t expand the supply area of the water area Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ acht@@ al to expand these systems because it is about de@@ fic@@ it@@ ous facilities .

snap@@ chat &quot; An@@ ime &quot; -@@ effect as Asian car@@ ic@@ ature
snap@@ chat says that this filter is inspired , but some observer saying that it is uns@@ en@@ si@@ bly compared to races .
with its filter tool , snap@@ chat enables roughly 150 million everyday users to change reality and play with identity in such a way that borders the ab@@ sur@@ d .
you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Licht@@ enstein paintings .
the filters are inde@@ struc@@ tive , independent offset tools that generate more than 30 million be@@ ats per day .
all failure to get to the public .
snap@@ shots filters have moved in the past cr@@ iti@@ que on itself , where they were accused that the App Black@@ face @-@ front@@ al or white skin would act as a beauty ideal .
when this week some users struck a filter , who gave them mud , false teeth , and wound p@@ liers , there are some critics critic@@ ized a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yel@@ lowing layer . &quot;
they asked whether these repet@@ itive contro@@ vers@@ y was referred to a larger problem that the company has di@@ vers@@ ität .
the messages and indig@@ nation were widely used on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Motherboard , a day after Snap@@ chat has said that it would have been disabled .
the company offered a exc@@ use : the filter was meant to be a tribute to An@@ ime characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but the out@@ sider who have experienced rac@@ is@@ sm@@ us , remin@@ ded the filter of infr@@ in@@ gement .
other ap@@ op@@ ted the anim@@ e comparison .
in an e @-@ mail , Grace as@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student , has been widespread over the photos , that the filter &quot; infr@@ in@@ gement and gel@@ inde was told un@@ pleasant . &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to ar@@ gue with the opposite of a very severe Asian carto@@ ons and the filter effects .
it shows that the filter is not yel@@ low@@ ish , but that the yellow @-@ layer is pulled into the Extre@@ mad@@ ness .
snap@@ chat is not the only company that cross this cultural tri@@ per@@ ate .
the American culture seems to be involved in an endless di@@ vers@@ y and integration struggle , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the equipment that we all keep in the hand .
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats big audience of young people - who are in the things as their older counter@@ player - could rather go out to expect sen@@ si@@ bility .
when one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats fil@@ tering a picture shows that such things is difficult for a user , &quot; so it is much more difficult that such things were un@@ noticed when it was earlier , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year K@@ atie Zh@@ u in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday , Zh@@ u decided Zh@@ u , who works as a product manager and engineering in medium to extingu@@ ish her Snap@@ chat account , and asking others to do the same .
in a call for medium and in a telephone interview they said that they believe that down @-@ related contro@@ vers@@ y a lack of di@@ vers@@ ity in the adjustment practices in Snap@@ chat .
Zh@@ u crit@@ ically critic@@ ised the major part white , just male leadership , and ended its set with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; either , they don &apos;t have any various representation of people with other skin colors , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Zh@@ u , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that are working there , but not in positions , in which they are safe or safe to say about it . &quot;
other parts of their opinion , a complaint , the snap@@ chat has mostly left un@@ answered .
the company does not publish figures on di@@ vers@@ ität of its workforce and refers to its status as a private company .
on Thursday , there is Snap@@ shots to discuss the cultural back@@ grounds of his staff , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company recently decided to concentrate a staff responsible for focusing on population groups and on internal integration situations .
Zh@@ u said that she will be closed her Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I ask myself if they need more users like us to say that this is not O.@@ K. is . &quot;
military leadership IS@@ IS Secret Services Committee , unveil@@ ing Committee of Congress
during the United States Central Command , the United States Central Command has changed his detailed picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria as it had allowed the actual states of Congress in a report on Thursday .
the provisional report , compiled by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can members of the Armed Forces , secret service , and the military bud@@ get@@ ary , reported by great dis@@ satisfaction at Central Command Secret Services , which reported , expressed their in@@ ass@@ ess@@ ments to the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , shortly C@@ enc@@ om , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida to control the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; news service information , which were typically released by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com Commander , had regularly allowed a report from the American efforts towards terrorism , but were consistently positive than analyses of other news services , quoted a newspaper article published .
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is un@@ acceptable - our soldiers have to be presented , if bad analyses will be presented to our political leaders , Ken Cal@@ ver@@ t , Republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives .
the guide error in Cent@@ Com is sufficient for the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces .
although there is no direct remarks that government peaks under Obama have given the reports , shows how an@@ alysts were exposed to the pressure from their predecess@@ ors , a more optim@@ istic image of the threat of Islamic state , also known as IS@@ IS or I@@ si@@ l , too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 many Central Command press releases , comments and statements before Congress was clearly positive than the facts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Cent@@ Com was announced publicly that a military re@@ conquest of Muslims could already start in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , second largest city of Iraq , remains under control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigations , it is much clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , republi@@ can convention from Kansas , in a position . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the mid @-@ year 2014 to the mid @-@ year 2015 , the tips of Central Command changed the first @-@ to @-@ use reports to run the risk of IS@@ IS in Iraq .
rep@@ ublic@@ ans called the Task Force to life after giving them , an@@ alysts were wor@@ ried about the man@@ ipulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will continue to be completed by more detailed knowledge during the investigation .
additional investigations of Cent@@ Com reports are in addition to the General Insp@@ ection of the Ministry of Defence in the G@@ ange .
Democratic members of the News Service Committee published its own findings on Thursday that coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com created a super@@ bly reduced trial for the creation of en@@ rol@@ ment en@@ rol@@ ments to I@@ si@@ l and Iraqi security services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the highest peak of democracy in the Council of the House of Represent@@ atives , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a member at the House of Represent@@ atives Adam B. Schiff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this process , such a ship , &quot; delayed the release of con@@ scienti@@ ous obj@@ ection reports , &quot; the moral under an@@ alysts and &quot; delivered little space for different opinions . &quot;
but Mr. Schiff took and the Democrats agreed to have no indications on a intervention of the White House at Cent@@ Com an@@ alysts , regarding a &quot; certain political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the Congress were published on Tuesday through &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported investigations through the Pentagon &apos;s General Insp@@ ector , which were recorded after complaints from Cent@@ Com an@@ alysts .
Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a press brie@@ cher of the Pentagon , announced that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the Congress , during the investigations of the general @-@ spec@@ ul@@ urs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also gave me that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts sometimes quite di@@ gest opinions concerning the interpretation of complex data , and that the news services and the Ministry of Defence welcomed a controversi@@ al discussion of this important issues of national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investigations have reported feedback on the question of a successful air campaign in Iraq and Syria ( a claim that is made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) .
however , due to the alleg@@ ations of last year , President Obama had abandoned the question , to what President Obama can rely on Central Command for military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya , and other crisis regions .
the cr@@ iti@@ que of criticism of the Islam@@ ist state over the Islamic State recall some more than ten years ago , as an Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , as the former government of many an@@ alysts only saw a small crew of occupation in Iraq and to make a little time on the consequences of the invasion of 2003 .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the insur@@ rection against the current reporting on the Islamic State .
last year , the team around Mr. Hoo@@ ker asser@@ ted that contrary to the government &apos;s government proposals , we have had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , since these pro@@ vision@@ ally refin@@ eries had taken into operation in order to sell oil on the black market .
but this realization was not published , reported the Times in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ s commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legisl@@ ature for a hearing before the Senate for a hearing before the Senate .
General Austin went into retirement in April and was replaced by the Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the US win fourth match in the field of hockey women , a show@@ down with Great Britain .
one day after they had shot three goals during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates for the American field ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games should actually show a memor@@ able performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said that she could not recall it ever done .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I am not one of the people who keep their gates in memory .
however , it knows : the Americans are in the olymp@@ ic competition at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are equal to the British in their first place , which are un@@ defeated after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday at the last round of the first round .
both teams are already qualified for the quarter @-@ finals , the game will decide which the two teams will play in the first and second place within their group of six teams .
the first @-@ placed first @-@ fin@@ ed will go a little longer from the road to lead the other group .
as always the game may go out on Saturday , the Americans triggered a surprising host through their success story , four years after they landed in the previous London Games at the last of 12 seats .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania and had the first time with three years a hockey bul@@ let in hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years , she became a national player in the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
they missed the Olympi@@ ad in 2008 because they could not qualify for the k@@ ader .
then came the year 2012 , in which for her and her team everything going to shoot .
in the following year , Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , a Engl@@ ish@@ man , trainer of the N@@ ation@@ alt@@ e@@ am , started to make things better .
&quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a body change , &quot; says B@@ am .
we did not have the work of work in London which we have now .
we complete the rest of the ruins .
on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the cake in the first half of the game with a return from the Middle East .
India had gone without victory in the tournament , but the team was sur@@ pris@@ ingly tough and kept the game of 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter , until B@@ am the game took into their hands .
she completed a Sprint with a flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved to the middle and laugh@@ ed the ball into the gate to create a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of all the tournament for the keeper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had to pay a goal in each of the previous games .
she has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a good position &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the heart of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the tramp@@ ol@@ ines Zen
wherever you are , even as late it is , the Olympic Games are .
the events in Rio de Janeiro are durable and in@@ sof@@ ter , a rapid relay between competition and streams .
it is because the Olympic F@@ ack@@ el itself would be a burning rod , which protects from bracelet to s@@ wimm@@ ers to the Turner for the tri@@ athletes .
you can &apos;t turn the television to listen to a newspaper or listen to the conversation of your neighbours in the waiting @-@ long in Coff@@ es@@ hop , without via Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ aders or the dispute between Michael Ph@@ el@@ ps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there are Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a female of women with dimples , could well be sent under these known names to be sent to Prime Time , built by sponsors and well @-@ being @-@ TV advertising if he would be a s@@ wimm@@ ers , Turner or even F@@ real .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fought in the Olympic tramp@@ ol@@ ines in gold .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event .
further from the centre , in part in the shade there are sports , which are not widely accepted : air pist@@ ol shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ w@@ ondo .
we will always have the chest and may rule it long .
but if I should make a modest arguments for my defined dar@@ ling , then let me write the attention to the dis@@ crete charm of the tramp@@ ol@@ ines .
although the tramp@@ ol@@ ines have already been a Olympic event since 2000 , when it had his debut in Sydney , it was the last 16 years so bad that I had asked , did not know that there is a Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ art at all .
this could also be regional Ig@@ nor@@ ms .
although the United States won athletes for competition , it has never won a medal in tramp@@ ol@@ ines and had gained a athletes until 2012 , who made it until the end of 2012 .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to divide the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadian women to share for women .
Dong Dong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal in London this year .
the tramp@@ ol@@ in@@ jump has a certain exterior lateral , partly because it sounds for the un@@ checked ear for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ school than those who sounds for the Olympic Games .
in this spot I should ad@@ mit that I &apos;m not an expert , but only a little enthusiasm .
it has hum@@ orous potential - the cart@@ ograph@@ ical trem@@ bling of its never to end @-@ like squ@@ alls - but also the Gra@@ zie of the turn@@ around and dive , the two sports , which combines it basically .
the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means so much means &quot; j@@ umping board . &quot;
the winner jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot nearly up to 30 feet into the air and must take a number of falling movements ( turning , tro@@ t and sal@@ cars ) before being landing at the feet .
according to the report , they are evaluated according to the version , Diff@@ icul@@ ty level and &quot; flight time . &quot;
two @-@ seater athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete in Rio against each other .
the common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts will continue in their stre@@ ches after gold , faster , upward and above , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes and back , back to the top and down on the playground .
they won &apos;t just hunt the finish line or the starting wall , but in the TV broadcast also another cav@@ ity destination : the world or the Olympic Games .
the goal @-@ oriented stre@@ ben is Nobel , ad@@ mi@@ red , even fan@@ atic - and it &apos;s enough to stir even a viewer &apos;s tears .
but it &apos;s also what I think when watching these games like a little tired .
there@@ for , the trampoline offers a bra@@ pl@@ ause .
the V@@ ektor of the tramp@@ ol@@ ines centre is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
he or her pr@@ ays , seem@@ ingly heavier as a ast@@ ron@@ aut , goes upward , then to the top , then effortlessly back to the top .
there is also a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during practice there is no h@@ ec@@ tic attack on the target , no wol@@ ves in the distance , just the dre@@ aming , elegant termination of time and gravity .
it is so Zen as the contest for the Olympic Games can only be .
the qualifying and final wounds of the women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time , and the men on Saturday also at 13.00 .
N@@ BC will exu@@ de the final time as part of a afternoon block on two days from 14.00 .
in the middle of the Olympia Man@@ ie they promise a quiet , nice moment , one who is likely to see in general tum@@ ult .
if the consciousness can only be reached by the attacks and the object ti@@ fication of male athletes - how to beat the male US Turner at the The Wall Street Journal recently - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey awaits its air @-@ round , new fan community .
&quot; a generation protest &quot; in Ethiopia , Long , in the United States
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators , demand political changes in Ethiopia , shooting on violent resistance to government .
witnesses say that only prot@@ ectors are killed during cl@@ ashes with the police in Sch@@ uss@@ change .
is Ethiopia straight doing so ?
over the past ten years , it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid national economy with a rapidly growing economy .
but in the last months , protests against the government had struck the country and far spread themselves in more areas .
last week , thousands of people stor@@ med in the streets and fundamental political changes .
according to human rights organisations , the answer of the government was un@@ mer@@ ciful .
witnesses testified that polic@@ emen had shot and killed thousands of un@@ armed protest@@ ers .
in circulation , videos are on the protests that are probably from the last or beginning of this year , show how security professionals have forced to make young people with st@@ alls , while these were forced to make a stand against a wall .
the head of the UN High Authority for Human Rights now demands a detailed analysis .
&quot; it was always difficult to agree on this land and future , it &apos;s even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group .
Ethiopia is the most populated country of Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
American military and secret services collabor@@ ate closely with Ethiop@@ ians to combat terror@@ ists in the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , when at all , get so much Western help .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded in a resp@@ ectable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new comm@@ uter in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
the roads are generally quiet , safe and clean .
even if Ethiopia was anything like a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continued to continue the op@@ pression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted , and dis@@ sidents were brought effective to silence .
many were sent into exile and put into prison , or pushed into the wilderness of the wilderness .
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you supp@@ ress people and they don &apos;t have other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Se@@ as@@ m Tes@@ home &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a lecturer in central Ethiop@@ ian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the entire youth protest@@ ed .
a generation protest@@ ed .
there are numerous complaints , which cover everything from the ground use to the appreci@@ ation of the rain coalition , in regard to the power of the rained coalition .
after a broad@@ ly critical election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last registered office of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament .
at the same time the st@@ resses desc@@ ends along the border to Erit@@ rea ; a fight for these z@@ ag , controversi@@ al line ur@@ ged in June hundreds of life .
analy@@ st fears that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , which could en@@ forced more or less , the tur@@ bul@@ ences could take off and could be armed .
several factors explain why feelings of desp@@ air after years of age can explo@@ de under the surface .
the first seems harm@@ less : Smartphones .
only in the last few years , many Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate with the social media , as cheaper smartphones were always more common and improved to the Internet services .
even if the government has access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do in regular intervals , mostly with prot@@ ru@@ sts , many people can still communicate over internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide themselves .
several young Ethiop@@ ians gave to that they were so @-@ assembled to protests .
the second factor is that there are more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two major eth@@ nic@@ ities in Ethiopia .
Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
since apples of all prosp@@ ering the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from Ethiopia , mainly Christian high @-@ countries , in politics and economy , while they live the Oro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are and live in flat areas .
but this also changes .
&quot; we are involved in coordination under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos .
the largest protests were held in the areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , which accounts for around 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military , in the service and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former re@@ bel leader , was up to his death in a non @-@ public disease in 2012 , 17 years of Ethiop@@ ians , and prime minister .
he was viewed as a tac@@ tical gen@@ ius , a man that could think about corners .
an@@ alysts predi@@ ct that it was especially toler@@ ated in it , to perc@@ eive early signs of un@@ satisfaction and to use special atten@@ dant to work opponents and make them un@@ harmful .
&quot; the present regime is missing in this basic course , &quot; Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st .
Ethiopia , new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen out of relatively un@@ transparent reasons to take the position of Mr Mel@@ es .
other than Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of Northern Alps , Mr H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south .
analy@@ st say that it is not enjoying the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many people fear that the result will be more bloo@@ d@@ shed .
the last time that Ethiopia had been such an u@@ pro@@ ar in 2005 , after thousands of elections protest@@ ed according to the details of analy@@ tics apparently from the government and then stolen .
during the subsequent ra@@ ids , many protest@@ ers were killed , even if it were less than in the last months and that time of the un@@ rest went relatively rapidly .
experts &apos;s experts for their visionary infrastructure plan , as well as the new comm@@ uter train , as well as for their meas@@ ur@@ able progress in poverty .
but apparently this has not prevented the inten@@ tions of the internal dis@@ appearance of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and she takes a dangerous ethnic form .
last month the protest@@ ing in Gon@@ dar , a am@@ har@@ ic city , by Tig@@ ray guided businesses and hat@@ red opposite the Tig@@ ray will always exercise in the social media .
analy@@ st say that protests around the United States and other Western allies bring to a separate position .
the American government used Ethiopia as a base for D@@ ron@@ en@@ arians over the neighboring Somalia , even if it has recently healed that it closed on this basis .
while the West wants to support democracy , he doesn &apos;t want to pull his ally in a vol@@ at@@ ile area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saying , Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin free hike . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his asser@@ tion Obama was founded IS@@ IS &quot; Sar@@ cas@@ us &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump attempted to scatter the last contro@@ vers@@ y that his campaign puts his campaign that his multiple re@@ claimed asser@@ tion , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the Islamic State of Islamic State , not seriously .
this clari@@ fication designed new questions about the communication capabilities of the presidential candidate of the Republi@@ can , whether it is clear and under@@ stand@@ able to communicate with the American public .
it also brings his mit@@ ri@@ ans that ende@@ av@@ our to take him during an event@@ ful phase in protection to explain which he could not have meant .
after he had made the assum@@ ption of a campaign event on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump committed referring to the claim on Thursday and insi@@ sted on Thursday that he really does not int@@ end to signi@@ fy the president and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS .
but in a morning native to Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump , he was simply excellent .
contrary to the previous day , Mr. Tr@@ ump said that Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a number of interviews , he thought that he was entirely serious .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ oder@@ ator Hug@@ h He@@ wit@@ t wanted to help us@@ her , the statement weak@@ ening to destroy him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy the Republi@@ can Presi@@ dential candidate in nothing .
the last storm of criticism of Mr. Tr@@ ump down to Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he tries to direct his campaign to the economic situation due to its campaign .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton held spe@@ ech@@ es about the business situation in Michigan in this week .
on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this subject again .
talking about Twitter , he war@@ ned that Mrs. Clin@@ ique would lead to higher taxes , and that he has found long speech bor@@ ing .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m at his defense .
at the end of July he went down a strong cr@@ iti@@ que on himself when he meant , Mrs. Clin@@ tons of emails , but he explained later &quot; of course , I said the sar@@ cop@@ ic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the language limits in politics and return to demand as required .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are taken from his fans as they arrive , and then , if &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declare &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on how the reaction is gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication experts who observe the language of both candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I think he is smart enough to stop his testimonies , so that they can interpre@@ t it in different way .
instead of the tone to shar@@ pen the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has accepted an even unk@@ enn@@ ess sound because its conversion rate passed away .
a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was published on Friday , showed a lead with a large margin in the Federal States North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado , and a head @-@ on @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump generally tried to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative post@@ ings , he charged his critics to understand his statements or to understand his hum@@ or .
but while he has strengthened himself in the focus of the attention during the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps Scher@@ ze had brought up his lo@@ y@@ als Mit@@ stre@@ ite into the un@@ comfortable situation to have to stand to him whatever the pro@@ voc@@ al will like his statements .
Rud@@ olph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ um@@ ps famous inter@@ c@@ ession , gave great efforts to defend the candidates today in a CN@@ N interview from Thursday .
&quot; I believe what he says are legitim@@ ate , political comments &quot; says Mr. Giuli@@ ani , so he said to the correc@@ t@@ ness of Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps declared whether Mr. Barack Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State .
it is true in this sense that IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organization that he called them back @-@ ben@@ kler , completely wrong , and therefore it happened , because he moved the troops from Iraq .
most ma@@ inst@@ re@@ am rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to ar@@ gue that Mrs. Clinton served as an Foreign Minister , it was IS@@ IS allowed to spread out the situation in the Middle East , aggressive under control .
before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump dropped his attacks on the media and threw it to them on each of his words , and against him vo@@ re@@ engineering .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he mo@@ cked the &quot; poor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; TV experts who try to understand him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you cannot believe it ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the Democrats sp@@ ott@@ ed over Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps exc@@ use as a further evidence that he is not suitable for the presidential office .

there are more native people as the last loss in a genet@@ ically significant city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ t wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is Change , but I can still believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and Ver@@ b now has a soap store . &quot;
but if New York change is , then it is new .
a revi@@ ved Ver@@ b Cafe open the last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new land@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepted cards , but still some of the same staff and a similar atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long @-@ year employee of the old cafes , the owner and managing director of the new caf@@ és .
he began working in Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end of the year .
when a customer offered to provide money , it was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ guez , 36 , retained a lot .
ver@@ b the same distributor for excav@@ ations bought the same es@@ presso machinery .
it even uses the same lamps from the old ver@@ b .
but Rodri@@ guez said that he wanted to experiment with them .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu are sand@@ wi@@ ches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are gar@@ ni@@ es such as cap@@ ers and s@@ aut@@ é onions .
there are natur@@ iss@@ ks resident .
the café is no more beer , there are fresh ju@@ ices .
after nine months , Rodri@@ guez said that he noticed a st@@ ating power of the old family .
&quot; many old clients were also pushed out through William@@ sburg prices , &quot; he said .
recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was a client of such customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived earlier in William@@ sburg and visited the ver@@ b regularly .
even after she had moved to Green@@ point , she would take the way to itself .
after that the ver@@ b had closed , she gave a while on coffee , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was clear that it was in the coffee and the culture under the ver@@ b which pleased me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now they drink coffee again , even if it appointed a bl@@ ended C@@ hai Tea that was later on that day , another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long @-@ standing and faithful client since the beginning of the Ver@@ b in 2003 .
he went there before work and he ordered in@@ sof@@ ter the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came off after seven , every day , as a Swiss pocket watch and they prepared my Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment and record new ingredients in the menu .
nowadays Ros@@ enthal gets still his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ guez said that he did not beat any more coar@@ se that the soap business has taken the old business area .
in fact , the propriet@@ or of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie is to produce a special soap for ver@@ b with the cold @-@ lock coffee of a coffee machine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will be back on their offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ guez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional , Polish inhabitants Green@@ points have also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated the menu to the Polish Polish and Rodri@@ guez , that he has prepared to present them soon , so that his new neighbours will feel welcome .
the site also has further advantages .
a native Saf@@ t@@ locally wants to fill the cold @-@ filled coffee into bottles and sell .
there is a chance that the café is expanding into a neighboring building .
for many customers a new ver@@ b is enough to get their old favorites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a pedi@@ atri@@ cs and said that he was destroyed at the ground than the café closed .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that the bed and ordering a new coffee is felt like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; I had to smell it , &quot; he said .
the de@@ pri@@ ming food of the economic crisis in &quot; a rich meal &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his asc@@ ension to President Franklin Del@@ ano Roosevelt took his lunch in the Oval Office .
as fine alarm , President Roosevelt is a F@@ ai@@ ble for sophisticated delic@@ acy of Fifth Avenue , such as P@@ â@@ te de Fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland water tur@@ tle soup .
his menu on this day was a bit modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , potato m@@ ashed potatoes and as dessert a pl@@ au@@ ding p@@ ud@@ ding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man .
her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans that they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food hist@@ ori@@ ans .
Co@@ es last book &quot; CH@@ OP Su@@ ey &quot; provided by the Chinese cuisine in the USA , while drawing in their book &quot; 97 Or@@ chard &quot; has told the life in a residential home in the Lower East Side of the food perspective .
her latest co @-@ operation , &quot; An independent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity , as they meet with a repor@@ ter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sandwich Shop for dinner , a small , gra@@ b snack in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been on business since the stock market in 1929 .
brick , 54 , ordered a cream cheese with Oli@@ v@@ enst@@ ück@@ er , while Co@@ e , 57 , Tru@@ th@@ ahn with potato pur@@ ée and vegetables .
when the repor@@ ter ordered Hack@@ ney , this was the pair for a discussion about the food in the era of great depression .
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; said bricks .
it gave pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were prepared from a ingredient and some cheaper that extends the access .
imagine a lot of pe@@ an@@ uts to eat that they serve them as a dinner .
CO@@ E grin@@ der .
&quot; it must have been in the stomach as lead , &quot; he said .
in the years before great depression was the table in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of women bo@@ iled for male Feld@@ worker and it was served in fresh@@ ly b@@ aked past@@ ed past@@ ed for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there were the Americans to star@@ ved Europeans during the first world war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; records the ways of which the country went with it , no longer to be har@@ ass@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time , in the food for the Americans , a central , donated issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e , why he and his wife would write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new Bud@@ get@@ Di@@ et was just pre@@ ten@@ sion@@ ed : mysterious dishes such as bread and cass@@ ettes have been presented to basic food , the c@@ asserole , as a &quot; wonderful way , Ess@@ enti@@ re@@ ate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saw the appet@@ ite in@@ appet@@ ite ingredients under a cle@@ ver sauce . &quot; &quot; &quot;
fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dr@@ y@@ ob@@ st .
meat that had been the heart of the American kitchen was to become a rarely ser@@ rated luxury .
strange mixtures were tried , as a cal@@ orie rich and nour@@ ishing satisfaction was preferred before taste or even healthy kitchenette .
during their research for the book , which also encomp@@ asses recipes , bricks prepared a dish from this ep@@ och , b@@ aked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a popular supplement for lunch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zi@@ egel@@ mann moves on : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and b@@ aked onions doesn &apos;t match each other .
it was typical for many of the house@@ keeping concepts .
as never before or ever since , household management - including Louise Stanley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 @-@ 1943 - the eating hab@@ its of the country .
by taking the recipes and articles in newspapers and journals , they made women to become &quot; budget commitment &quot; and the challenge of trans@@ forming P@@ amp@@ e such as cre@@ amy sp@@ aghetti with carrots in delicious meals .
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a celebration of historic treat .

while he publicly conf@@ essed the simple I@@ owa farmhouse in his kitchen , he sp@@ ouse with the billi@@ on@@ ous man of the world where he became .
&quot; he mo@@ cking Continental kitchen such as fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber , &quot; Co@@ e .
he ate in an almost gilded living room and wore a Smoking .
he was del@@ ight@@ ful realistic .
President Roosevelt would perhaps have committed the same fault if his wife did not ask him to stat@@ u@@ ate with his stomach .
as described in the book , the aim of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flav@@ ours by Ms. Roosevelt told that the White House prepared the slow food in Washington , but also one of the most expensive food ready . &quot;
many of the species from the era of great depression , to deal with food , was rejected when the country returned to the legs .
the legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food , they said brick , as well as research on food .
in writing by writing the book the eating hab@@ its of Zi@@ egel@@ mans &apos;s mother in law was better understood - for example , how they couldn &apos;t throw food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; brick rec@@ alled : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she actually made people sick &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were the wind flow .
after the plates were evacu@@ ated at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they moved and Co@@ e had seen a dessert that she had prepared at home : the pl@@ ott@@ le , the President Roosevelt to noon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man and added that it was a usual trick to miss a good name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were no extra cream , only pr@@ un@@ ms , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone who di@@ pped slightly will@@ ingly has a spo@@ ons in the teeth , brown gli@@ b@@ ber .
it was not so bad .
CO@@ E repeated three times a night .

in bombing attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he set his own life to help others : Khal@@ ed Omar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed Omar had dedicated his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ed everything to save their lives .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died itself with an anti @-@ bom@@ bed attack against the Assad regime .
Omar was a member of the &quot; White Hel@@ mets , &quot; a civil society group that had saved nearly 60,000 people according to the picture of the newspaper .
29@@ 00 volunteers use their own life to draw people from the bom@@ bed houses and aff@@ ord to make the first help in the war zone .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
Omar was the face of the group : a video of the civilian , which shows him in a 11 @-@ hour rescue of a babies from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrians to the brilliant symbol figure in the grave of war .
but as heroes , he has never seen himself , said he said : &quot; for me is the real Ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I die to save life , I think that God sees him a mart@@ yr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before Omar himself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bomb attacks in Syria .
the helicopter have been cast four façade bombs over the Alz@@ adia district , one was filled with chlorine gas .
one woman and two children died , seven people suffer from respiratory need .
&quot; we now eliminate the po@@ ison@@ ous remains of the bomb , so that no children are playing , quoted the picture of his last words before He died .

Greenland : the oldest cycl@@ one is nearly 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland &apos;s surface usually come to the surface only in the winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board of the S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and swim with a 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland can only get offspring after 150 years .
formerly floating of the Greenland on the ground of the North Atlantic crossing , in an hour he comes from an average of 1,@@ 220 meters .
when it depends on it , the five @-@ meter @-@ long animal accelerates to a full 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a Rob@@ be .
but this lon@@ el@@ iness of lon@@ ge@@ vity seems to be a sponsor@@ ship for a high age .
Julius Niel@@ sen conducted by the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues in the journal &quot; Science &quot; in any case of a Greenland , 3@@ 392 years old .
&quot; mad@@ ness , &quot; commented Alexander Sch@@ eu@@ er@@ lein of the Max Planck Institute for Dem@@ ographic Research in Rostock , this life span which means a world record .
indeed , the ev@@ olu@@ tionary conver@@ ges already suspected that Greenland will be st@@ ony old .
only lack@@ ed the evidence .
Greenland is difficult to observe and ultimately , in the Eis@@ meer , they live mainly in the polar sea before the thin min@@ ished coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ b@@ ard .
because it prefer@@ ed water temperatures of six degrees Celsius , dive on the surface usually only in winter .
researchers have correspon@@ d@@ ingly looked according to the lifestyle of Greenland &apos;s lifestyle .
their era emp@@ t@@ oss them , when they were six animals in front of S@@ val@@ b@@ ard , with a transmitter .
spoil these shar@@ ks : in the stomach of a animal , researchers found the remains of a Rob@@ be , another one had swal@@ lowed up the pine bones of a young iron .
maybe they hunt them sleeping animals or pat@@ ro@@ ls at the bottom of the ice @-@ sea and look for Kad@@ c@@ asses , from higher water @-@ layers according to the bottom .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland hair@@ s , who took fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in Greenland or S@@ val@@ b@@ ard .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cm long , while the largest 502 @-@ centi@@ meter measured .
to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the lens core with the carbon @-@ 14 method .
this centre of the eye lens is already produced before the birth of the shar@@ ks , which contained therein later no more .
the two smallest shar@@ ks had a lot of carbon @-@ 14 in the lens core .
their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s , when nuclear weapons attempts to deterior@@ ate the atmosphere of this radio@@ active carbon in the atmosphere .
with 220 centi@@ metres of length , the l@@ entil core contained a low surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from nuclear weapons , it is likely to celebrate its 50th birthday with its investigation in 2012 .
in their lens core they had a normal carbon @-@ 14 quantities that arises through cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the Carbon @-@ 14 clock showed an age of 335 years for a 4@@ 93 centi@@ metre long Greenland , while the record shar@@ k is likely to be 392 centimeters .
that Greenland female had only been post@@ pon@@ ed when they are longer than four meters , it was known .
now the researchers were able to arrange a age .
since one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably stood at the threshold for sexual imm@@ atur@@ ity and at the age of 156 years , Greenland @-@ hair@@ y can be seen at least one and a half centuries .
this should also be the world record for verteb@@ rates .
that such methane car@@ es live primarily in icy waters , is no co@@ incidence .
also the previous record holder , a 211 @-@ year old Greenland , on the neck of the neck , a 120 year @-@ old har@@ po@@ on tip , was caught on Alaska .
through the low temperatures there often also the organ@@ ism of living animals living on savings .
so you mature later - and al@@ arms slower .
in order to keep warm in cold water , the animals often are particularly large .
because the volume is much faster than its surface due to the pet &apos;s heat .
the heat loss of a gram of mouse is therefore much larger than a gram of elephant .
another advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal is therefore more dangerous and should focus on that as possible as many descendants as possible , &quot; the ev@@ olu@@ tionary biolog@@ ist Sch@@ eu@@ er@@ lein . &quot;
a very large animal should have to invest his resources in a long life .
building site in double pack
with subjects around the building , the Municipal Coun@@ ts in the youngest meeting was concentrated in the most recent meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with relief , the board adopted the notification of mayor Robert P@@ utz , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally the marketing of the most recent residential areas can commence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
the City of Main is therefore in the competition with Paris , Dublin , and Luxembourg the best chances to move jobs and companies from London .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt am most benef@@ ited from the Bre@@ x@@ it vote , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , leader of the Compet@@ ence@@ d financial markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is un@@ certain whether banknotes have to operate from financial transactions across the EU .
so far the EU pass for the so @-@ called EU pass , the authorisation has been given for them in Britain .

in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) have declared their headquarters , but this is less significant in the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; the proximity to the point of music is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder .
in Luxembourg , a large fund industry led by a large fund business , but as well as Dublin as well as Dublin for its infrastructure .
Frankfurt am clearly easier to reach the main airport thanks to the big airport .

&quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder .
in addition to the Seine the rent for first @-@ class commercial real estate grew by 50 percent higher than the Main .
in Frankfurt , Frankfurt also bi@@ ased a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure and less crime .
in a ranking of the corporate consultancy Mer@@ cer stand the city on No.@@ 7 , Luxembourg on No.@@ 19 , Dublin on No.@@ 33 and Paris at 3@@ 7. place .
even if life quality is a question of pre@@ ferences : &quot; with its strong position as a financial centre for the European inland market , Frankfurt may attract other banks and investors , &quot; fol@@ ds the I@@ W .

Clin@@ tons earn 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal taxes
on Friday , Hill@@ ary Clinton released its tax statement for 2015 based on the Democrats and her husband an income of USD 10,@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , the Clin@@ ics earned USD 1 million for charity purposes , mainly to Clinton Foundation ; the former President Bill Clinton generated revenue of USD 3 million by the publishing house Simon &amp; Sch@@ uster for their book on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Clin@@ tons is candidate for vice @-@ president , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine , Virginia , published together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton , his tax returns the last ten years .
they paid a effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to continue with respect to financial transparency , &quot; by Clin@@ ics Kamp@@ agn@@ enh@@ el@@ fer@@ in J@@ enni@@ fer Pal@@ mier@@ i .
in a small contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump hidden behind false reconciliation and re@@ trac@@ ers in terms of his previous promises to publish his tax returns .
it is common to publish their tax ex@@ cre@@ ations for the U.S. presidential candidate , although they are not obliged by the law .
Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers as the reason for his ref@@ usal to have a control test by the control authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Clin@@ tons candidates in Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter with regard to the publication of the presidential candidate in the demo@@ c@@ rats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ um@@ ps Special Consult@@ ant said to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to release something before the control tests are not finished .
Tr@@ um@@ ps critics , among others also the Republi@@ can Presi@@ dential candidate of the Year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already abandoned that his ref@@ usal questions regarding wealth , his donations for charity organisations , his business and various other connections , particularly with Russia .
Clinton has already over@@ thrown onto the topic and will be published on Friday a video on the Internet in the high ranking Rep@@ ublic@@ ans Tr@@ ump to publish his tax return .
on Thursday they spoke also the subject to the economy in Michigan also during a speech to the economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ref@@ uses to do what each other presidential candidate has done for decades in recent decades and publish its tax returns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said too much . &quot; &quot; &quot;
polit@@ ico has reported that Tr@@ ump paid no or only very low taxes during the 1990s , and an economic journalist for the New York Times quoted a number of tax ha@@ st@@ ables and tax ad@@ visory services that could still be the case .
Bundes@@ taxes are turned into a theme in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a control that is named after billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren buff@@ ets which would ensure that people pay more than USD 1 Million des@@ erve a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during a election event for Hill@@ ary Clinton in the last week in Omaha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away Industri@@ alists &quot; has his seat to exchange their tax returns .

Clin@@ ics campaign has published tax return back to the year 2007 .
the Clin@@ ics , which now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid for an effective federal tax rate of approx . 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0,5 % .
the tax statement by the Clin@@ ics from 2015 showed that these only USD 100 of their income as a reward , unlike the majority of all Americans .

Jewish Director broke down in Berlin because Israeli pre@@ fix was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; Inv@@ itation to &quot; Arab . &quot;
a French director with Jewish roots allow a media release after he had betrayed the Bristol Hotel in Berlin against Israeli pre@@ fix since there would have been an Arab schol@@ ar according to a staff . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of Hol@@ oc@@ re @-@ documentary &quot; Shoah &quot; left his anger in the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by playing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay Lanz@@ mann had attempted to find Israel at the country @-@ voting list of the hotel .
however , the country was not listed between the countries which can be accessed directly from the hotel room .
how is it in the year 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new part of Germany , that Israel elim@@ in@@ ates and cleared Israel ?
he wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol offers an opportunity to choose Israel over an own call center instead .
looking for a declaration , the director looked at the hotel reception .
the answer which he received there , &quot; sho@@ cked him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel indicated that the measure was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason , which stood behind , dissolved in the director even more rage .
&quot; the majority of our guests are Arab@@ s and they have demanded that the pres@@ election will be deleted , &quot; the employee of Lanz@@ mann was quoted .
the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ des @-@ Handels@@ man called it a &quot; great confusion , &quot; covers the South German newspaper .
we were horri@@ fied and dis@@ ma@@ yed by this event .
this is really very sh@@ ame@@ ful .
the fact that this happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even greater confusion .
that no explanation requires any explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right conclusion &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident revealed a quite big reson@@ ance on the Internet , where people called the whole sc@@ and@@ al .
some of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel , some of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel revealed that it had been given to the alleged estim@@ ation of Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ashamed of you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in another article , in which it was pointed out that the hotel , which is located on the no@@ k Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , close to a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hotel quickly dra@@ fted all the alleg@@ ations of himself and called the incident &quot; and &quot; exc@@ used &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , &quot; Der Spiegel reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct instruction &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Israel does not record into the fast video list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung a spokes@@ man of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it adds that the country code is now added .

trade between Russia &amp; Iran rise suddenly to 71 % - RT business
with the abol@@ ition of the sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trade between Moscow and Teheran in the year comparison rose by 7@@ 0.9 percent .
since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted up , the interest in Russian companies grew strongly on shops in the country , divided the ambassador .
Russian companies take existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to provide access to the market .
of course , the further priorities of the bilateral cooperation is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan .
he noted that the trade rate between Russia and Iran during the first five months of 2016 was 7@@ 0.9 per cent compared to the same period in 2015 , and $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , the Russian imports increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent , and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran increased 16 percent to $ 158 million .
the merch@@ ant was reached by ship@@ ments of machines , land vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the ambassador .
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan runs for this year from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
last year , Russian foreign represent@@ ations issued around 35,000 Vis@@ as , primarily associated with Reis@@ ev@@ is@@ as , on Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 countries that affects the number of tourists in Russia .
we could say that the record number of foreign tourists in Russia will be broken down from the last year , &quot; he said .
at the same time , only a few Russians attend Iran , something , from which the Ambassador hopes it will change that it will change .
&quot; I personally can visit the visit of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , who received the monuments of the old Persian civil@@ ization in a good condition , &quot; he said .

the ministers from the sea level of Ey@@ oc@@ al @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the road to Freiburg on a four @-@ day pilgrimage of Vill@@ ingen to Freiburg .
four stages have been overcome .
in order to over@@ look the period up to the next round trip of all ministers in two years , the Minister @-@ ten@@ ded round St. Anna decided to prepare and conduct a multi @-@ day pilgrimage .
various wallpapers goals were tested and one decided to finally meet for the Epis@@ cop@@ ate city of Freiburg , where this year on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , the Mer@@ cy of Mer@@ cy on the Frei@@ burger Münster was a special pilgrimage destination .

Scot@@ s@@ ote Call@@ um Sk@@ inner stor@@ ms home , when Br@@ ite Gold for wheel sport
Scottish Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ra@@ ste last night in the notification team spr@@ int in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio to fame , when the British team def@@ ended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow had taken the anch@@ ors who had made his survey@@ ing Sir Chris Ho@@ y , and he made the legend proud to enter into his home country around a victory of the favorites new Zealand .
England claimed four years ago a sho@@ cking victory , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympi@@ ag@@ ol@@ d@@ med@@ ail@@ len .
they repeated the trick after they took place in March at the World Championships in London despite the back@@ stage of Ho@@ ys only a modest sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as an execution .
Ho@@ ys retired a gap that tried to close K@@ ian Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ ampton .
Sk@@ inner was the man who stayed when they saw the potential in the sh@@ all@@ ots that now fold it up .
Hin@@ der , Kenn@@ y - who won four years ago with Ho@@ y winner - and Sk@@ inner sat in qualifying rounds , but in the stand@@ still winning the New Zealand st@@ alls in the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
after his round , after his round , Kenn@@ y brought the team to the front and the inner .
a strategy change made a major component of transformation from the execution in a higher gear to slow it down and it &apos;s Kenn@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y looked at his position as a BBC expert from his position and dropped Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der , when they climbed to the podium .
the 23 year old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow had said : &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot;
I &apos;m only here to do my best and to make me a name .
we set up an Olympic champion in the final round and defe@@ ating the World Champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win .
after the triumph in 2012 on the page Kenn@@ eth and Ho@@ ys there was hin@@ der that he dropped to the railway after a weak start .
he moved this statement later and there was not an appeal of England ri@@ vals .
with such a superior victory there was no such problem this time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; hin@@ der said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels like London with all the GB flags on the grand@@ stand as London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we came together in the last three months as team .
we are so bad for so many world titles so that it was amazing again at the Olympi@@ ad .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , who won seven of 10 titles both in Beijing and London .
if that is a barometer of our progress in the past five months , we expect this successful five days at the Vel@@ od@@ rom .
in the shape of the case , it is in the field of Pos@@ sible that he won the Ho@@ ys victory of three Olympic gold medals in a contest .
this would be exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was born exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y ( apparently most important date for British sports ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster was born ) - an yield of six gold medals and a silver medal .
the boxes of Ho@@ y equal .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the Sprint , which starts today and will go over three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 year old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I enjoy it for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels quite easy to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; hin@@ der said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he wins two more gold medals he should be beaten to the K@@ nights &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only med@@ alli@@ on competition of the day , but there was another good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ ve W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll quali@@ fies the fastest performance in four @-@ four @-@ kilometre race .
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 942 at the destination .
the world record , which won gold in London in 2012 was 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 659 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the contest , with the W@@ ig@@ gins with safety .
yesterday he had disp@@ uted yesterday with evidence of the qualification , when he called him to measure his height .
in the respective female competition , the tomorrow continued and finished , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ av@@ ie in world war period in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the GB team leaves his strong rail team to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a pair of medals .
after a truly remarkable representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio were driven down .
it played drums in the background , so the re@@ sign@@ ation of the technical leader Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April in the midst of Sex@@ y and Mo@@ b@@ b@@ ing@@ fen , as well as the retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria P@@ end@@ leton .
but if one sees the first evening of the competition at the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks quite different when the legendary reputation GB@@ S , which reached the perfect moment its cli@@ max .
future of the melt of Portland by repe@@ al of the energy consumption
the future of the Aluminium melting of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ stations - are standing in the game because the system operator will termin@@ ate the energy supply contract and thus raising all delivery contracts like the supplier of energy companies .
this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsi@@ dies to be granted .
a payout for a period of 20 years will be made in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the AL@@ CO@@ A plant in Portland are standing on the game .
not less than 2000 work@@ stations -@@ direct and indirect - could be at risk .
in addition , it could come to domin@@ o@@ effects , since the melting is consumed by around 10 per cent of total electricity generation Victoria .
in 2014 AL@@ CO@@ A joined the Point Henry melt , which led the last year at a closing of the Angl@@ es@@ ea force .
the melt of AL@@ CO@@ A in Portland loses money and ris@@ ky a closed lock .
this step follows the years of lon@@ gl@@ ass@@ ations regarding the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the power price for the plant .
AG@@ L that the large aluminium melt with his Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley shared that it assumes that three additional owners will termin@@ ate their contracts .
the plant is in the majority owned by a joint venture of AL@@ CO@@ A and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p smaller shares will hold smaller shares .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland , which means a further physical demand for electricity through the melt , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; distributed the company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L still said that the contracts so called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; securing transactions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should have entered into force since November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tre@@ aties have a 12 month period of notice , so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of this , AG@@ L assumes that the tre@@ aties in the financial year 17 will contribute to the revenue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impact on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by forecasts of strong current markets for wholesale electricity prices .
AG@@ L told that it had already written down the value of the Tre@@ aties at the amount of $ 187 million in &quot; expect@@ ation of a cancellation &quot; written .
AL@@ CO@@ A said that the decision to make the tre@@ aties to operate the &quot; Sk@@ ill Al@@ co@@ as ... the melt or the power to the melt , &quot; not imp@@ aired .
the US company said that in 2010 it had completed a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , who would have entered into effect from November this year , even if there is still a declaration , why it has re@@ signed from the contract .
analy@@ st due to the bad economic conditions in the industry prior to the possible closure of the Portland melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near Newcastle .
in reference to the statements of the analy@@ st at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Portland will consume around 600 megawatts and Tom@@ ago around 900 megawatts .
if both plants disappear from market , this would mean a considerable reduction in demand on &#91; electricity market &#93; .
and for us as generating sets , that &apos;s not good , &quot; he said .
more than just a kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an reality TV star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September issue of the Vog@@ ue
K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of Man@@ ag@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ enner C@@ lan@@ s Kr@@ is is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the US Vog@@ ue .
K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der is and at Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York announced the news on its Inst@@ ag@@ ram account on Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people who I love , brought me the sight of this cover to weeping , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the unveil@@ ing of the Co@@ vers followed a bizar@@ re game ( or simply con@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ th@@ hi@@ an family ) , which shows the whole kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an On@@ k@@ els and producers of Ke@@ eping Up Ry@@ an Se@@ ac@@ rest ( except for the cover of their sister and ends with a classic background : you have all planned a surprise @-@ party .
that &apos;s the kl@@ ee@@ ee@@ zing hand almost every birthday party of a kinder@@ garten ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the proposition that we had forgotten you ? , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon animation on a broadcasting place at 8 am ) , but Kr@@ is had to let her own girl somehow participate in this Public@@ ity .
with regard to the September issue of the Vog@@ ue , he started a new era of Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans .
K@@ end@@ alls big sister Kim likes them what the Vog@@ ue Cover will be beaten ( they and her husband Kan@@ ye West were going to see in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself .
the September issue is for Vog@@ ue the most widely sold edition of the year .
with a circumference , rather resem@@ bles a picture band than a fashion magazine , the issue attrac@@ ts a large number of advertising @-@ bet@@ ting ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista ) , the 8@@ 32 pages of the roller ( 615 pages of advertising ) .
the unveil@@ ing of his Co@@ ver@@ stars is expected to be ad@@ dic@@ tive in the last two years of the magazine still before the official announcement of dis@@ closure .
women who were already on the cover , Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Moss .
in recent years there were clearly more &quot; celebr@@ ities , the Mod@@ ules &quot; as &quot; models that are celebr@@ ities &quot; on the cover .
Oscar @-@ Prize lau@@ re@@ ate and Di@@ or @-@ brand ambassador J@@ enni@@ fer Lawrence was born in 2013 on the cover , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
but even at low chance that Mr@@ s J@@ enner - described by the magazine as the &quot; endurance model &quot; of their generation - under the previous category , it is located in good company .
these celebr@@ ities are not related with famous people or reality stars or you@@ ths of today who know how to wear a good snap@@ chat video ( even if everything is in denom@@ in@@ ator ) .
they are really talented women who draw out in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had the publication of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of their career .
of course J@@ enn@@ ers do not like success every one .
with their reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ ers was always a bit tight in the fashion world .
in June , the lon@@ ging Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ Modell Steph@@ anie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ enner and her col@@ leg@@ in Gig@@ i H@@ adi@@ d and called them &quot; the mist@@ ak@@ age of the moment . &quot;
this feelings of boiling f@@ ails again , when the message was coming out on the Vog@@ ue Cover .
but on the mis@@ alignment it seems to be att@@ ested at the point .
K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vog@@ ue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
she runs for Marc Jacobs .
it makes advertising for your footprint of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
you and all their sisters sell your pictures from themselves on their respective Pay@@ wall Apps .
you sold pictures from Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds daughter to the magazine LO@@ VE .
and in their leisure time she is to see in reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .

Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation without repe@@ aling the government &apos;s decision would only be worse .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land community centres are chron@@ ically financed , meaning that thousands of people of important services you need to be rejected , &quot; he said .
people who are violent relations , people with ir@@ rig@@ able and impressive debts , families who have been dismissed by separ@@ ations , workers who have od@@ d problems - all these people have problems right @-@ wise kind and this survey that they could not get the help you need them .

the third place is fought between the left and the Af@@ D .
the left boxes came to 19 percent ( previously 18,@@ 4 per cent ) , the Af@@ D would be with 19 percent for the first time in the country .
the gre@@ enery ranges despite a slight losses of 6 percent ( previously 8.7 percent ) again in the sever@@ ity of the country .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP are not represented by 3 per cent in the country &apos;s day .
in the Berlin member of the Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties , the SPD gained only 23 percent of the survey ( 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) .
the CDU reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
this was still the green by 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would be at a member of the Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties with 14 percent .
with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could return to a return , the pir@@ ates would miss it in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
E @-@ mail and Internet in Tim@@ el@@ upe : the Nokia Communic@@ ator has been on the market 20 years ago .
the successor domin@@ ate the world - his manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the tool weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as difficult as an iPhone 5 .
it was th@@ icker and larger , it was not good in the hand .
on the contrary , it was rather kno@@ ck .
the built @-@ in memory at the beginning of eight Meg@@ abytes , this would be enough for about two rare cases with high resolution .
an iPhone is now supplied with at least 16 gig@@ abytes .
the &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; came exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , into the business - and it was the first smartphone .
for a couple of Euro lovers can still buy the equipment on the internet , but they come from the Stone Age of the Internet .
but 20 years ago , the Communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone maker had announced the product a couple of months previously at the C@@ eb@@ it computer fair in Hannover as &quot; Office in the Western Design format . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent and received a lot : SMS and emails sent and received , also by fax it was the Communic@@ ator .
even the access to web pages was possible via HTML browsers , even qu@@ eri@@ zing slowly .
a calcul@@ ator was available , an digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone was similar to a laptop .
then there were a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
very proud was the price : 2700 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 Euro .
the average price of a smartphone in Germany was € 392 in 2015 .
nobody could do in August 1996 that the Communic@@ ator would be the beginning of the smartphone era .
ever since then everything is different .
the smart phones are a success story , although not for Nokia .
the mobile map of the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented design , was finally sold to Microsoft .
the market today rule the provider that were all much later than Nokia .
ever and everywhere , that is today for very many people everyday life .
in 2015 there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide .
sold , about 1.4 billion units , on Samsung and Apple , of which 555 million units were sold alone .
worldwide sales with the equipment is around 400 billion euros .
these are the well @-@ running business of the paid app providers and t@@ elecommunications accounts .
all the industry has grown around the Smartphone .
at the beginning of 2007 , the decisive breakthrough towards the mass market occurred at the beginning of 2007 , at that time , Apple &apos;s boss announced the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones .
he promised three tools in one : a music player , a phone and a Internet communications , all by touch screen easy to use .
the winner of the Apple began today , the iPhone is the most important product of the group .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market , had the afternoon .
they finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the ship now have Apple and Asian vend@@ ors like Samsung .
after his invention , the Smartphone is a self @-@ understanding 20 years after his invention .
on average , each German has now looks on its mobile phone 88 times a day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must learn all of them that smartphone is also going away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , responsible for staff in the Siemens Board of Personal Information . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true as a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must extend the olymp@@ ic spirit and bro@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row is not only available in our local municipalities and throughout London , but throughout the country renewal and prosper@@ ity .
for me , it represented the biggest attraction in He@@ ath@@ rows , just as in 2012 in London , when we run a large effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benef@@ ited from the games .
the Olympi@@ ad brought great benefits to Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and we will again be able to create new possibilities for local residents and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
for our local communities alone , we are already able to create 10,000 new jobs , 40,000 new jobs and youth unemployment in the airport environment .
as they were ahead of 2012 in London , there will be such that the challenge of enlargement of He@@ ath@@ row is too large .
I was said that England never will be ready for the games and that we will present ourselves on the world stage .
the two fl@@ aps in 2012 had wrong and they will also be wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ ath@@ row answers any matter .
like the Olympic Games is He@@ ath@@ row for many and not for individual a infrastructure project .
expansion is a way to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion to swe@@ ating growth and a legacy of skills and employment for both the airport and to the whole of GB .
we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has been implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investments in time and budget , from T5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal until T2 , which was built in the middle of the two frequ@@ ented cat@@ walks in the world .
now they are ready to supply a third running cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion to private investments .
the London Games of 2012 were a great success for UK and I &apos;m confident that the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row will also be one .
it &apos;s time to extend this olymp@@ ic spirit and He@@ ath@@ row , as well as to our future trading and create a legacy of skills and employment , to be proud of England .

add @-@ on Plus , Facebook in &quot; K@@ atz @-@ and Maus@@ er &quot; on display block
for companies bringing money online money according to one of the software manufacturer attempts to handle advertising block , a &quot; catar@@ act and mouse game . &quot;
on Thursday , just two days after Facebook announced that it would block placement operations on his desktop side , ad@@ block plus a blo@@ g@@ post , in which it said that users could update their filter in the program to block advertising in the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook announced that his desktop side would change the coding in regards to its advertis@@ ements , in order to recognize the display of advertising , which part of the page is advertisement to be difficult .
but Ad@@ ad announced that it has found a new way to handle the new codes .
in a blo@@ g@@ post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams , that &quot; this kind H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her @-@ Stru@@ g@@ gle between the Pres@@ ent Open Source Community and the Um@@ actors already exists since the invention of sco@@ re@@ ers in the G@@ ange , &quot; and that Facebook is soon coming with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest company has left the fight in the fight , is a strong indi@@ ces for this , how real@@ ise ad displays have become the industry .
according to a study conducted by Pa@@ m@@ air and Adobe &apos;s last year , some 200 million people displays sco@@ op@@ iers ; almost four times as much in 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billions of active users active on Facebook , access@@ ing Facebook on their mobile devices , Hand@@ y@@ wer@@ bung accounts 84 percent of advertising recordings .
the company has no effect on display monitors to desktop PCs , because mobile displays have no effect on fac@@ eb@@ ooks mobile app for the social network and inst@@ ag@@ ram , a speaker divided into account .
advertisement on your desktop PCs makes a sufficient amount of revenue , such as Facebook appears to be paid as worthwhile as worthwhile .
on Tuesday , Facebook announced that it would update its &quot; display reference tool &quot; to find out more control of advertising about it .
on Thursday , Facebook claimed that add@@ ile new filters would be wor@@ r@@ ying because they would block contents on the page that are no advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for users , there is no positive experience , therefore we are planning to discuss the problem &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a spokes@@ person from Facebook in an e @-@ mail communication . &quot; &quot; &quot;
displays recor@@ ders are a dum@@ b means , why we are concentr@@ ating on developers such as Ad pre@@ ferences to put more control into the hands of people .
woman with suspected self @-@ suicide on Swiss Highway
the sacrifice was in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police call witnesses after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday with suspected self @-@ suicide of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident happened on the A1 nearby Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
a woman placed in the Dun@@ kl@@ en &quot; in an act of desp@@ air &quot; on the streets and were hit by several cars , the police spoke in Vau@@ d .
it is obvious that a Swiss woman at the age of 49 , which was passed by several vehicles , including a load car , wanted to kill himself .
she died on site .
several drivers have already been taken , but some have not been identified , the police informed these and every witness of the event .
it was opened an investigation on the basis of a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter before Le Tri@@ bun@@ e de Gen@@ eve .
however , it remains to wait if one of the drivers will be displayed .
was a cl@@ ash avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something what the prosec@@ utor must decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that the driver will not be moved to responsibility .
in each of the two cases - where one person ran in the Dun@@ es on the fre@@ eway - it was decided that motor@@ ists don &apos;t want to go out in the middle of the night on the fre@@ eway as it was in the newspaper .
last year a polic@@ ew@@ rit@@ er was acquitted of the negli@@ gence after she had killed a man and killed one night at the A1 near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old sacrifice had drunk , and has become conscious of the road , and took the court .
the court found that the polic@@ ew@@ om@@ an -- that had answered on a emergency call -- on a justified manner , and that the presence of a man on the road was a &quot; completely extraordinary and un@@ predic@@ table situation , &quot; says the judge .
everyone who has further information regarding the incident on Thursday near Morges , should report on the police under number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA Klim@@ am@@ od@@ ell : Venus was once more hab@@ itable
according to the proj@@ ections of a new NASA climate model , Venus was likely to be inhab@@ itable .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of the Venus on the basis of tools and algorith@@ ms that were similar to those of clim@@ atic resear@@ ches .
the model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ density atmosphere could be detected in similar conditions .
scientists have previously pointed out that the slow revolution of Venus could be explained by its density atmosphere .
but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , similar atmosphere and slowly but slowly .
the model illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably pointed out more dry regions than the Earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to give life to life and protected against rapid evap@@ oration .
early Venus also benef@@ ited from the sun , which was 30 percent matter .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS @-@ Modell@@ simulation , the slow revolution of Venus provides their daily site of the sun for almost two months , &quot; declared G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release .
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer of clouds , which works like a rain screen to sh@@ iel@@ ding the surface of a large part of the solar heat .
the result are average temperatures , which are some degree cooler than those of the earth today .
the model brought a history of the Venus , which the evolution resem@@ bles that previously assumed by plan@@ etary guides .
although it was presumably mainly hab@@ itable , the Venus was exposed to much heat and ultra@@ violet light over the course of several billion years .
her oceans evap@@ oration and her water vap@@ or was burned down from ultra@@ violet light .
when her Hydro@@ gen dropped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide , with a dead@@ ly greenhouse effect -- the Venus as we know it today .
the researchers distributed the results of their new Venus climate model in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research AG .
Patrick Roy coming as trainer of the Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy coming back on Thursday as a trainer and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey operations of the Colorado area and led to a low @-@ determination in the team &apos;s decision @-@ making process .
alternatively , President / General Manager of Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will prom@@ pt@@ ly look immediately after a new trainer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last three years , I have met my duties as Head trainer and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations of Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determin@@ at@@ eness &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy was expressed in a position . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I thought in the course of the summer long and much about how I could improve this team to give it more depth to give it a higher level and bring it to a higher level .
to achieve this , the Vision of Trainer and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations must be perfectly matched to the organization .
he must also have a determination in decisions that affect the performance of the team .
these conditions are currently not met .
Sak@@ ic , who had been hired as Roy on May 23 , 2013 , was than@@ ked to him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; Patrick has informed me today about this decision , &quot; said Sak@@ ic .
we all appreciate what he did for our organisation and wish him only the best for the future .
Roy was honoured during his debut season at the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as winner of the Jack Adams Awards , winning the best trainer in the league .
he led the association to 112 points and on the first place in Central Vision but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the Play@@ offs of Minnesota and pas@@ sports in each of the last two years the night season .
the Aval@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand in the 2015 season and fell behind the Wild for a second Wild@@ card Spot in the Western Conference back five points .
as Hall of Fame Tor@@ wart , Roy won four Stanley C@@ ups -- two pieces with Montreal Can@@ adi@@ ens and the Aval@@ ok@@ che .
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ öl@@ worker take talks again , continue strike
the working strug@@ gles regarding the re@@ mun@@ eration for northern oil workers are subjected to the table and set up all parties for a new meeting round at the table , saying the negoti@@ ator guide .
stri@@ kers against the oil field service provider Wood Group were carried out spor@@ adi@@ cally on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to begin the winding process of the current battle , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is expressed in a common statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will hold some full @-@ day meetings in the next few weeks , starting at the beginning of next year to re@@ use the problems .
the unions said that their last strike , who is the first in over 25 years , a protest against potential wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
this year , Wood Group has reduced the rates to its contrac@@ tors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s rating is followed by a 10 percent reduction for on@@ shore contrac@@ tors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts in the company takes the required area to come across the market down@@ turn .
Shell has released for its part of thousands of people and announced plans to impos@@ e its oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries , as a result of its mass activities as a result of his meg@@ ac@@ us@@ u@@ els with the British Energy Company BG Group .
energy companies are based on lower cru@@ de oil prices under pressure , a economic situation which was strengthened by the decision of the British in June to leave the European Union .
the Scottish parliament of Parliament Dave Anderson met in the beginning of this week with workers &quot; leadership to discuss one of the greatest working trials which took place since a generation in the North Sea .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; in the North Sea and all the country we need a business that works for many and not only for few , &quot; he said in a statement .
in 2016 less than $ 1.4 billion will be expected to spend new projects in the North Sea in comparison with an average of about $ 7 billion in the last five years .
Kepler measures rot@@ ational rate of stars in the star cluster of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Kepler Wel@@ sh teles@@ cope had helped astronom@@ ers to collect the complete catalogue on rot@@ ational rates under the stars of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades .
the new data can help the astronom@@ ers understand why stars in star cluster at different inst@@ al@@ ments as well as in which context the rot@@ ational periods of plan@@ etary teeth stand .
&quot; we hope to learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at C@@ alt@@ ech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the star cluster of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades is located in the 445 light years from the earth .
many stars in this constellation , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ th@@ ood .
you are now fastest in the fastest .
this stri@@ pe @-@ stars encounter great quantities of star win@@ ches .
since the winds are through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a slow effect on the stars .
when a star alter@@ t , its rot@@ ational rate begins to slow down .
Kepler measures the rot@@ ational rate of each star@@ ring by recogni@@ zing the time between the appearance of a recogni@@ z@@ able ster@@ ity -- as solar spot@@ ted -- .
the latest catalog of rot@@ ational rates indicate that a more massive star slow@@ ed slower than a few massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with larger stars slower Pi@@ rou@@ ettes as smaller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ballet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors to be massive to be massive , while faster rot@@ ors have ten@@ ding to be very bright stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reb@@ ull said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the star cluster of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic lab to compare different qualities such as rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; the star cluster of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades has an anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
it is still much ahead of us that we would like to learn more about how , when , and why stars are dis@@ slow@@ ed down their rot@@ ational rates and so to speak their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and their colleagues have reported in detail on their latest analysis of the repet@@ ition rates of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades , which soon be published in the astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversi@@ al bas@@ eball Star
tears run by Alex Rodri@@ guez qu@@ icker than the US bas@@ eball Star in the best days of Base Base .
following his emotional feedback , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old professional will take place on 12 August against the T@@ amp@@ a Bay R@@ ays last time the trio of his New York Y@@ an@@ ke@@ es .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &apos; Good@@ b@@ ye &apos; to both the &apos; goo@@ d@@ ye All @-@ Star Game Particip@@ ants of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) .
three times Rodri@@ guez was elected the most valuable players in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Y@@ an@@ ke@@ es .
his signature among a tenth year contract granted him a yearly 27 million US dollars annually since 2007 .
until the end of the contra@@ diction on December 31 , 2017 , he will also serve as an advisor and youth coach - in full salary .
as a player he paid Rodri@@ guez long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 for his team ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle marin@@ ers ( from 1994 to 2000 ) , Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 he achieved a number of mil@@ estones .
with the Hall of Fame members H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e M@@ ays , only two other bas@@ eball player in the main statistics show similar values .
but the 41 @-@ year @-@ old wouldn &apos;t be included in the rest of the Hall of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls .
because so successfully Rodri@@ guez - nick@@ name &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; - on the field was so controversi@@ al is its appearance outside the square .
already in 2009 the super@@ star at &quot; ES@@ PN , &quot; was used to have banned ster@@ oids from 2001 to 2003 .
in August 2013 , he was blocked for 211 games in the so @-@ called bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ and@@ al until the end of 2014 .
Rodri@@ guez is considered the major , for many years to have received an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
after a legal dispute the sperm was reduced to 162 encoun@@ ters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the League could even have done for me for the year 2014 , because I played 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ guez then ad@@ dic@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even his f@@ arewell @-@ days are not silent .
while many bas@@ eball bats in their last games still receive the great stage , Rodri@@ guez had to sit on the bank .
&quot; my job contains no f@@ arewell tour . &quot;

Rio de Janeiro - Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Games are over@@ shot by the first official d@@ op@@ ing@@ es .
a medal had won almost a medal .
before the seventh competition , the first official d@@ op@@ ing@@ sis have become the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter @-@ obst@@ acle in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and the Polish ge@@ aring @-@ ber Adrian Ziel@@ inski were successfully tested and excluded - immediately before the beginning of the oh@@ ach@@ able athl@@ ete , this news for the time .
in Ch@@ en , the di@@ ure@@ tics of hydro@@ chlor@@ o@@ thi@@ azi@@ de has been detected last Sunday , which is used as m@@ asked medium for d@@ op@@ ing@@ arm distances .
on Friday afternoon the International Sports Court CA@@ S confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games .
on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old took the fourth place in the final about 100 m Butterfly , only about 0.09 seconds it missed the bronze medal .
on Friday , Ch@@ en would have to take up over 50 m Freestyle .
he has applied the opening of the B @-@ Trial at the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) at the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) .
the national association take the matter &apos; very seriously and requires from Ch@@ en full cooperation with the investigations &quot; cited X@@ in@@ hua and of a Communication : &quot; we will work with the International Sport@@ Court CA@@ S and will accept the judgment . &quot;
for the first time in history , no longer the IOC , but the CA@@ S is responsible for the sanctions of athletes with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio , the news about the positive test at Dan@@ ek@@ ova through , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went to the offensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is an incredible shock &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said on the Bulgarian TV channel B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is not guilty , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only declaration might be food supplements &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explained the Track &amp; Field Athlet@@ ics &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report it is alleged to act with the associated substance of blood d@@ op@@ ing@@ ents EP@@ O .
Dan@@ ek@@ ova has been temporarily suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ Trial also should have a positive result .
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ jko Bor@@ is@@ sow mel@@ an@@ ted with criticism of the athl@@ ete .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why the sports@@ men do not draw the right shots , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are under observation , so many are already excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for instance , all weigh@@ t@@ lif@@ ter from chronic d@@ op@@ ing@@ ed nation can not participate in Rio .
on Friday the event &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was also known , the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was positive on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ rol@@ on .
both contest in@@ gest@@ ion , both are not allowed to start in class up to 94 kg .
prior to the start of athletes , Dan@@ ek@@ ova is another serious blow for the reputation of the entire sport .
the IA@@ AF world association ended the entire Russian team up to an exception of systematic di@@ op@@ ings , also the L@@ äu@@ n@@ ating Kenya has produced numerous poor messages in Rio .
in the swimming sport , the earlier convic@@ tions were also ensured in China for severe disp@@ utes between the athletes .
that is the Fr@@ ench@@ man Camil@@ le Lac@@ our@@ t the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang har@@ sch .
&quot; Sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt l@@ ila &quot; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I see the podium over 200 m Freestyle I will surrender myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun also stood at the heart of a meditation with the Australian M@@ ack H@@ ort@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for d@@ oping prayer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said this . &quot; &quot; &quot;

data cl@@ au : so per@@ fi@@ de er@@ presses h@@ ack@@ ing her rans@@ om
programmer of comp@@ ress@@ ors malware currently use targeted companies - and they are successful .
according to a current survey of the malware infection specialist Mal@@ de@@ eb@@ ytes under 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 per cent of surveyed companies were at least once , partly multiple victims of a attack with Press@@ er software .
in Germany nearly 20 percent of companies were already aiming at a R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware infusion .
40 percent of the victims paid by the perpet@@ rators in order to re@@ use the challenged systems and data .
the perpet@@ rators have specialized their res@@ press@@ ors software according to the observ@@ ations of mal@@ em@@ eb@@ ytes on attacks in corporate networks .
if they succeed there , the potential fra@@ gment money is significantly higher than with private use .
&quot; we currently observe rapid evolution of pollutants , &quot; Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes @-@ chief Mar@@ cin K@@ ep@@ z@@ yn@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; World . &quot;
in 2008 most Mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs have been designed to send advertis@@ ements .
then discovered the perpet@@ rators press software for themselves .
only private use were the goal , but the change to the sk@@ ill@@ ings took place in the past few months .
R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware is working according to a simple pattern : once upon the computer of a sacrifice , it seeks specifically to un@@ successful files such as Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files , as well as to archive of images and videos .
these files encrypted the R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustainable .
subsequently the software presents the demands of the comp@@ ress@@ er .
in order to receive the final turn@@ key code you need to transfer the victims money - usually in the form of Cr@@ yp@@ assing Bit@@ coin .
but where individuals who use personal use of personal photography database on the game , it is about to secure sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production is shut down .
accordingly , the damage is cancelled when a R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware strikes .
22 per cent of the total number of companies affected by R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware , 13 percent had to break the business activities completely , in a case there were people in Fat@@ al .
in Germany , multiple hospitals victims were already threatened by attacks whose patients can be threatened by loss of nurse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say the victims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t pay , you promotes only the problem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains K@@ ep@@ z@@ yn@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but 80 to 90 percent of companies that are paying , will get their data again .
for managers it is difficult , in view of a stand@@ still in operation the demand of perpet@@ rators .
the h@@ acker turn again and try everything to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , the security researchers conducted by F @-@ Secure the user area and the contact with the comp@@ ress@@ ors are examined and come to the result : the perpet@@ rators are actually trying to set up a type of customer service to take more money .
you explain to their victims by chat how to pay via Bit@@ coin , freely accessible support sites , or de@@ cryp@@ t free example files .
and they will redeemed private people with payments of a few hundred euros , companies must pay hard negoti@@ ating and five @-@ digit sum@@ s to get their data un@@ coded .
in view of the potential and relatively ris@@ ky profits from the R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware infusion , the h@@ acker are always professional and share the work , explains security experts of Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from the Internet provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a bi@@ ans@@ om@@ ware around within a week . &quot;
it is more likely that there are three or four people .
the programm@@ ers sell their damage software then in the form of a software building blocks to the actual p@@ press@@ ors .
the existing malware kits produced by malware itself , advice and additional tools bought for one @-@ time , fixed price between 1000 and $ 10,000 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the scope of delivery includes an adaptation tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and bran@@ ding can be changed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the comp@@ ress@@ ors are then looking for more h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the newly purchased software under the victims .
we live in a service sector .
so you log in one of the for@@ ums in the underground , buying the set of a crimin@@ als and commissioned another way to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
payment is made per in@@ fiz@@ ated calcul@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually , the crimin@@ als al@@ lied with dis@@ sem@@ ination , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declares Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the risk of R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware is now widely known for many companies that secure their data .
more than 50 percent of companies processors in the Mal@@ de@@ eb@@ ytes survey will trust that R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware can withstand using file @-@ back @-@ ups and sc@@ ann@@ er@@ software .
the perpet@@ rators already persec@@ ute new strategies .
&quot; if the encryption of data alone does not have sufficient threat for successful recovery , the perpet@@ rators instead of sensitive data such as customer opinions or quot@@ ations , declared Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes @-@ boss Mar@@ cin K@@ ep@@ z@@ yn@@ ski .
this means the damage potential according to the type of data even by a multiple higher than before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perpet@@ rators could now take completely new goals on the Internet of Things &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the Hack@@ ney Conference Def@@ con demonstrated safety researchers , as they could get connected with the internet @-@ connected thermo@@ stat under their control .
in the middle of the winter , the un@@ folding of a der@@ art block could definitely be worth a rans@@ om .
if the perpet@@ rators then block a whole production road in the future instead of the heating in the future , R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware could also become a theme in Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday applications
in the small HR @-@ V Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little cou@@ pe , and also the versat@@ ility of a mini@@ v@@ ans .
sounds quite reas@@ onably priced , but the HR V , which was built on the same new platform as the new jazz , has actually proved to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers have a lot of space both in the first row and there is a lot of space in the rear .
the materials of the interior space are well finished and work comfortable , only the cockpit surface falls off there .
the HR @-@ V is much more versatile than comparable vehicles .
it is not only a boot space of 453 l at high and 10@@ 26 l when folded back lock is available , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot;
this is less mag@@ ically , than it sounds : the seat surface of the back bench can be seen like Kin@@ os@@ essel and offer it storage space that is height up to ceilings 1,@@ 24 m high .
the boot space is well @-@ loaded , but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR @-@ V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed range .
but he is likely to do some qui@@ eter work .
the everyday consumption of 4,7 l / 100 km is gr@@ ati@@ fying .
there is another motor car : a 1.5 liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
a four @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the handling is balanced , a good compromise between dynamic and comfort .
but the steering system is likely to be direct .
the equipment can be opened in the tested top variant &quot; Executive &quot; no wishes .
the security systems is one of the City emergency assistance systems ( working with temp@@ o . 32 ) , the coll@@ isions system and trace assistant .
sometimes , the coll@@ isions prov@@ oked me , because he has been rated as &quot; her@@ ann@@ ah@@ ing Ob@@ jects &quot; at the rank@@ ings .
very reliable works the remote control assistant .
and intelligent speed regulator re@@ acts to the traffic sign detection and thr@@ ott@@ le when needed .
the full connectivity is available only for the top features : 7 @-@ inch touch screen , Nav@@ i , App Integration and More .
two USB@@ - and a HDMI jack are under the arm@@ rest and are therefore a bit aw@@ k@@ ward .
the approximately 29@@ 000 Euro for the well @-@ equipped top @-@ diesel are fine .
who doesn &apos;t want to invest so much , will receive the gasoline engine from 20,000 euros , diesel starting from 23@@ 000 Euro .
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard .
with the HR @-@ V Honda offers lots of versatile and everyday use .
Airline is not liable : fall on passenger jet@@ ty
the airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger jet@@ ty .
the Higher Regional Court of Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) is a liability for adh@@ esion , which is typical of the air traffic .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had broken up a kne@@ e bin in the fall .
however , the accident could have ever happen everywhere - it is a common risk of life , so the dish .
the airline had to pay damage compensation .
disease case : when paid by the organizers
ill tourists get money back after their journey only money back when the cause of the disease is und@@ ou@@ bt@@ edly found in the hotel .
but this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests reported the same symptoms .
in the case of the case , a family was heavily consuming and vom@@ iting on the second day of its tur@@ qu@@ oise on the second day .
she spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
their condition led the vac@@ ation@@ ists back to a def@@ ective plot that supp@@ os@@ edly poll@@ uted sal@@ tw@@ ater .
the family was the view that would have been a lack of peace - and def@@ endant against the organis@@ er .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs had no success before the Court .
indeed , the se@@ wage situation was def@@ ective .
but the organis@@ er knew only shortly before departure of the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs .
he had to go out till then the sea@@ water was fine .
so he did not viol@@ ate its information , so the verdict .
especially in the samples of water no contamination were found .
the disease of several hotel guests - bl@@ ur@@ ably , due to infection among themselves - are one of the common risk of life .
there were only 38 people from 6@@ 91 guests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the refugees forced violence in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach had many people wor@@ ried about other attacks in July . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the state must change and react to the terror@@ ists at the same time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; safe is : our country will not answer the violence of the perpet@@ rators &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will not assume this triumph as terror@@ ists .
when criminal off@@ ences have to leave the country , however , the safety and strength is also the approval of the population for refugee policy .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère aims to achieve a implementation of the proposals by the Bundestag election in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced a further management rein@@ forcement of security forces , namely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over several years &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sympath@@ y for terrorism has to come under penalty .
video surveillance is supposed to improve the ce@@ ase@@ correctly so much that the purchase of weapons in the Internet is expected .
the last much @-@ discussed silence for doctors shall be avoided by de Mai@@ zi@@ ères words .
however , in dialogue with the medical case , he wants to search for solutions such as the haz@@ ards of the citizen could be reduced , he said with views of mental ab@@ normal@@ ities .
in order to prevent a radic@@ alization of refugees , the Minister holds a better social care for assistance .
teachers need to be better prepared for dealing with trau@@ mat@@ ised people .
for the persecution of crimin@@ als in the special areas of the Internet ( Dar@@ k@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning to use investig@@ ator investigations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD Chef Gabriel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is important that the Minister of the Interior clearly stated against shareholder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a witness for the Hin@@ ge @-@ makers in the CDU / CS@@ U &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Gabriel told the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke media group ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had re@@ rejected Ru@@ ves from the Union to a Bur@@ ka ban and the abol@@ ition of the double nationality .
he also hold a general prohibition of complet@@ eness for constitutional difficulties .
you can &apos;t offer everything you re@@ jects , and I rest the wearing of the bur@@ ka .
one could talk about rules about road traffic or for witnesses in court .
green @-@ boss in Simone Peter designed the minister , he would like to simul@@ ate with always new anti @-@ terror attacks and action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ parties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fle@@ et and a deep@@ ening of the right of stay in this country do not bring more safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better traffic flow on the highway
it st@@ alls regular on the b@@ ypass road - here a picture of November .
but this is supposed to change : the legal limit is to be extended .
this is a good news for all the motor@@ cyclists who stand in the professional traffic on the ambient road every evening in the St@@ au when they drive over the highway of Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
the country road road construction extended on Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between Hammer Street and the exit Wes@@ eler road track the legal track lane by 700 meters .
drive then directly from the Hammer street to the right .
the great advantage : the traffic divi@@ des an early stage , which means that the overall production process will be improved on the multiple part of the Bundes@@ strasse 51 .
the idea with the extended exit of the CDU faction in the District Münster @-@ West .
the driving force on the side@@ br@@ inger nerv@@ t is mostly between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
on week@@ days , the return @-@ st@@ au goes up to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ g road and sometimes also beyond that .
the reason is the needle &apos;s eye on the B 51 shortly before the exit Wes@@ eler .
from here , traffic will only be guided through the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be built about three @-@ four@@ ths years ago .
the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the required load capacity in order to absorb the heavy duty traffic bil@@ is@@ pur@@ ig .
as long as this bott@@ len@@ eck and the associated advertising St@@ au will not say , the competent state can not say .
however , with years to expect : for the bridge has an official start @-@ up time by 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the legal rule over the country , the user has sought the medi@@ ating time in the school holidays , because with disabilities .
the traffic will be passed on Tuesday and Wednesday and passed on the site .
intercultural travel : cultural offers for schools

rain instead of star@@ vation : hope on weather recovery
the weather was made in the south @-@ west of Germany in the south@@ western part of Germany &apos;s night to Friday through the bill , but there are still hope .
the night was especially suitable for clouds and rain in the sky to observe the sky spect@@ acle , said the chairman of the ob@@ servatory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we see a lot of th@@ ri@@ ots in the sky .
the star@@ ves are about Pers@@ ei@@ den , which belong to the fastest shooting with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour .
they have their names , because they come from the constellation Per@@ se@@ us that goes in the northeast .
relaxing Night : tips On Sle@@ ep
in the evening you can stay for hours , at night there is hours for hours , in the morning far from the wake of the wake @-@ up of sleep .
that is everything else than relaxing .
after all , one of these problems are in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about one quarter of adult sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces and more than ten percent will feel free , or permanently as non @-@ relaxing .
how do sleeping problems or sleep disorders ?
there are several forms of sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces , and it can end@@ ure them diverse causes , emphas@@ ises Hans @-@ Günter We@@ e@@ ß , member of the German Society for Sle@@ ep and Sle@@ ep Medicine .
whatever you under@@ stands , but is the in@@ som@@ nie , thus an in@@ power and a sleeping anno@@ ying .
just the sleep sleep , many people find as harm@@ less or in@@ adequate , says Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , member of the German house medical association with practice in the Lower Saxony Var@@ el .
what &apos;s behind sleeping disorders ?
the causes of sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces are complex .
behind it , organic , psych@@ ic or behaviour @-@ related factors , but also pres@@ cription drugs .
not rare , the sleeping expression of another disease is not rare .
&quot; very early spring is especially common with depression , &quot; says We@@ e@@ ß .
and it can be that different factors need one another .
those who have a her@@ ni@@ ated disc may be po@@ or@@ ly lie , w@@ akes every two to three hours , and begins to gre@@ et over all day problems and care about everyday problems , We@@ e@@ ß is an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
from when should one eat with sleep disorders ?
if you should not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week , should not be imp@@ acted on the day should leave the doctor .
the impair@@ ment can look completely different : one is beaten , tired , tired , sleep@@ y , has trouble with the attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical symptoms such as stomach or head@@ ache .
in order to lin@@ king sleeping , it is important to find out their causes .
as treatment options include behavi@@ oral changes , a cogn@@ itive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or also medic@@ ations - classic sleep tablets only in exceptional case and for a maximum of two weeks - in@@ quire .
the dormitories are hardly in Germany , emphas@@ izes Prof. Ingo Fi@@ etze , head of the inter@@ disciplinary or medical centre of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin .
that is why it should be used at bed@@ time in sleep problems , av@@ enge We@@ e@@ ß .
the problem can clari@@ fy if the problems have a physical cause .
who should sleep in sleep , and what happens ?
for exam@@ ining in sleep laboratory rates medical advice , for example , with breathing difficulties , if necessary , if necessary , if sleeping in sleep or if you don &apos;t find the cause of a sleeping disorder , Fi@@ xe explains .
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the study .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; only don &apos;t make a lun@@ ch@@ ap , &quot; says Fi@@ etze .
after shut@@ down , you go to the bed at its normal time .
in addition to the electrodes at the body you carry a nose g@@ og@@ gles , a chest strap and a anten@@ n@@ ler on the fingers .
in addition , a camera also features the sleeping ceiling .
how can I get the problems in the handle ?
there are quite a lot of positions to which you can put for a better sleep .
We@@ e@@ ß counts on : regular sleeping and rising times , not to sleep long in bed , not to sleep in the bed , don &apos;t have to sleep on the clock , don &apos;t start to calculate , and that &apos;s all and not to be eligible .
what the jung@@ le Camp with missing medals in the swimming pool
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has sold a dis@@ ap@@ pointing cutting of the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 he took gold at the world &apos;s short @-@ country nationals for the first time , and set his first world record at the same time .
now , the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ let Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has been protected against his presence in the cr@@ iti@@ que team @-@ mates from Facebook .
&quot; in a country where an Olympic champion receives 20,000 € Premium , and a jung@@ le ch@@ efs you should tell no one of missing medals , &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote in the night to Friday on his Facebook page .
the conveying system in the swimming pool is poor , the D@@ op@@ ing@@ controlled by contrast is very good .
with this we can &apos;t compete with countries that promote very much and even operate on d@@ oping the topic d@@ oping down or even operate it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls should be stopped here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to launch a com@@ eback , it would have to report nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( NA@@ DA ) .
just so you should keep it with countries .
&quot; who can not take a certain time before the WM / OS of independent controllers , the WA@@ DA / F@@ INA may not participate , &quot; requires the Hamburger Choice Hamburg , who now runs an ice@@ berg .
airport : Ban@@ de of Bag@@ gage arrested
professional Thi@@ eves at the Düsseldorf Airport
civil servants of the Düssel@@ dor@@ fer Police managed the arrest of two women and two men aged between 50 and 61 years .
the facts had already committed as a ban@@ de several pocket @-@ bags and luggage ste@@ els .
at 21.@@ 30 a.m. civil servants in the area of the airport Düsseldorf had a ban@@ de that was known to the polic@@ emen from the past theft of theft .
the two women and two men had committed a number of delay since the middle of July in the middle of July .
the specialists in the Criminal Court 34 can re@@ prove the im@@ presses of criminal off@@ ences in Germany , four acts .
in total , they caught a total of more than 15.000 Euro .
altars , a few lin@@ king trees , in between the rest of a head@@ stone pav@@ ement : the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain does not work on the first sight , but the police counts it to the &quot; dangerous locations &quot; of the city .
if you come along the east to the west , one gets on playing places , a refresh@@ ing kinder@@ garten and a Bi@@ ol@@ ades .
on the façade of a grey house someone has &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; spra@@ yed . &quot;
opposite a Li@@ dl , which is also to be demolished soon , it is already built : by 2017 a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be created .
articles about this &quot; trendy district , &quot; how the competent real estate company Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain are described in the last weeks using burning cars .
reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents are occupied , but in the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , the Inn@@ ens@@ en@@ ator &apos;s handle had multiple awards for a tough race against the project , the area known as &quot; no @-@ Go @-@ Zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 known as the starting point of autonomous violence .
after 22 June the rooms were vac@@ ated on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schm@@ ie@@ de , with 300 officers , according to the official statements , according to 30 to 40 civil servants and three fre@@ igh@@ th cars , closed parts of the street and held a visitor to access the house with number 94 .
meanwhile in its renovated building workers in the order of the unknown house owners the rooms .
on 13 July , a Berlin administrative court decided that the clearance had been illeg@@ ally illeg@@ ally , and a day later , police and builders filed under the Ju@@ bel of sympath@@ izers and residents .
in this summer afternoon the street seems peace@@ fully : parents are walking with children , people sitting on the brush in front of the houses in the sun , others enter@@ tain@@ ed in late Sp@@ ät@@ i .
in the immediate vicinity of the skin projects there are primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens .
left violence is not the main purpose of many residents : K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in the &quot; Kie@@ z &quot; since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , which attrac@@ ts three children here , especially from the police presence .
with the residents of the skin projects they share the concern before rising and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
it sounds not just after a p@@ inch , who wish for majority of pol@@ ishing Poli@@ cies in front of the left side .
the tr@@ ench , which of the Berlin inner en@@ ator and the police are inv@@ aded and their neighbours therefore does not exist .
Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain in the East of Berlin actually was a traditional working district , which even today has a lower average population in comparison to the rest of the city .
also in fact , in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including almost the entire ma@@ z@@ zer street , close to the Riga .
while the Mainz was cleared under great police , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Riga , and are still inhabited by people who had occupied them 26 years ago .
at the same time , the neighborhood has become increasingly part of the mag@@ nets for tourists and election liner from all over the world : with them now share living from the GDR @-@ time and former house occupied their p@@ ups .
this is also noticeable during the rent which has risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings in the Rig@@ s are attacked as symbols for this development : one will recognize them out of the disc or fresh@@ ly coated fac@@ ades , which were rejected with shades .
no other street was mentioned so often along with the words &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence . &quot;
a reason why not all neigh@@ bors who have seen as a problem , could not necessarily be affected by the crimin@@ ality : criminal off@@ ences such as human injuries , according to statistics , nearly exclusively against polic@@ emen .
most of the offen@@ ders make damages of non@@ damage , the ten@@ ds to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses .
for K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a rental building for 17 years in a rental next to the controversi@@ al 94 , un@@ certainty cannot be given .
the men of violence is crucial : the people in the 94 are their neighbours therefore that have not been dest@@ ined .
also the famous spar@@ ked cars give it directly in the Rig@@ s no longer anymore .
for who studied Archit@@ ect@@ in , her road no criminal point , on the contrary : &quot; here is one another , lives together on the street and gets more of each other than what else . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is deliber@@ ately moved to the Riga Road - and remained .
in this reason , it was so important that the residents of the people returned to its road : from the police , politics and the media , who in July all the de@@ vis@@ itation of the city suddenly demands .
but in the eyes of residents such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer will continue to be taken away : due to recent re@@ constructions in former building g@@ aps , which penet@@ rate the old residents .
&quot; these are ultimately the con@@ domin@@ iums that are not interesting for many here - there are more people who are not so good , &quot; says it .
&quot; violence and destruction can I not be highly gu@@ ish . &quot;
but what can we do if any one never stops ?
there will be fru@@ stration in all sides , even with the police and the inhabitants .
for tra@@ cked , which cont@@ ested over color @-@ bombs , K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the p@@ inch .
who attrac@@ ts himself , should be aware of this - just like someone who is in a k@@ p@@ addle quarter , there can be po@@ or@@ ly compl@@ ain about noise .
all only asked with pre @-@ names were asked , not to be named with their correct name
Ur@@ bach : An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is a refugee student
An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the responsi@@ bly in terms of integration and organis@@ ers .
in addition , she is a social worker .
since July An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee status for Ur@@ bach .
social ped@@ agog@@ ue supports the team of administration to Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees himself as a contact partner for all actors : refugees , working for refugees , administration , authorities and those who are still mixed .
RE@@ G@@ INE customer of the working group indicates that hon@@ ors are more than than@@ k@@ ful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the purpose of pleas@@ ures wo@@ k , which has especially a problem .
so , some - less sp@@ aw@@ ful than rather than much on the ple@@ dge @-@ reaching reserves - meant that the administration wanted to write the place .
looking for an administration force with a talent for languages and people , associated with a long @-@ term experience in the field of social work , just a ei@@ ving Woll@@ st@@ au .
but administration work is not its central area , calls An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
above all , it is to organization , work with the people on site and also behind the scenes and network activity .
the 31 year old has been there for around six weeks .
it is limited to a 50 @-@ percent spot on three years .
&quot; it was highest time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer that An@@ ni@@ ka Engl@@ ish@@ man hon@@ ors and super@@ official actors supported .
there are large and small issues , organiz@@ ational , human and understanding problems .
soon we are new containers in the Was@@ enstraße
a serious problem has been recognized for some time to find apartments for the inter@@ fer@@ ries which have been recognized .
the municipalities are responsible for the connection washers .
you need to place the refugees in their own or rented rooms .
the costs for the construction , rent or renovation of these accommodation must be borne by the community .
the responsibility is changed from the country estate with community and job center .
problem : there are free objects , but not each land@@ lord wants to offer its apartment .
the search have been designed for some time than very difficult .
de fac@@ to finds no private apartments .
so far it did not work so far , one would be referred to private apartments so Deu@@ ver@@ le .
hence , communities must be re@@ done , as it is so beautiful .
so a new container will soon be placed in the washing machine .
but only with apartments is not done .
perspective is the key@@ word , are Reg@@ ine customer and An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
in addition to a fixed lead , there are intern@@ ships , training places , training places , one @-@ euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants which have to be established or established .
&quot; more places were well &quot; reported Reg@@ ine customer .
many work in the building yard or help house@@ masters , do @-@ profit work - and motiv@@ ates and very ti@@ dy , as An@@ ni@@ ka Engl@@ ish@@ le reports .
it hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive outer effect .
this is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
but activity does not work yet .
the day requires a fixed structure , say Deu@@ ver@@ le and customer .
people ought to develop an om@@ i@@ veness feeling .
so it offers offers such as sports , contacts with loc@@ als and especially language courses .
professional courses are ra@@ r .
so you can jump in administration and honorary funds .
it is central that the refugees get the feeling they are in Germany and welcome them .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
you must explain the refugees that it takes time and take a sense of sense , for example with language courses .
who sometimes know the feeling that he could not work in Ur@@ bach , they do not work and be un@@ profitable , he will never integrate .
the distinct majority is motiv@@ ated .
problem cases , however , says customer hon@@ est , &quot; People , where nothing goes nothing . &quot; the work of Deu@@ ver@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others .
all this is a &quot; Mamm@@ ut@@ task . &quot;
a difficult question : did the two inci@@ dents respond to radic@@ alization , also in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ine customer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what man@@ cher can call you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a rem@@ nant could &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could not close them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
lowering the must@@ ard the hel@@ pers are already .
these inci@@ dents have also been subject to refugees .
they had the fear that the attack they complete them completely .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer .
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so you need to spend main and honorary volunteers on site and in the region after activities .
in the background they always have in the background that soon a new school of refugees and migrants to Ur@@ bach could come .
does Germany need an upper limit ?
the question is clear to answer this question .
actually it is un@@ fair to set them hel@@ pers on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ur@@ bach we have not arrived here where we want to go , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no new refugees , that would relax .
RE@@ G@@ INE customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ b@@ acher was already util@@ ized to integrate the previous people in rati@@ onal .
there are currently around 100 people , the majority of young men .
but if people are in need to help them , both women are united .
the political world situation is so complicated , there is no simple answers .
