<seg id="1">Clinics and Trumps Economic Policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">In infrastructure and prevent the TTP trade agreement - we want both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two U.S. presidential competitives are one of the tax and energy policies as well as in a basic question.</seg>
<seg id="4">Differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamental, more philosophical distinction.</seg>
<seg id="5">The role of the role of the State.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep in doubt rather small and warns before, as the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulators.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wanted to control the economy to death and regulate death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">It himself would be different, claimed Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">He will drive bulators massively, and he makes himself strong tax reform with lower tax rates strongly - for individuals and businesses.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton opposed it: the state has appointed certain tasks, he has disadvantageous chances to open and needs money.</seg>
<seg id="11">Therefore the tax for the wealrich would increase, says it.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the topic infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">To be invested in the need to say Trump and Clinton almost immediately.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic Candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in the infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are rejected by the state-critical Tex-wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">Thus, at Trump, we could get internal discussions.</seg>
<seg id="17">More significant are the differences in energy and climate policies.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal plants and drive coal plants in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil support is also possible to terminate in the Paris climate agreement as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="20">In contrast to its investment program, Clinton aims to strengthen and demands Renewable Energies: "a country will make the superpower of a clean energies and create millions jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "it will be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in the infrastructure - even with international trade agreement, both competitors are not far from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the acia-fish trading agreement, do not want to sign both.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, both parties don't want to isolate the USA from international trade, but just better protect American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">They are then to be paid better, calls for Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The present minimum wage of 7,25 US dollars is a hunger strike.</seg>
<seg id="27">He wants to raise it up to $15 per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">As if Trump wants to do this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must be rushing, then he says he must not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">However, the big discussion of the coming months should probably develop rather to develop the control policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the one hand stands Trump, who wants to load the economy and the citizens to spur growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics kept him before, that the budgetary deficit would only be bigger.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand Clinton, who want to ask at least from the wealom, wants to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not even the solution.</seg>

<seg id="2">Sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone, almost as to everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="3">If they come in Germany, they often are sad.</seg>
<seg id="4">A house provides refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a large kitchen there are four females.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each has a baby, which is not a year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One has put her little son into his arm.</seg>

<seg id="12">The scene works normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until one speaks with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is part of the Managing Director of Condrobs, a sponsor for Social Benefit offers in Bavaria, and deals with the topic of women on the run.</seg>
<seg id="15">Four women in the kitchen are poultry.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralised accommodations for allround women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January Condrobs made up the establishment together with Pro Familia and the Munich Frauenhilfe.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was officially opened officially.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>

<seg id="24">Among women, other reasons for escape: "many steal away secretly, because they don't see any other way."</seg>
<seg id="25">In their home they have experience with sexual violence, compulsion, Honor, slavery or forced prostitution.</seg>
<seg id="26">That drives them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the run goes on.</seg>
<seg id="28">"tug for instance, for example a bottle of water require a sexual action, is no rarity," says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="29">And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">Who believe that the end, as soon as they are in Germany, irre, says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="31">Also here, all women in refugee groups would often be considered as minating and awful if mischief.</seg>
<seg id="32">This leads to the fact that approximately 90 percent of women who live in the north of Munich will be traumatised.</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children are not voluntary in favour."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are so usual that they say nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "or they did not trust to speak openly about the awakening, because the shame is too great." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">Since they often have no help to help you need more accommodation only for them, requires Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="37">The seven District authorities are responsible for the placing of refugees in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="38">On the question whether they wasted from a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction area, answer some with no.</seg>
<seg id="39">In the Oberpfalz region and Oberfranken, there will be something that is not in substitution for governments.</seg>
<seg id="40">Even in Schwaben alone, women fled not separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, press briecher of the government.</seg>
<seg id="41">In Upper Bavaria, Lower and Central franken is available in some community floors or own houses only for single-standing women and their children.</seg>
<seg id="42">The exception is Lower Bavaria, there are two central accommodations only for women.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "also the" "" "rights of Women and Gender Equality" "" "" "" "in the European Parliament calls for women to be separated from men." ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: a "alliance of Foreign Affairs"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce their hands and to the official end of the eight months of continuous war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin grants his Turkish counterpart in the gilded conference of St. Petersburg Palastes in the reception, I can not forbid that Ankara wants to make them most reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the hand, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putto the smile, narlipple and he radiate barely warmth, even for its past conditions.</seg>
<seg id="7">In contrast, Recep Tayyip Erdogan said to his "dear friend" Putin - according to a report of five times.</seg>
<seg id="8">I could not count it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia could not only return to their old level before the crisis, but even better.</seg>
<seg id="10">On the next day a newspaper described that Erdogan would have thought so much worse than ever happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">My enthusiasm appeared to me rather the contrary.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's radiant, sustainable cooling showed that the Russian president of Russia had nothing forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of crisis was the first to mention in his actions: the shooting of a Russian fighter aircraft from the Syrian border crossing Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow out of reaction at the time was wake-fire.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin shared from and accused Ankara, to be in the back.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was even bigger, since it was committed by a veritable friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Vetropes will be rebuild again, if not impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">The public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the state controlled media led a strong, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At one time, when the Turks would bear the iniquity of everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">The serious accusation of senior officials were that Erdogan's own family had benefited from illegal oil trade in the areas of Syria, which was controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He has fought this vehement.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look at the front.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse of the President Erdogan who wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia was able to book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the benefits of an armistice is clear at hand.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan needs primarily with all friends who can get, after he has been disclosed the last month with a failed coup d "état of almost his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="28">Again, terror attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economical designs.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions enormously hit Turkey - in particular the ban of charist who usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number of shares declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, the tour operators and charter companies will be facilitated if the flights will be resumed again.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count towards a late aisonal sign in the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the state television set up fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are imported again.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in Vedemosti formulated it in the following way:" "" "tourists long, tomatoes live here." ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is mad on the West, since it's reaction to the attempted power of power as a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">To do this, the continued groove of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the piping on it is to withdraw from cool mood and reduce the relationship between Turkey and the West.</seg>
<seg id="39">In Ankara won a bonus for Ankara with security, that he asked for the attempted coup 'support for the selected state organs.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is true for Moscow, a self-understanding which itself has a profound fear of rain.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this glittering palace in the sea made it possible Russia and Turkey, one, as it had described me a analyst, "Alliance of external sides": two countries which are cast away from the west and poorly treated and feeling allied with.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nonetheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow had recently delivered the role as a peace camp, but Russia and Turkey support other matters.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be noted that after almost three hours they sang both President on the press conference that they would not have stopped the topic once again.</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey vered it to answer a question about its differences, while Putin decided to emphasise this.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster, the NATO member Turkey sent the Russian martial jet, it certainly is better that the two heads of heads are at least once again.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to the Bank's board, the RBS brand should only be reduced to a backoffice role according to the Bank's Management Board.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Royal Bank of Scotland is no longer available for customers outside of Scotland.</seg>
<seg id="4">Ross McEwan shared the BBC Scotland that the RBS brand associated with the global Ambitions of the Bank.</seg>
<seg id="5">Since then the Bank has since distanced since eight years ago and had to be saved.</seg>
<seg id="6">In this period, "RBS" has been used to protect other end consumer brands.</seg>
<seg id="7">They supported the international sport with millions of pounds in Sponsoring, from the Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.</seg>
<seg id="8">But now it has decided to go to the more national stamps in the focus.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland, but will not be initialized.</seg>
<seg id="10">In England and Wales all RSB references become references, the decentralised headquarters and stock exchange to NatWest.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ulster Bank brand is already used to customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are other things that are smaller brands for private clients who will receive more importance - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.</seg>
<seg id="13">McEWAN has been interviewed during a guided tour of customers and employees in Inverness-Shire.</seg>
<seg id="14">He shared the BBC Scotland with: "the brand RSB is coming to our investment brand as well as to the brand, among which our employees will be employed, since we now become more to a bank of brands."</seg>
<seg id="15">When the Bank has become a global brand, RBS became a global mark.</seg>
<seg id="16">I say now that we do not track global targets but local goals.</seg>
<seg id="17">Each of these stamps will be entirely different in their own communes for something completely different and our employees will work with the customer under these stamps.</seg>
<seg id="18">RBS already told that it will not continue to continue its Six Nations Sponsoring and that it will increase the importance of different brands in its Sport-Sponsoring.</seg>
<seg id="19">"it's time for us to develop the marks of the brand, as we focus on inside (we asked) to make this a better bank for customers?" said the CEO.</seg>
<seg id="20">It would have been very zynical before three years ago, if we had said that we will be a great bank for our customers and launched this brand.</seg>
<seg id="21">But with our work, the focus on customer needs, and not our own, I think we will see many changes.</seg>
<seg id="22">We can again leave this brand again, therefore I think that time has come.</seg>

<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who has been a deputy chairman since 2012, was appointed his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital of Tallinn, he graduated from the renowned National Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the embassy in Tokyo.</seg>

<seg id="13">Convince the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergey Ivanov was a long time one of the closest confidentiality Vladimir Putin and works as he is for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men of the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">During a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcasted in television, both men claimed that Chief of Staff will return on his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smile for the cameras, only few are convinced - especially in front of the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So, is the consequence of a kind of power?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody presently knows that.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official claim - that a man who once was elected as a potential president, would like to lead to the Russian environmental policy - fell to big skepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his comments on Putin, who are cited on the site of the Kreml., Ivanov said, "it is true that I have asked for a discussion in early 2012, to me this very complicated position - you could almost say - to be able to trust four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov assumed the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin former Member of the State Security Service KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), he was appointed KGB in his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">As Putin he came to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people who trusted in most.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once that Ivanov was supposed to turn the second term of President of Russia in the second term of office, as a third term of Putting to the Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post has been taken by a further, close-end allies, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>

<seg id="2">The SPD and Grüne mean: investors have to be much stronger than the duty in the future.</seg>

<seg id="4">The SPD proposes a "hand conversion concept" to the next general meeting.</seg>

<seg id="6">First line it is about the question: who should actually build the affordable apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">One regulation is missing.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "SPD Group president Christoph Bratmann:" "" "we are speaking with the greenery: whoever wants to build on urban areas must show 20 percent of all apartments as social-apartments." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">The favourable apartments can also be established in the holdings.</seg>

<seg id="11">"" "" "" "we want to build investors at least 10 percent, but as possible as 20 percent of the apartments as social-apartments." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">A new municipal housing program that will cost millions and will be financed for incentives.</seg>
<seg id="13">The problem, so Frmann: "there is currently no agreement between the fractions."</seg>

<seg id="15">The linke intends to have hardness levels for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Unskilled, the frying resides itself a disappearance of the situation on the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the concept is implemented, it will ensure additional tasks in the building management.</seg>

<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">However, the program is not completely overhaul: because the approximately 1260 new apartments that should be built-in.</seg>
<seg id="21">How is it equal to the loss of another 1300 favorable apartments, whose funding is going to run in the next few years?</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunting after health and happiness that pays off</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating, as the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teens and child for playing no longer go outside, but rather preferable to spend their leisure time to spend their leisure time, on screens in the last decade of many beats.</seg>
<seg id="4">At Pokemon Go, people go to pick up and active people from the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then video games and most recently limited to smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Therefore it's great to see that technology and activities do not exclude in the open.</seg>
<seg id="7">I interconnect to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that were created on the characters, initially created for video games in the 1990s (later on it created a animation series, playing cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">How many phenomena of pop culture decreased the interest in front of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was postponed by massive demand that overburdened the server.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within few days, Pokémon Go has more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, the players go to their Smartphones without and looking for Pokémons that were followed by a GPS after they were once found, "photo" (about a screenshot on the phone) or "being taken."</seg>
<seg id="13">One generation that played the game when she was younger, joined Wahn and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the USA, the game led to a considerable increase in steps which covers the "average" person every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardio, an app for Apple Watch, which followed by the Washington Post recently, announced that within two days after the introduction of the game, the number of people followed, each day 30 minutes, from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company doesn't know what Pokémon Go plays - it only looks for performance improvement.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public reconnaissance campaigns to take care of "30 minutes" to take away "from the sofa," to be active every day, because many public messages are boring to health boring and come out of people who look like.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless the importance of sport cannot be assessed.</seg>
<seg id="19">Who regularly drives sports, reduces his opportunities to prevent cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of advantages that is too long to perform them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful on Pokémon Go is that it takes the people to do something in the open, making it a lot of fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus three pillars of health are covered, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people close the hunt even new friends.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always there are mürrical game destroys, which must always complain about anything.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone might walk against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What should it be?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps had already been able to track our activity as Fitbit, they gave us no reason to play Sport as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its friction and the use will be reproduced with the time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, due to the poker success, there will be more games that can join the Apps and virtual reality with the activity in the real world to help many people on the hunt, active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I preceded by me under the Women's Chess Olympiity and that consisted of more than a reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First, I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US had never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And second: this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, which inspiring many young girls of other skin colour.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jew ist and Madison Kocian, who is catholic, complete, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team is finally reflected the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has made the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport art.</seg>
<seg id="8">Over the last four years, the number one was one Afro-American female.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">That shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic sport in the Americas.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they were unexpected, but most experienced Gymasticroutines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American, who won gold at an individual combined event for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won Silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the tip of this sports type, but so you can't see gym in the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie beat all the same way as Aly and Madison, to make it to the olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the "Last Five," because the next Olympians have only four Tourists in the team. furthermore, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as trainee.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality looks like that Turns is a more expensive sport and Turner first come into private cars, who are holding their parents, competition, travel, travel and hotel costs (for the trainer and their Turner and families). the list may continue to continue any limitations.</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these turnaround are in wealthy suburbs which support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs, Turner get their entire training, and that's for the families a very expensive and long-term commitment.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, both have trained their athletes since they started with the Turns.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to be inspired by the communities of Aun countless, young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, a safe and easy-to-reach turnkey.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gymnastics of 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="24">In my events we have offered free and affordable turnen in Harlem for over 15.000 urban youths (mostly black and hispanic) and national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my home town) to offer high quality-quality wines that make the opportunity to learn from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Turns develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body and hard work, discipline and determinants for the spirit.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life-long advantages for health and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team, which bring thousands of young girls to care for the turkeys and that is great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It's so important to participate in the sport, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">It is so exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this genuine explanation of "Girl Power" by the Holes of the Olympic World Congolds and thank you who motivate so many young girls with a wide background to start their way, healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="4">Regardless of whether you're closer to you from the front or behind, this video will show you how to rotate your thieves.</seg>
<seg id="5">If you get behind it from behind, then you should be turning as the first, so that you can see your attackers and enter "from the Line" says Mizrachi.</seg>
<seg id="6">Take the weapon between your forearm and your shoulder before you beat him with your free Ellbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">Strike him then with the knees to the lath and turn off, while the attacker is crushed out of pain, the weapon from his hands. beat him with the race and move on backward, while they set the weapon on him.</seg>
<seg id="8">When attackers approach themselves from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the line, take the weapon and turn them, so that the attackers cannot shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the same time, reinforcing the weight on the weapon and beat the attackers on the chest, then turn off the weapon from its grip before moving down and place the weapon on him.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveler underdrew his immune system and Congereflex of a serious test - surrounded by some of the most dirty and cold places of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, out of Suffolk will lead his course on a Euro Schein, a railing on Piccadilly Circus, a rinsing pot of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance of its immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">In front of the socks of any object, he used an Luminometer to move and to show us what he is left.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results in daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought that has been used to refuse a tensile strength of a train toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be completely showering, but actually you are in a kitchen dispensing more bad bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals across the foals of gut bacteria and his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Luckily, nothing left what he ableaked, more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright has been known to test the resistance of his gut by going through the world and ate amazing things as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public funds to train stations until go to jetting of toilets, the task introduced his immune system definitely under a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film he told: "already as a child, I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all the possible things in my mouth, Earth, worms, and mud water."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he was definitely justified.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he turned off, was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His trial file showed a luminance of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">In comparison, the Luminometric number is freshly washed hands than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet that refused to refresh after their luminance count over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have a capacity of less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products validation produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the number of bacteria at different places like the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film he says:" "" "this is the worst thing I smoked in a toilet, close" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There are nothing dirty than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will not snails here because it is inscribed here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturers of dairy products valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company pays Mr. Wright with Valio encoder, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the support of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">Validation Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "we wanted to make a really something new.</seg>
<seg id="24">A bit that is fascinating and the benefits of probiotics is explained at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="25">We were crazy brainstormings, which caused that we said, "Let us call us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in the intestinal health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of just about the products, we wanted to put them in a greater context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of the intestinal health and the immune system is linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">Growing interest in the intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide more information on an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who led the directing of the film, added: "let me tell me - I would have tasted my respect for Ian, if he had been sent to him some of the things that I instructed him to live in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to bring them, and others in which this was pretty difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "I'm glad that we have recorded some of these dirty work." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by 2015, 84 percent of all respondents lactic acid bacteria, particularly with the wellness of stomach and intestines and 58 per cent said that they contain at least occasionally products that contain lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">Seltsames Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the natives get nothing of the summer campaign with - and the holidays from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Parliament election will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays, the sword will already decided at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">For that time it is not so far: summer holidays, heat and farming contention.</seg>
<seg id="6">The natives that are convinced by the candidates are on vacation.</seg>
<seg id="7">The very most holidays that are on the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not native to choose from the country.</seg>
<seg id="8">These are practical problems: in the holidays are helpers who are puffed up the posters, split air balloons, flyers, and count towards the end of the vote.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until 4 September 2016, the election and final day of all day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to pass a campaign against itself again by the people of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase when you can say it has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD / CDU coalition, must be on the position of his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, since 1998 the strongest party, is now in polls behind the CDU.</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting how strongly Neuling AfD cuts and remains at the end of the ambitious wallow.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old, and since 2008 Head of government, makes an almost inconspicuous election campaign, one sees his big platen.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels across the land, distributed Rosen and plausts a little with the people, as it did as well as his legendary, Harald Ringstorff's predecessor, Harald Ringstorff.</seg>
<seg id="16">Otherwise Seafering has got the old feet and the chancellor Merkel gave the guilt on the bloodstream of the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their refugee policy, you "We're able to accelerate the rise of the populists, which is probably going to cost him now.</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU with its nickname, the Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has experienced, as it is, if one makes a wrong place in the right place of election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="19">She was invited twice as Chancellor Angela Merkel by the German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor Angela Merkel is in the northeast.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group did not agree that there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="21">"there was probably the majority from other federal states," accused Vincent Kokert, Secretary-General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in NDR.</seg>
<seg id="22">But nobody can listen to anyone from other corners of Germany, at least Angela Merkel.</seg>
<seg id="23">Otherwise the North East CDU identifies the usual election events on market places and shopping malls with parasols and balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">That, so Kokert, plays only a "subordinate role."</seg>
<seg id="25">The Union also noted that all of you wander out on the land that it needs to be very strict to find a wire to the people again.</seg>
<seg id="26">It is like the left, the SPD, the Greens: hardly available in the fields of the country.</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the Council of the CDU elector cocaert to his fellowsoldier is also self-deductible: "you have to go there where people are: dorffest, Golden weddings, each birthday party must be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">Because many of it stands on the game, Sellering has now called for a particularly dedicated election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In surveys, the Socialists and Democrats last were last with 22 percent behind the CDU (25) and just just ahead of the AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">With the 2011 election the SPD gained a clear increase of 35.6 percent before the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">The green, small party with seven percent in surveys, will be able to create the jump in the country's day.</seg>
<seg id="32">They are out of the holidays adversity, modern dreams and concealing their election campaign great part to the internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"online campaign" is called the President Claudia Müller.</seg>
<seg id="34">Otherwise, there are green electoral soldier on track search for locals with local vote.</seg>

<seg id="4">And what does the coalition partner say to all this?</seg>

<seg id="11">After the most recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach had a little time, before he presented his conclusions for the safety of the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="12">But they are so much more extensive.</seg>
<seg id="13">A lot has been announced, announced that a new security authority is to take care of encrypted communication, is not new.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is also not the fact that Germany must implement multiple EU directives and weapons law.</seg>
<seg id="15">The call for more video surveillance and staff for security authorities is not surprising.</seg>
<seg id="16">As part starts de Maizière is a second attraction for suggestions that were not to do with the SPD: he wants to punish sympathy for terror groups and jihadists with double citizenship to the German passport.</seg>
<seg id="17">"this will be difficult to score points for the SPD," the CDU male of the CDU.</seg>
<seg id="18">He still kept this for utopable and ask nothing, what did not have any opportunities in the coalition partner.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few new ideas presents de Maizière.</seg>
<seg id="20">They are partly in itself: he plans to process rapid procedures for shifts and more possibilities for the detention of humans in front of deportation.</seg>
<seg id="21">Before being transferred to the country, they are expected to check their smartphone in advance and check social media accounts for a security check.</seg>

<seg id="23">Some of them is politically and legally blinkel.</seg>
<seg id="24">Manches works even unbalanced and can be unbalanced.</seg>
<seg id="25">And with some points - at the unequal treatment of thought, the question arises: what does this have to do with safety and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">Yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the topics of refugees and terror.</seg>
<seg id="27">But it is not possible to speak that the attacks of Ansbach and Würzburg refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">In addition, many people in the presence of high refugee numbers should be worried about security.</seg>
<seg id="29">And things which the people employed people, now do not let rise up in election times.</seg>
<seg id="30">The inner safety is enormous in the focus.</seg>
<seg id="31">First the attacks in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.</seg>
<seg id="32">Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.</seg>
<seg id="33">The uncertainty is large.</seg>
<seg id="34">And yes, there are election campaign.</seg>

<seg id="37">Only a gardenier dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police, then demand through a security policy collection of some Unions Minister, in which the Ressortchefs also call a burka ban and a return from double citizenship.</seg>

<seg id="1">Distination plates: who can actually buy sound plates?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men love middle ages.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you divide the commentator to oversowing him under the pseudonym NonAlleone-notification-age age with harsh prescriptions, this statement is derived from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the most common revitalization of sound plates do not want to greet on a boom in millennials which wants to greet the rety of physical objects, but due to midlife-nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have recently bought a record, are all foresight according to the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group 18-24 is the most likely buyer group.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is also no hordes by hobbyists - it has a emotional meaning: older panel buyers retain their feelings more for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog would be a news report on TV, I would follow me the camera, while in the midst of a business road in Soho, a modest grey suit moves and wild, before I stop, my hands hold and some determinants such as: "so, let us take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even if the heart of Sohos is slow to its charm, hotels, restaurants and offices are now replenished the buildings where once independent salesare located - there is like a handful of fantastic top shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the camera of camera to turn the camera to the next part where I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to estimate their age and mind through observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I am from Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three men middle ages) into Reckless Records (data number: eight men middle age, a woman, probably around the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3.000 or 4.000 plates.</seg>
<seg id="17">This sound panels, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I'm not followed after home), with the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such a sizable number of albums and singles, is the result of his available income: it is now able to buy plates that he could not afford to buy them and to buy items that he sold, when he was young and pleite.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy, are of the late 60s, early '70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I probably was too young to buy them," he says.</seg>
<seg id="20">It is true to those who buy the plates, rather than verted and gladly spend time, and adds: "I smoke not and I drink not much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my aster.</seg>
<seg id="22">Wez, 25, who also works with Sister Ray, believes that many clients who meets the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media, people who have heard about the comeback and to see their old records again.</seg>
<seg id="24">Of the talks I have led, people usually have been buried in their collection in 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers that were once sold their records to buy converting CDs, now sell their CDs to buy their records. "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom to supporters of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional meaning of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It only takes some seconds in a business like phonica to detect that sheet business offers a soothing community of equations.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to Wez some of the older customers participated in the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some disk fans are overwhelmed from the digital world and want to cover the stability of trusted silverters, of objects, the lucky events.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think, sometimes it can be the colt of a void or the possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort," says Wez.</seg>
<seg id="32">That is with me as a collector so and I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal with spiritually.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social worker!" "" "still killed a staff of a record stack." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">There was a survey of ICM in April, that almost 50% of people who have bought a record in the last month they have not heard.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a record player that they never use them, while 7% of those who buy a record, have no record players.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the message I would probably look very concerned, while I blamed through a stack of Bossa Nova Kompilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works with sounds of the Universe (numbers: three of the aged ages) has performed a "trophy" of the Revival. "</seg>
<seg id="39">"" "" "" "someone came only recently here and said," "" "I don't have a record player, but I'd like to buy a radio record that I can put it into the shelf" "" "says he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it will definitely happen.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive, less musiklasty.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I have no record players."</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older, who first come slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, which has dedicated the sound plates for almost a whole floor, has a blower audience, when I am clean.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around 70, tourists, take pictures, teenagers and middle ages.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is a little less relaxed than in the aforementioned shops, Wild Beasts is the latest synthesizers and examinations packed pop instead of experimental jazz from the speakers - it's good to see such diversity in the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them is strange, but nagingly psychic traumata are hard to be fixed, if you still stands next to someone 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, runs within a few minutes of business and considered the variability for sale of the plates.</seg>
<seg id="49">It rather makes a piece of mannesting ship than a big buy.</seg>
<seg id="50">They don't deserve a lot, therefore the collection of records not a real option, says it.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs much.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to listen to music from one computer or to other way, but the beauty of plates is... "it drives with a twisted sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it really is unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business which is said that a new generation of record lovers have to be inspired by Urban Outams.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I give the ticket to number Jeans Hotpants, I observe a group of young teenies that grouped for a moment to buy polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter is superior to buy a Crosley record players.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left there is a staircase, a wall full of panels of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential panels for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">No one sees them - maybe because they are only pure decoratively, some as far above that it is impossible to apply it.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "panel art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But in view of that every attraction for these items mean more money for the sector and some customers could send in the depths of Socks for more, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="60">It's no surprise that a population group that has more time and money as others, also the one that is most suitable for luxury objects like plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even when my research shows that the results of YouGov agree that the results of YouGov are leaving, the large number of female collectors and record lovers that exist in reality, sheet business and online companies exist.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday morning with security not with the stroll through plate of the Berwick Street and the leaves through plates, while she resides the stubborn of an unusual, 30-year-old moderator who rises not over the shoulders of middle ages.</seg>

<seg id="9">Eight years ago she lost under Ryan every game with the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">They lost only one here.</seg>

<seg id="2">There will be no emotional gold than for those games and that wants to be hot.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first strokes until the last, 220 hard hieve, enter into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional significance in her golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even though it was only those who were sitting on the quiet, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the Trainers Robin Williams, was always present to the second Olympic woman in a row, the first women in the history of the British Sports, who laid such a measurement.</seg>
<seg id="5">Its dominance was absolutely, after all her 39.ter was not permitted, which is also an exemplary.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant Athletes, which reflects about the surface with elegance of goose, reflecting the way of the Arc de Triomphe.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind each gold in the ruin, a Bataillon is able to contribute to the incarmentary progress that make the difference and it was no beneficial than the trainer, who would not survive this day at all, when diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said he riseth.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer that is operable and they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not do it, he spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been quite bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a bit of the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio has luck that it could be the treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of season, so that the interruption has remained on a minimum, if it is the correct term under such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, therefore we had to go back soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in hospital and ran on the station around - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough.</seg>
<seg id="18">So it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">The rowing is already a challenge, but it makes it even bigger.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the insolitude of the victory, their first thoughts on Williams went a nervous morning to talk more than otherwise and tried to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">Stanning, who was a centurion at the Royal Artillery Regiment in a bet in Afghanistan, "I was a emotional wreck. that's perhaps somewhat extremely, but it means so much."</seg>
<seg id="22">It only repeats that how much I and Helen and Robin have worked with Robin and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="23">We were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin, we are no one, therefore a massive thanks to him. he is the best trainer in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I don't have a better person for trainer or a better trainer.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race over the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to compose, Stanning and Glover had a lot of reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were caught very at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen called "stay in the process, lead in the process."</seg>
<seg id="31">It's really important to let not take away.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not to make something Tolles.</seg>
<seg id="33">We wanted no fireworks today, we just wanted to achieve a good result, go out and win the race what we did.</seg>
<seg id="34">The pair will take a break for one year before making decisions of his future.</seg>
<seg id="35">Glover has to appear on a wedding next week, their own with the TV adventurer Steve Backshall.</seg>
<seg id="36">Now it wants to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I didn't want to say that that my last race was.</seg>
<seg id="38">That would have a much pressure.</seg>
<seg id="39">In London it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="40">It was all so new for me and I was so stressed.</seg>
<seg id="41">It took about four minutes.</seg>
<seg id="42">That feels so much better, "she said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, spirit, health: sing senior citizen good</seg>
<seg id="2">The singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp already accompanied her whole life: as young girl she was in school choir, in the teaching position. she sings the subject of music and today singing the 78-year-old in a senior citizen.</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing - emotional and physical," describes them.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful, and a total of living, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">Incidentally, they do good health and their spirit good.</seg>
<seg id="6">For singing is equal to several perspectives: a great hobby for seniors, Erhard Hackler of the German senior league.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most senior citizens sing in choir and sharing the joy of music, describes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through the regular meeting, senior citizens can hold social contacts and maintain.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because frequently social and family structures at the age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">This experience has also made Ursel Kipp in their choir: "to arrange them and to learn to learn on the other and to learn from another - a choir is a very special form of the compositions."</seg>
<seg id="11">Can sing in the positive sense, Hackler will sing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Because you are training a deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">He who calls his lung regularly, does not appear in everyday life as fast as the Puste.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even though it comes to get the sound of the voice at the age, singing is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">On older people, Singen often has a very special effect, Ursula Lenz says from the Federal Labour Community of Senior Citizens.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations the joint singing had a much higher level of job, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and leisure, explains them.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz is often observed that singing or listening of songs by older people will wake up many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">Through LiedTexts and especially melodies, people dementia cardiovascular disease for long-time events.</seg>
<seg id="19">Moreover, in addition, the head is demanded a special performance, explains Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, on their own voice and on a given rhythm, to suit the other singers - this is a big cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Just older people who live alone, do not practice themselves to concentrate on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition he goes through singing in the choir, comments Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem grows through the singing in a chorus.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show yourself: if I have long enough for something, I will get better and watch over me - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start with the singing, so there is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Whoever wants to test a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he believes, little talent, Lenz Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sings alone - at 50 singly people who listens to that if a tone goes beside it?</seg>
<seg id="29">In search of the matching offer, senior citizens have several options, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">Sings someone from the old circle in a nursing parenchman, you can easily connect.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer views of the choirs in the vicinity.</seg>
<seg id="32">He who wants to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or church leaders.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior citizens can also take place via the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">If you do not have access to the Internet, the family, friends or neighbors can pray with the help of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="35">Who will sing to sing, you should necessarily join a choir, enumbert Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing the soul well and has a good reputation - that applies to every age.</seg>

<seg id="8">When this week some users struck a filter, who gave them mud, false teeth, and wound pliers, there are some critics criticized a racist caricature of Asians - "yellowing layer."</seg>
<seg id="9">They asked whether these repetitive controversy was referred to a larger problem that the company has diversität.</seg>
<seg id="10">The messages and indignation were widely used on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat has said that it would have been disabled.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered a excuse: the filter was meant to be a tribute to Anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>

<seg id="20">When one of Snapchats filtering a picture shows that such things is difficult for a user, "so it is much more difficult that such things were unnoticed when it was earlier," said the 25-year Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday, Zhu decided Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineering in medium to extinguish her Snapchat account, and asking others to do the same.</seg>

<seg id="24">"either, they don't have any various representation of people with other skin colors, so that they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors that are working there, but not in positions, in which they are safe or safe to say about it."</seg>
<seg id="25">Other parts of their opinion, a complaint, the snapchat has mostly left unanswered.</seg>

<seg id="8">The ten-page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces.</seg>

<seg id="15">Republicans called the Task Force to life after giving them, analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will continue to be completed by more detailed knowledge during the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="17">Additional investigations of CentCom reports are in addition to the General Inspection of the Ministry of Defence in the Gange.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the News Service Committee published its own findings on Thursday that coincided with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "in the years 2014 and 2015, CentCom created a superbly reduced trial for the creation of enrolment enrolments to Isil and Iraqi security services," "" "the highest peak of democracy in the Council of the House of Representatives," "" "was a member at the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">This process, such a ship, "delayed the release of conscientious objection reports," the moral under analysts and "delivered little space for different opinions."</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Schiff took and the Democrats agreed to have no indications on a intervention of the White House at CentCom analysts, regarding a "certain political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the Congress were published on Tuesday through "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported investigations through the Pentagon's General Inspector, which were recorded after complaints from CentCom analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a press briecher of the Pentagon, announced that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the Congress, during the investigations of the general-speculurs.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "but he also gave me that" "" "experts sometimes quite digest opinions concerning the interpretation of complex data, and that the news services and the Ministry of Defence welcomed a controversial discussion of this important issues of national defence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have reported feedback on the question of a successful air campaign in Iraq and Syria (a claim that is made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence).</seg>

<seg id="1">In the heart of the Rage of the Olympic Games, the trampolines Zen</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, even as late it is, the Olympic Games are.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro are durable and insofter, a rapid relay between competition and streams.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is because the Olympic Fackel itself would be a burning rod, which protects from bracelet to swimmers to the Turner for the triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn the television to listen to a newspaper or listen to the conversation of your neighbours in the waiting-long in Coffeshop, without via Simone Biles, Katie Leaders or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there are Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a female of women with dimples, could well be sent under these known names to be sent to Prime Time, built by sponsors and well-being-TV advertising if he would be a swimmers, Turner or even Freal.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fought in the Olympic trampolines in gold.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the centre, in part in the shade there are sports, which are not widely accepted: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, Taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the chest and may rule it long.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I should make a modest arguments for my defined darling, then let me write the attention to the discrete charm of the trampolines.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampolines have already been a Olympic event since 2000, when it had his debut in Sydney, it was the last 16 years so bad that I had asked, did not know that there is a Olympiasportart at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional Ignorms.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the United States won athletes for competition, it has never won a medal in trampolines and had gained a athletes until 2012, who made it until the end of 2012.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to divide the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadian women to share for women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal in London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampolinjump has a certain exterior lateral, partly because it sounds for the unchecked ear for a clownsschool than those who sounds for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">In this spot I should admit that I'm not an expert, but only a little enthusiasm.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorous potential - the cartographical trembling of its never to end-like squalls - but also the Grazie of the turnaround and dive, the two sports, which combines it basically.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means so much means "jumping board."</seg>
<seg id="22">The winner jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot nearly up to 30 feet into the air and must take a number of falling movements (turning, trot and salcars) before being landing at the feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to the report, they are evaluated according to the version, Difficulty level and "flight time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Two-seater athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio against each other.</seg>
<seg id="25">The common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists will continue in their streches after gold, faster, upward and above, sometimes up to the finish, sometimes and back, back to the top and down on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They won't just hunt the finish line or the starting wall, but in the TV broadcast also another cavity destination: the world or the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="28">The goal-oriented streben is Nobel, admired, even fanatic - and it's enough to stir even a viewer's tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it's also what I think when watching these games like a little tired.</seg>
<seg id="30">Therefor, the trampoline offers a braplause.</seg>
<seg id="31">The Vektor of the trampolines centre is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or her prays, seemingly heavier as a astronaut, goes upward, then to the top, then effortlessly back to the top.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during practice there is no hectic attack on the target, no wolves in the distance, just the dreaming, elegant termination of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is so Zen as the contest for the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualifying and final wounds of the women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time, and the men on Saturday also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will exude the final time as part of a afternoon block on two days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the middle of the Olympia Manie they promise a quiet, nice moment, one who is likely to see in general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the consciousness can only be reached by the attacks and the object tification of male athletes - how to beat the male US Turner at the The Wall Street Journal recently - then Mr. Dooley awaits its air-round, new fan community.</seg>

<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators, demand political changes in Ethiopia, shooting on violent resistance to government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that only protectors are killed during clashes with the police in Schusschange.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia straight doing so?</seg>
<seg id="6">Over the past ten years, it was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid national economy with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the last months, protests against the government had struck the country and far spread themselves in more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week, thousands of people stormed in the streets and fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to human rights organisations, the answer of the government was unmerciful.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses testified that policemen had shot and killed thousands of unarmed protesters.</seg>
<seg id="11">In circulation, videos are on the protests that are probably from the last or beginning of this year, show how security professionals have forced to make young people with stalls, while these were forced to make a stand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN High Authority for Human Rights now demands a detailed analysis.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it was always difficult to agree on this land and future, it's even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populated country of Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and secret services collaborate closely with Ethiopians to combat terrorists in the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, when at all, get so much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded in a respectable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are generally quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia was anything like a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continued to continue the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, and dissidents were brought effective to silence.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile and put into prison, or pushed into the wilderness of the wilderness.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "if you suppress people and they don't have other options except to protest, it breaks out," "" "said Seasm Teshome" "", "a lecturer in central Ethiopian." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints, which cover everything from the ground use to the appreciation of the rain coalition, in regard to the power of the rained coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a broadly critical election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last registered office of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time the stresses descends along the border to Eritrea; a fight for these zag, controversial line urged in June hundreds of life.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analyst fears that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which could enforced more or less, the turbulences could take off and could be armed.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of despair after years of age can explode under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: Smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in the last few years, many Ethiopians were able to communicate with the social media, as cheaper smartphones were always more common and improved to the Internet services.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government has access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do in regular intervals, mostly with protrusts, many people can still communicate over internet proxies that hide themselves.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians gave to that they were so-assembled to protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there are more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two major ethnicities in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since apples of all prospering the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia, mainly Christian high-countries, in politics and economy, while they live the Oromos, of which many Muslims are and live in flat areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this also changes.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are involved in coordination under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests were held in the areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which accounts for around 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military, in the service and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was up to his death in a non-public disease in 2012, 17 years of Ethiopians, and prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was viewed as a tactical genius, a man that could think about corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts predict that it was especially tolerated in it, to perceive early signs of unsatisfaction and to use special attendant to work opponents and make them unharmful.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the present regime is missing in this basic course," Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst.</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia, new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen out of relatively untransparent reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Other than Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of Northern Alps, Mr Hailemariam comes from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analyst say that it is not enjoying the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many people fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time that Ethiopia had been such an uproar in 2005, after thousands of elections protested according to the details of analytics apparently from the government and then stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the subsequent raids, many protesters were killed, even if it were less than in the last months and that time of the unrest went relatively rapidly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Experts's experts for their visionary infrastructure plan, as well as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in poverty.</seg>
<seg id="53">But apparently this has not prevented the intentions of the internal disappearance of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And she takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month the protesting in Gondar, a amharic city, by Tigray guided businesses and hatred opposite the Tigray will always exercise in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analyst say that protests around the United States and other Western allies bring to a separate position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as a base for Dronenarians over the neighboring Somalia, even if it has recently healed that it closed on this basis.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West wants to support democracy, he doesn't want to pull his ally in a volatile area.</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his assertion Obama was founded ISIS "Sarcasus"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump attempted to scatter the last controversy that his campaign puts his campaign that his multiple reclaimed assertion, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the "founder" of the Islamic State of Islamic State, not seriously.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification designed new questions about the communication capabilities of the presidential candidate of the Republican, whether it is clear and understandable to communicate with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings his mitrians that endeavour to take him during an eventful phase in protection to explain which he could not have meant.</seg>
<seg id="5">After he had made the assumption of a campaign event on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump committed referring to the claim on Thursday and insisted on Thursday that he really does not intend to signify the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in a morning native to Friday, Mr. Trump, he was simply excellent.</seg>
<seg id="7">Contrary to the previous day, Mr. Trump said that Mr. Trump said in a number of interviews, he thought that he was entirely serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative Radiomoderator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help usher, the statement weakening to destroy him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy the Republican Presidential candidate in nothing.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism of Mr. Trump down to Mr. Trump, while he tries to direct his campaign to the economic situation due to its campaign.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton held speeches about the business situation in Michigan in this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again.</seg>
<seg id="12">Talking about Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinique would lead to higher taxes, and that he has found long speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm at his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he went down a strong critique on himself when he meant, Mrs. Clintons of emails, but he explained later "of course, I said the sarcopic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the language limits in politics and return to demand as required.</seg>

<seg id="17">But I think he is smart enough to stop his testimonies, so that they can interpret it in different way.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of the tone to sharpen the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has accepted an even unkenness sound because its conversion rate passed away.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey of NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, which was published on Friday, showed a lead with a large margin in the Federal States North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado, and a head-on-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump generally tried to apologize for his provocative postings, he charged his critics to understand his statements or to understand his humor.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he has strengthened himself in the focus of the attention during the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps Scherze had brought up his loyals Mitstreite into the uncomfortable situation to have to stand to him whatever the provocal will like his statements.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trumps famous intercession, gave great efforts to defend the candidates today in a CNN interview from Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments" says Mr. Giuliani, so he said to the correctness of Mr. Trumps declared whether Mr. Barack Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in this sense that ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization that he called them back-benkler, completely wrong, and therefore it happened, because he moved the troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most mainstream republicans try to argue that Mrs. Clinton served as an Foreign Minister, it was ISIS allowed to spread out the situation in the Middle East, aggressive under control.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump dropped his attacks on the media and threw it to them on each of his words, and against him voreengineering.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he mocked the" poor, "" "" poor, "" "" TV experts who try to understand him, "" "" you cannot believe it! "" "" "" "</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the oldest cyclone is nearly 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland's surface usually come to the surface only in the winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board of the Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and swim with a 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland can only get offspring after 150 years.</seg>
<seg id="7">Formerly floating of the Greenland on the ground of the North Atlantic crossing, in an hour he comes from an average of 1,220 meters.</seg>
<seg id="8">When it depends on it, the five-meter-long animal accelerates to a full 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a Robbe.</seg>
<seg id="9">But this loneliness of longevity seems to be a sponsorship for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen conducted by the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues in the journal "Science" in any case of a Greenland, 3392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," commented Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, this life span which means a world record.</seg>
<seg id="12">Indeed, the evolutionary converges already suspected that Greenland will be stony old.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only lacked the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland is difficult to observe and ultimately, in the Eismeer, they live mainly in the polar sea before the thin minished coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because it prefered water temperatures of six degrees Celsius, dive on the surface usually only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers have correspondingly looked according to the lifestyle of Greenland's lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their era emptoss them, when they were six animals in front of Svalbard, with a transmitter.</seg>
<seg id="18">Spoil these sharks: in the stomach of a animal, researchers found the remains of a Robbe, another one had swallowed up the pine bones of a young iron.</seg>
<seg id="19">Maybe they hunt them sleeping animals or patrols at the bottom of the ice-sea and look for Kadcasses, from higher water-layers according to the bottom.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland hairs, who took fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in Greenland or Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 cm long, while the largest 502-centimeter measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lens core with the carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens is already produced before the birth of the sharks, which contained therein later no more.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had a lot of carbon-14 in the lens core.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons attempts to deteriorate the atmosphere of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">With 220 centimetres of length, the lentil core contained a low surplus of carbon-14 from nuclear weapons, it is likely to celebrate its 50th birthday with its investigation in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">In their lens core they had a normal carbon-14 quantities that arises through cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the Carbon-14 clock showed an age of 335 years for a 493 centimetre long Greenland, while the record shark is likely to be 392 centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland female had only been postponed when they are longer than four meters, it was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to arrange a age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably stood at the threshold for sexual immaturity and at the age of 156 years, Greenland-hairy can be seen at least one and a half centuries.</seg>
<seg id="32">This should also be the world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methane cares live primarily in icy waters, is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also the previous record holder, a 211-year old Greenland, on the neck of the neck, a 120 year-old harpoon tip, was caught on Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Through the low temperatures there often also the organism of living animals living on savings.</seg>
<seg id="36">So you mature later - and alarms slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals often are particularly large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume is much faster than its surface due to the pet's heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of a gram of mouse is therefore much larger than a gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal is therefore more dangerous and should focus on that as possible as many descendants as possible," the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein. "</seg>
<seg id="42">A very large animal should have to invest his resources in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="13">In fact, the new mobile phone could be sent and received a lot: SMS and emails sent and received, also by fax it was the Communicator.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even the access to web pages was possible via HTML browsers, even querizing slowly.</seg>
<seg id="15">A calculator was available, an digital address book and an electronic calendar.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna, and the mobile phone was similar to a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then there were a small keyboard and a black-and-white screen.</seg>
<seg id="18">Very proud was the price: 2700 D-Mark, i.e. about 1400 Euro.</seg>
<seg id="19">The average price of a smartphone in Germany was €392 in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody could do in August 1996 that the Communicator would be the beginning of the smartphone era.</seg>
<seg id="21">Ever since then everything is different.</seg>
<seg id="22">The smart phones are a success story, although not for Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The mobile map of the Finns experienced an unprecedented design, was finally sold to Microsoft.</seg>
<seg id="24">The market today rule the provider that were all much later than Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="25">Ever and everywhere, that is today for very many people everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="26">In 2015 there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="27">Sold, about 1.4 billion units, on Samsung and Apple, of which 555 million units were sold alone.</seg>

<seg id="4">The incident happened on the A1 nearby Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.</seg>
<seg id="5">A woman placed in the Dunklen "in an act of despair" on the streets and were hit by several cars, the police spoke in Vaud.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is obvious that a Swiss woman at the age of 49, which was passed by several vehicles, including a load car, wanted to kill himself.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was likely to be inhabitable.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of the Venus on the basis of tools and algorithms that were similar to those of climatic researches.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-density atmosphere could be detected in similar conditions.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously pointed out that the slow revolution of Venus could be explained by its density atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin, similar atmosphere and slowly but slowly.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably pointed out more dry regions than the Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to give life to life and protected against rapid evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">Early Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30 percent matter.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS-Modellsimulation, the slow revolution of Venus provides their daily site of the sun for almost two months," declared GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds, which works like a rain screen to shielding the surface of a large part of the solar heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result are average temperatures, which are some degree cooler than those of the earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought a history of the Venus, which the evolution resembles that previously assumed by planetary guides.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was presumably mainly habitable, the Venus was exposed to much heat and ultraviolet light over the course of several billion years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Her oceans evaporation and her water vapor was burned down from ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">When her Hydrogen dropped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide, with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus as we know it today.</seg>
<seg id="17">The researchers distributed the results of their new Venus climate model in Geophysical Research AG.</seg>

<seg id="2">Honda HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday applications</seg>
<seg id="3">In the small HR-V Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupe, and also the versatility of a minivans.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sounds quite reasonably priced, but the HR V, which was built on the same new platform as the new jazz, has actually proved to be extremely flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although the only 1.60 m high HR-V is rather small, the passengers have a lot of space both in the first row and there is a lot of space in the rear.</seg>
<seg id="6">The materials of the interior space are well finished and work comfortable, only the cockpit surface falls off there.</seg>
<seg id="7">The HR-V is much more versatile than comparable vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is not only a boot space of 453 l at high and 1026 l when folded back lock is available, but there is the "Magic Seats."</seg>
<seg id="9">This is less magically, than it sounds: the seat surface of the back bench can be seen like Kinosessel and offer it storage space that is height up to ceilings 1,24 m high.</seg>
<seg id="10">The boot space is well-loaded, but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The 1.6-liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed range.</seg>
<seg id="12">But he is likely to do some quieter work.</seg>
<seg id="13">The everyday consumption of 4,7 l / 100 km is gratifying.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is another motor car: a 1.5 liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp.</seg>
<seg id="15">A four-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">The handling is balanced, a good compromise between dynamic and comfort.</seg>
<seg id="17">But the steering system is likely to be direct.</seg>
<seg id="18">The equipment can be opened in the tested top variant "Executive" no wishes.</seg>
<seg id="19">The security systems is one of the City emergency assistance systems (working with tempo. 32), the collisions system and trace assistant.</seg>
<seg id="20">Sometimes, the collisions provoked me, because he has been rated as "herannahing Objects" at the rankings.</seg>
<seg id="21">Very reliable works the remote control assistant.</seg>
<seg id="22">And intelligent speed regulator reacts to the traffic sign detection and throttle when needed.</seg>
<seg id="23">The full connectivity is available only for the top features: 7-inch touch screen, Navi, App Integration and More.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB- and a HDMI jack are under the armrest and are therefore a bit awkward.</seg>
<seg id="25">The approximately 29000 Euro for the well-equipped top-diesel are fine.</seg>
<seg id="26">Who doesn't want to invest so much, will receive the gasoline engine from 20,000 euros, diesel starting from 23000 Euro.</seg>
<seg id="27">The engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the HR-V Honda offers lots of versatile and everyday use.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the evening you can stay for hours, at night there is hours for hours, in the morning far from the wake of the wake-up of sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">That is everything else than relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one of these problems are in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about one quarter of adult sleep disturbances and more than ten percent will feel free, or permanently as non-relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleeping problems or sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disturbances, and it can endure them diverse causes, emphasises Hans-Günter Weeß, member of the German Society for Sleep and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">Whatever you understands, but is the insomnie, thus an inpower and a sleeping annoying.</seg>
<seg id="8">Just the sleep sleep, many people find as harmless or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the German house medical association with practice in the Lower Saxony Varel.</seg>
<seg id="9">What's behind sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disturbances are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind it, organic, psychic or behaviour-related factors, but also prescription drugs.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not rare, the sleeping expression of another disease is not rare.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early spring is especially common with depression," says Weeß.</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors need one another.</seg>
<seg id="15">Those who have a herniated disc may be poorly lie, wakes every two to three hours, and begins to greet over all day problems and care about everyday problems, Weeß is an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">From when should one eat with sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="18">If you should not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week, should not be impacted on the day should leave the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look completely different: one is beaten, tired, tired, sleepy, has trouble with the attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical symptoms such as stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">In order to linking sleeping, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">As treatment options include behavioral changes, a cognitive behavioural therapy or also medications - classic sleep tablets only in exceptional case and for a maximum of two weeks - inquire.</seg>
<seg id="22">The dormitories are hardly in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary or medical centre of the Charité University Medicine Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">That is why it should be used at bedtime in sleep problems, avenge Weeß.</seg>
<seg id="24">The problem can clarify if the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should sleep in sleep, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For examining in sleep laboratory rates medical advice, for example, with breathing difficulties, if necessary, if necessary, if sleeping in sleep or if you don't find the cause of a sleeping disorder, Fixe explains.</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the study.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only don't make a lunchap," says Fietze.</seg>
<seg id="30">After shutdown, you go to the bed at its normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">In addition to the electrodes at the body you carry a nose goggles, a chest strap and a antennler on the fingers.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera also features the sleeping ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can I get the problems in the handle?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of positions to which you can put for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Weeß counts on: regular sleeping and rising times, not to sleep long in bed, not to sleep in the bed, don't have to sleep on the clock, don't start to calculate, and that's all and not to be eligible.</seg>

<seg id="4">Opposite a Lidl, which is also to be demolished soon, it is already built: by 2017 a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be created.</seg>
<seg id="5">Articles about this "trendy district," how the competent real estate company Friedrichshain are described in the last weeks using burning cars.</seg>
<seg id="6">Reason is the house with number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents are occupied, but in the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, the Innensenator's handle had multiple awards for a tough race against the project, the area known as "no-Go-Zone" for policemen and the 94 known as the starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">After 22 June the rooms were vacated on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 officers, according to the official statements, according to 30 to 40 civil servants and three freighth cars, closed parts of the street and held a visitor to access the house with number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile in its renovated building workers in the order of the unknown house owners the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin administrative court decided that the clearance had been illegally illegally, and a day later, police and builders filed under the Jubel of sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this summer afternoon the street seems peacefully: parents are walking with children, people sitting on the brush in front of the houses in the sun, others entertained in late Späti.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the skin projects there are primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left violence is not the main purpose of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in the "Kiez" since 1999, and Jana *, which attracts three children here, especially from the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the residents of the skin projects they share the concern before rising and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It sounds not just after a pinch, who wish for majority of polishing Policies in front of the left side.</seg>
<seg id="16">The trench, which of the Berlin inner enator and the police are invaded and their neighbours therefore does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the East of Berlin actually was a traditional working district, which even today has a lower average population in comparison to the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="18">Also in fact, in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire mazzer street, close to the Riga.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainz was cleared under great police, many of the projects were legalized in the Riga, and are still inhabited by people who had occupied them 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the neighborhood has become increasingly part of the magnets for tourists and election liner from all over the world: with them now share living from the GDR-time and former house occupied their pups.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also noticeable during the rent which has risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Rigs are attacked as symbols for this development: one will recognize them out of the disc or freshly coated facades, which were rejected with shades.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other street was mentioned so often along with the words "left-autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">A reason why not all neighbors who have seen as a problem, could not necessarily be affected by the criminality: criminal offences such as human injuries, according to statistics, nearly exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the offenders make damages of nondamage, the tends to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a rental building for 17 years in a rental next to the controversial 94, uncertainty cannot be given.</seg>
<seg id="27">The men of violence is crucial: the people in the 94 are their neighbours therefore that have not been destined.</seg>
<seg id="28">Also the famous sparked cars give it directly in the Rigs no longer anymore.</seg>
<seg id="29">For who studied Architectin, her road no criminal point, on the contrary: "here is one another, lives together on the street and gets more of each other than what else."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is deliberately moved to the Riga Road - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">In this reason, it was so important that the residents of the people returned to its road: from the police, politics and the media, who in July all the devisitation of the city suddenly demands.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents such as Neugebauer will continue to be taken away: due to recent reconstructions in former building gaps, which penetrate the old residents.</seg>
<seg id="33">"these are ultimately the condominiums that are not interesting for many here - there are more people who are not so good," says it.</seg>
<seg id="34">"violence and destruction can I not be highly guish."</seg>
<seg id="35">But what can we do if any one never stops?</seg>
<seg id="36">There will be frustration in all sides, even with the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">For tracked, which contested over color-bombs, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the pinch.</seg>
<seg id="38">Who attracts himself, should be aware of this - just like someone who is in a kpaddle quarter, there can be poorly complain about noise.</seg>
<seg id="39">All only asked with pre-names were asked, not to be named with their correct name</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is a refugee student</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the responsibly in terms of integration and organisers.</seg>
<seg id="3">In addition, she is a social worker.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July Annika Deuschle has been the refugee status for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">Social pedagogue supports the team of administration to Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees himself as a contact partner for all actors: refugees, working for refugees, administration, authorities and those who are still mixed.</seg>
<seg id="7">REGINE customer of the working group indicates that honors are more than thankful that Deuschle is now there, the purpose of pleasures wok, which has especially a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">So, some - less spawful than rather than much on the pledge-reaching reserves - meant that the administration wanted to write the place.</seg>
<seg id="9">Looking for an administration force with a talent for languages and people, associated with a long-term experience in the field of social work, just a eiving Wollstau.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administration work is not its central area, calls Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is to organization, work with the people on site and also behind the scenes and network activity.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31 year old has been there for around six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is limited to a 50-percent spot on three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was highest time," says Regine customer that Annika Englishman honors and superofficial actors supported.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are large and small issues, organizational, human and understanding problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon we are new containers in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">A serious problem has been recognized for some time to find apartments for the interferries which have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for the connection washers.</seg>
<seg id="19">You need to place the refugees in their own or rented rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The costs for the construction, rent or renovation of these accommodation must be borne by the community.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility is changed from the country estate with community and job center.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not each landlord wants to offer its apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search have been designed for some time than very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto finds no private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">So far it did not work so far, one would be referred to private apartments so Deuverle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Hence, communities must be redone, as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So a new container will soon be placed in the washing machine.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, are Regine customer and Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a fixed lead, there are internships, training places, training places, one-euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants which have to be established or established.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places were well" reported Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help housemasters, do-profit work - and motivates and very tidy, as Annika Englishle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">It hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive outer effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">This is "no employment therapy."</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not work yet.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day requires a fixed structure, say Deuverle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People ought to develop an omiveness feeling.</seg>
<seg id="38">So it offers offers such as sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rar.</seg>
<seg id="40">So you can jump in administration and honorary funds.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling they are in Germany and welcome them.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">You must explain the refugees that it takes time and take a sense of sense, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Who sometimes know the feeling that he could not work in Urbach, they do not work and be unprofitable, he will never integrate.</seg>
<seg id="45">The distinct majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">Problem cases, however, says customer honest, "People, where nothing goes nothing." the work of Deuverle and customer is therefore always to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is a "Mammuttask."</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: did the two incidents respond to radicalization, also in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "Regine customer" "" "says," "" "what mancher can call you." "" "a remnant could" "" "could not close them." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">Lowering the mustard the helpers are already.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents have also been subject to refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They had the fear that the attack they complete them completely.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So you need to spend main and honorary volunteers on site and in the region after activities.</seg>
<seg id="56">In the background they always have in the background that soon a new school of refugees and migrants to Urbach could come.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need an upper limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">The question is clear to answer this question.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually it is unfair to set them helpers on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"" "" "" "in Urbach we have not arrived here where we want to go," "" "says Annika Deuschle." ""</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">REGINE customer also makes it clear that the Urbacher was already utilized to integrate the previous people in rational.</seg>
<seg id="63">There are currently around 100 people, the majority of young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But if people are in need to help them, both women are united.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there is no simple answers.</seg>
