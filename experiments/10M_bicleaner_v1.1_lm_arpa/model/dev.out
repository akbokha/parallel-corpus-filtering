Obama welcomes Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
these two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as Teh@@ er@@ ans of dest@@ abil@@ ize measures in the Middle East .
but at the meeting the conflict is supposed to go to the conflict with the Palestinians and the controversi@@ al two @-@ states .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been e@@ ager for years .
Washington is critic@@ izing the ongoing settlement of Israeli and th@@ rows Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of peace during the peace process .
by the Obama mentioned deal , the Iranian nuclear programme has deterior@@ ated the relationship between the two .
in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu has held an invitation to the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in front of the US Congress held a controversi@@ al speech which was given as aff@@ r@@ ont to Obama .
the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting had refused to the forth@@ coming election in Israel .
to be shot in a emergency call , he shot his gir@@ l@@ friend
in a emergency call , Professor Sh@@ annon refers to a slightly pri@@ z@@ able voice of the police that he shot his gir@@ l@@ friend and that the officials would have to come to his house .
it was important to emphas@@ ize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and likely to be excited , and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone .
within the house , the officials found the dead of A@@ my Pr@@ ent@@ iss and a handwritten note : &quot; I loved it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed from Lamb .
there was no reference to that from two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , instructed , already 300 miles traveled to the school premises , where he was shot after the police a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , shot at the door to his office and killed .
Delta State University pol@@ ari@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that the Department of Ophthalmology heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that He has taken out the cat@@ astroph@@ ic emergency call sometime after that .
until the end of the day there was a further death : in the Lamb , when the police seized him .
one day after the shooting location in the university , students and do@@ z@@ ers sub@@ du@@ ed to hide themselves behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of it , signi@@ fying what Lamb motiv@@ ated .
the details published by the investigations at the two ends of the State , such as those , students and employees who knew him , helped us to draw a picture of a talented but perhaps difficult teachers .
students said that they were looking forward to his teaching .
the police in G@@ auti@@ er , where Pr@@ ab@@ iss died , did not have a history of violence or a criminal record .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt himself mentioned documents in a written book in which he mentioned the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which he distributed his academic life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both institutes in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose teaching staff members comprises 17 members , and many students visited courses of both .
at the same time there were some in@@ clin@@ ations for problem@@ atic behavi@@ ors .
a student , bran@@ don Be@@ en , the Lamb praised , said that he seemed to be a little nerv@@ ous and nerv@@ ous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , told that he told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
he had asked the Delta State University in order to take sick@@ ness for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
in this year he taught only two Online courses .
latest changes in the employment policy of the University revealed that the Promotion , for the Lamb is so hard worked for him no guarantee for an automatic way to an adoption as Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ for@@ ge said that he did not know anything from a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that may not answer any more .
after the escape from the campus , the police took later in Lam@@ bs , when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ sas .
before he was arrested , he killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents &quot; house at the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ er Meth@@ il Johnson .
his car ran still in the entrance .
it was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house but Johnson said they knew that he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew in the area .
in 2009 he began working at the university , which 3,@@ 500 students enrolled in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and education .
he received his doctorate in spring in education .
one of the long @-@ time friends of Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , char@@ ism@@ atic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said it was 15 and he was 20 when they met together with joint friends .
they and their friends were in High School , and he was the cool older guy who tried some years to teach their guitar play .
at that time he was the female of women .
all of the girls r@@ ush@@ es when he was there , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in Jackson &apos;s Jackson town of Bran@@ don .
Lamb and Pr@@ ent@@ iss have apparently some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate of a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog named Light@@ ning that lived with them in the brick building that ad@@ joining a Ba@@ you in G@@ auti@@ er .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ ent@@ iss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said they were di@@ vor@@ ced 15 years ago but got friends and had a daughter who had now been 19 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed at the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ ste@@ en said he never met him , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he list@@ ened to that he was interested in music and playing blues .
Lamb met Pr@@ ab@@ iss , when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail had raised both on a summer @-@ mill@@ ennium three years ago .
later they played together the one or another gig .
O &apos;@@ Ass@@ en said that his daughter writes and s@@ ings her own music .
Pr@@ ent@@ iss was a nurse , worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ keeper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Jul@@ ep Room , a weak illuminated bar close to G@@ auti@@ er , said that he was from Lamb and Pr@@ ent@@ iss Night in the night 5th september for his guitar and harmon@@ ious game ended prior to an extraordinary audience .
there were no signs that anything had not voted .
&quot; just a happy pair , &quot; he said .
we were on cleaning and cor@@ rid@@ ors together .
I mean , they both had a good sense of sh@@ ear .

Michael J. Fox sho@@ cks about his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sat in the theater on the Roy@@ als , and I perc@@ eive that the seat is apart from me , and it became clear to me that Princess Diana is sitting next to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the film starts , and it comes to me in the sense that I am an simul@@ ated g@@ aps and a arm length of it being removed with the Princess of Wales on a Date .

UN Staff says , there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary @-@ General Ban Ki @-@ moon says , his response to Russia &apos;s reinforced military support for Syria : &quot; there is no military solution for almost five years of conflict , and more weapons will be wor@@ sen for millions of people .
the UN Group calls for all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to un@@ ite and integ@@ rative negotiations on the Fin@@ ally a political solution .
ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet foreign minister of five permanent member states of the United States , Russia , China , Great Britain , and France - on the si@@ del@@ ines of the General Assembly , to meet again this month in order to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ t@@ ted that the shift in the Council and the Syrian authorities and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are in@@ separable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ban challenged five permanent members , in order to show the same solidarity and unity in Syria , which they have demonstrated in the achievement of a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 Shift indicates that Donald Tr@@ ump seriously begin .
some have tried to draw him as a flop .
others have taken him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
however , no matter how some rep@@ ublic@@ ans attempts to drag and Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ais@@ les down to bottom , it did not work .
ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit field , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for chances of nom@@ ination of real estate @-@ Mog@@ ul@@ s .
of course it is too early in the election period .
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump probably will win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts emphas@@ ize that at that time in 2011 Rick Per@@ r@@ ys led the lead to the raising of Herman Cain , of which no one has won only one state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have strug@@ gled in a general election .
but out@@ ings groups such as J@@ eb Bus@@ h@@ s Super P@@ AC and the conservative Economic Group Club for Growth now realize tr@@ um@@ ps of per@@ sever@@ ance and start to exp@@ ire its dollar .
here are some recent surveys to indicate that the real estate business gu@@ l is not only a temporary phase :
Tr@@ um@@ ps Pop@@ ular values have turned around 180 degrees .
just before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his candi@@ dat@@ ure in mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth @-@ University revealed that only two of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans have positive the real estate business .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
by the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
now six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three of ten say that they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in the early States .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac voting in I@@ owa has found that 60 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of the GO@@ P turn@@ out GO@@ P were happy with Tr@@ ump than candidates .
in a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week 67 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , they would be either &quot; thr@@ illed &quot; or &quot; satisfied , &quot; if Tr@@ ump would be nominated .
only two of 10 would say they would be anno@@ ying &quot; if he was the candidate .
only Ben Car@@ son makes about the same enthusiasm such as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent said they would be &quot; excited &quot; vs. 40 percent , they would say the same over Tr@@ ump ) .
the next thing in enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 % of the republi@@ can voters say that they would be &quot; dis@@ content &quot; or &quot; disp@@ le@@ ased , &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the field , would become a candidate .
a majority of the rep@@ ublic@@ ans can not see tri@@ um@@ ps temper@@ ament as problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump refused to discri@@ min@@ ate statements for his bomb defeat , 52 percent of the rep@@ ublic@@ ans ir@@ relevant voters think that the real estate business gu@@ l had the right temperature for a President , as ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number applies in the first pre @-@ voting state of the nation , State of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans think that he had the personality for a commander , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
in fact , 44 percent would think that he did not have the personality to effectively perform his function and almost six of 10 in@@ depend@@ ant estimates that his temper@@ ament is not at the White House P@@ asse , as ABC / Post .
republi@@ can voters draw up the idea .
if they keep up their jel@@ ly , republi@@ can elec@@ torate Tr@@ ump for real .
when asked if they will be asked , who wins the GO@@ P Nom@@ ination , say after a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change since the time when four out of the ten end of July their money came to J@@ eb Bush .
complete dis@@ closure : GO@@ P @-@ voters had not the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at this point in the last cycle , four of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans , Rick Perry won the nom@@ ination to compete against just 28 % for the final candidate .
nevertheless , it demonstrates that a multip@@ lic@@ ity of GO@@ P @-@ elec@@ tors Tr@@ um@@ ps are viewing as pl@@ au@@ sible .
even if the Republi@@ can gathered themselves together to collect another candidates , Tr@@ ump hasn &apos;t added any more .
some experts refer to that the frag@@ ile field probably comes to Tr@@ um@@ ps leadership while the Anti @-@ Tr@@ ump support is diff@@ ers distributed over a dozen other candidates .
but a survey of the Mon@@ mouth @-@ University at the beginning of September shows that hypo@@ thet@@ ical head @-@ in @-@ head @-@ races between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump applies the majority support .
he before Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points advantage , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before the edge of Paul , John Casino and Chris Christ@@ ie 33 points .
it is a head @-@ to @-@ head @-@ race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who hits it ?
Ben Car@@ son would pick up business@@ man with 19 points in a hypo@@ thet@@ ical head @-@ on @-@ head @-@ race .
a vast majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans says that they have formed their opinions .
a new survey of C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday indicates that only slightly more than half of the voters will support Tr@@ ump , say that they have fixed their voices .
of course , plenty of happen to change that , and no one can really say , never change the mind .
46 percent said they leave the door open to change other candidates .
nevertheless , Tr@@ um@@ ps is the strongest competition at the moment the other out@@ sider forces , neuro@@ sur@@ geon Ben Car@@ son , but elec@@ tors that they have formed their opinions were twice as frequent for Tr@@ ump .
six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say they coinci@@ de with Tr@@ ump with the issue of Im@@ migration .
since Donald Tr@@ ump lived in his election campaign two months ago , &quot; rape &quot; was the immig@@ ration turning point in the public dis@@ course towards 2016 .
some are concerned that the bomb explo@@ si@@ vity of Tr@@ ump @-@ decisive His@@ p@@ ano @-@ Americans will be remote @-@ controlled by the Republi@@ can Party and to damage a new @-@ orient@@ ated action .
but after the new ABC / Post @-@ survey on Monday , six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans , they coinci@@ de with Tr@@ ump with questions to emig@@ ration .
as long as the immig@@ ration remains in the ramp , Donald Tr@@ ump seems to do so .
the fru@@ stration on the government refers to new resi@@ stances .
at Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , about half of the support of Republi@@ can elec@@ tors , mainly due to their out@@ sider status .
six out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say in the new Mont@@ t @-@ survey on ABC / Post , they prefer to be a political out@@ sider as someone with government experience .
and they are also angry with Washington .
a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines Properties / Bloom@@ berg in I@@ owa for two weeks ago shows that three out of four I@@ owa rep@@ ublic@@ ans over the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in the Congress are fru@@ str@@ ated with 54 percent , &quot; and 21 percent . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential neighbor@@ hoods in Germany
here in the Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg is the most expensive residential community with a view over the North Sea .
in the road it costs a square meter of a hom@@ eless luxury on average 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt we have limited to objects with natural limits , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore it is the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows where special layers is one square metres of the majority .
of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student union in Munich are not really small .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top living locations , one of the price is just like pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate provider Angel &amp; Ful@@ ler has published a list of the most exclusive German sites - with square met@@ ering prices in del@@ ight@@ ful heights .
since there are several tenth euros of euros nothing - per square meter , well stated .
but good , who can aff@@ ord it ...
by the way : Munich is not a while at the top .
Champions League : Bavaria @-@ dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
two @-@ fold sc@@ orer in Pi@@ raeus : Bavaria @-@ star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a happy ref@@ res@@ h by Thomas Müller was the way to the FC Bayern regional way to a earned 3 : 0 at the Olympi@@ ak@@ os Pir@@ ae@@ us - then it ran .
a sover@@ eign kick @-@ off of the Champions League @-@ season .
the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze have a dream start to the &quot; Mission Milan &quot; by pir@@ ates .
the team of Trainer P@@ EP Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won her kick @-@ off game in the Champions League at the Greek record Master Olympi@@ ak@@ os in hot atmosphere with rub@@ b@@ ish double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ min + 2 ) and i@@ at@@ ry things ( 8@@ 9th ) earned with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth star in series will be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola finally wants to get the stern @-@ pot@@ ted to Munich .
Müller began his 28 award in the Champions League to the Bavarian leadership of the Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ go@@ al@@ keeper who pass one in the face of the World Champion in his praise .
&quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate it , &quot; said Bayern @-@ captain Philipp Lah@@ m before the game in Kar@@ ai@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 gold @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich @-@ awa@@ ited word .
it showed a concentrated and dedicated idea to sh@@ it .
pir@@ ate won his youngest six home games in the Royal class , among them known as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 , Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) is proud .
but the Bayern , seven Europ@@ ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams would not be defeated , did not want to be the next sacrifice .
they had cour@@ age@@ ous , with their obvious effort but often rum@@ oured in works .
the attacks were often incorporated at Lin@@ ks@@ n@@ ell Douglas Costa , who rarely met with the former Braun@@ schwei@@ ger Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ aou@@ i .
Müller had from right more luck than his face left in the left eye on the left wing of the left wing .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the world champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half of one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first , as the Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer Brown the head ball of Poland was defeated by the line ( 26 ) .
then by direct removal , the go@@ al@@ keeper he par@@ ked with the kne@@ e ( 3@@ 5. ) .
even though the Bavaria moved to domin@@ ating game in Bavaria , he was able to set pir@@ ates needle &apos;s sti@@ ve minds .
but Manuel New was refer@@ enced at Tor@@ hil@@ ter Manuel New .
such a shot by Ide@@ ye on the l@@ ash@@ ore ( 5@@ 6th ) .
before New Gu@@ ardi@@ ola put a quarter with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng who did it well .
Mario Göt@@ ze , post @-@ cul@@ ari@@ al problems back in the cad@@ re , sitting at first outside .
the World Cup , however , was given until after the final training of green light , &quot; says Sport@@ chief Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; who wants to make something different from it , isn &apos;t mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot;
in his first change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him as he brought the King@@ sley Com@@ an for his nom@@ ograph@@ ed Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ .3 ) .
Göt@@ ze came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6. ) and made it all @-@ clear , 13 minutes later , and by El@@ f@@ meter Müller there was a dr@@ au@@ ght .
before the game it was in the stadium on Kra@@ wa@@ ist .
after a smaller group of sight@@ se@@ cular Bayern fans in their audience are evi@@ den@@ ced by host Pi@@ raeus with words and shou@@ ting prov@@ oked , the security forces attacked and went with impact resistance against the Munich tra@@ ilers .
at least one Bavaria @-@ fan was transported from the stadium there .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk to lose teeth
not everyone who is smo@@ kes , not only the lung , but also the teeth - having a Potsdam &apos;s long @-@ term study .
good news : when ren@@ unci@@ ation , the risk of becoming rapidly drops .
smo@@ kers have a far increased risk to lose their teeth early .
this is out of the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several co @-@ workers at the German Institute of Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
in comparison to non @-@ smoking cigarettes the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely , in order to lose the 2.5 @-@ 3.6 feet .
the scientists observed more than 23.@@ 300 participants .
main causes for dental loss are c@@ aries and inflamm@@ ations of the g@@ um , emphas@@ izes the DI@@ f@@ E .
in smoking , smoking is a risk factor for those peri@@ od@@ ont@@ itis .
the connection between smoking and dental loss can therefore go back to frequent g@@ ums in smo@@ kers .
not to clari@@ fy whether smoking increases the risk of c@@ aries .
people who list@@ ened to smoking by smoking could reduce their risk in short time , but researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
however , it could take over ten years until the haz@@ ards return to the non @-@ smoking level , the aut@@ or Thomas Dietrich von der English University Birmingham .
one must convince humans to be able to no smoking , the study manager H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking cuts the life time . &quot;
not to smoke is good for lungs and j@@ ars and leads to good teeth as well as to the high age .
in Germany , over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years are affected from tooth @-@ hood , the DI@@ f@@ E distributed .
previous studies had been pointed out that smoking is the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ pin the findings .

EU Commission attacks in dispute over TT@@ IP new court
the EU Commission proposed a comprehensive reform of the current bit@@ ration system , which has the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement for TT@@ IP .
the controversi@@ al private donation facilities for disp@@ utes between the corpor@@ ations and the states must be super@@ se@@ ded by a transparent system which corresponds to considerably more traditional dishes in its operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to do a system that trust the citizens &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; declared the member of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU Com@@ miss@@ arin Cec@@ ilia &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Swe@@ din has presented the proposal as a European negoti@@ ating position in the Free Trade talks with the USA .
the German Government announced support of it .
TT@@ IP should become the largest Free Trade Area of the World with 800 million people .
plans to reform current arbit@@ ration procedure will show specifically that the EU states and the U.S. will select an independent judges for the new investment program .
you should come from the EU , the United States and third countries .
the first instance will also be a second instance for the first time .
it would allow it to collect against ur@@ ine ad@@ dic@@ ts .
so far , the process involved among themselves was agreed upon refer@@ ee , there was not an exp@@ iring to their sentences .
in the discussion of recent months it was clear that citizens were not familiar with the old IS@@ DS system in terms of fair@@ ness and justice .
in the long term , it intends to present their own data to an international investment court .
then , for example , disp@@ utes between Chinese companies and EU states may also be clari@@ fied .
the Invest@@ or @-@ Sta@@ ats @-@ State arbit@@ ration procedure ( IS@@ DS ) , above all , apply as one of the major reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TT@@ IP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration boards become critical of opponents as a way of parallel , increasing the companies , ass@@ essing the tax exemp@@ tions , national legislation or setting a decrease of consumer and environmental standards .
in the first comments , anti @-@ TT@@ IP organizations such as Camp@@ act were submitted to the European Commission as in@@ sufficient .

rum@@ our arises , &quot; Michigan &quot; would be the first part of a we@@ ar@@ able series : each of the 50 U.S. states that should be discussed in a row .
but already in 2004 and in the Rhine , already &quot; seven Sw@@ ans &quot; had already been published and there were very positive expectations .

Jeremy Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s debut in the prime minister of the Prime Minister
Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s has been tent@@ atively expected to attend the Prime Minister &apos;s office since his election .
the new Labour MEP Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n will give his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s office and to David Cameron &apos;s first time for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to provide the first of his six given questions shortly after mid@@ day , with his performance of the media probably and the Labour MEP in the vicinity .
he called &quot; less theat@@ res and more facts &quot; during this weekly event .
he also said that he could ski@@ p some meetings to transfer her colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s leadership , since it comes to his appointment as a member of the Sch@@ atten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the ruling of the Labour Chairman , on Tuesday during the singing of the National An@@ them at a commemorative ceremony on the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , critic@@ ises the criticism of a number of ory @-@ MP@@ S and is in the focus of several title pages @-@ stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s decision , not the National An@@ them to sing , raised attention to itself
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ person by Mr Cor@@ b@@ old said he had got drunk &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in resp@@ ect@@ ful silent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he was recognized the hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the air battle around England &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s Sch@@ atten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night programme , he did not come to Labour &apos;s chairman , to sing the National An@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his faith that the monarchy should be abolished .
almost a dozen of shade @-@ ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s top team and they are called on differences in economy , defense and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Parliamentary Party supported him as guide .
the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also pil@@ ed within &quot; Labour &quot; and to Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation at profits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour changes in order to remove the whole idea of a limit in total .
hours later Mr Smith , the Shadow of the labor and pen@@ al ministers , said that the party is very clear that only against the government plans , the limit was £ 26@@ ,000 to £ 23@@ ,000 .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader , which David Cameron descended on the T@@ ent Assembly , over the last decade following the Dis@@ patch box , over the last decade .
the Labour leader , promised to another policy of policy , says that he has given &quot; C@@ row@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr. Cameron and given more than 30.000 suggestions .
Is@@ lington North MP has said that the round of the Prime Minister is con@@ front@@ ally , and that he under@@ takes both &quot; demol@@ ition &quot; and the battle with resist@@ ors and to concentr@@ ating on serious problems like poverty , ine@@ quality and challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , who will not participate in the shade @-@ minist@@ ries , will not participate if he is not part - for example , if Mr Cameron is traveling abroad .
he also brought the idea to talks that other colleagues are likely to take the word , and that he spoke John Ber@@ lic@@ as spokes@@ man of the sub@@ sid@@ y , to discuss the problem .
when he was leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he was able to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; cas@@ per@@ le theatre , &quot; who is often linked to the Prime Minister &apos;s bud@@ gets . but a few years later he was that he failed to fail .
since it was first sent to television in 1990 , the Group was considered to be a major Bar@@ ometer by the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the sub@@ house and his position among his parliamentary election , even the critics argu@@ ed that they had become a car@@ ic@@ ature and need considerable re@@ forms .

metal cash launches ground @-@ loss campaign campaign to fight Al@@ di@@ - In@@ fall
it is trying to protect the IG@@ A branch off to a Al@@ di mar@@ que in South Australia and Western Australia .
food @-@ whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers Met@@ ering has launched a ground mis@@ sal campaign to defend the market share of IG@@ A retailers in South Australia and Western Australia to defend a $ 700 million Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepared the opening of two sales centres and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia in the beginning of next year , Met@@ cash and IG@@ A supermarkets have prepared their relationships with local food suppliers and build the brand &apos;s IG@@ A through Main@@ stream marketing and marketing through the social media , as well as events like Adelaide Show .
IG@@ A De@@ aler and suppliers jump aboard , featuring brands such as ash manufacturer Simm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , distributed in IG@@ A @-@ stores samples and shop @-@ owner , which sell cheap tickets for the South Australian football League at lo@@ yal customers .
it is expected that a further details of his defense strategy will be released on September 29 , when the whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers of food , alcohol and devices will go through its annual Invest@@ ors &apos; strategy date .
it is much on the game , as South Australia and Western Australia , nearly 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A shop@@ pers are making up and higher profit mar@@ gins of as Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A network in Eastern states .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ fic province and IG@@ A retailers have a much stronger market share in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia as compared to about 14 percent in Eastern states .
however , an@@ alysts do feel such as Morgan Stanley that Al@@ di &apos;s twelve months will take you away from the food market in these two states and to take almost all existing actors , but mainly independent retailers can take away .
a report published in this week , analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath from Morgan Stanley published that IG@@ A single retail@@ er could lose 360 million turnover each year and will lose $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this progn@@ osis is based on the assum@@ ption that Al@@ di is opened in the next year 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA , generating revenue of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in the food and grocery market and the quantities at Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed base may cost Met@@ ering around $ 13 million in profit before interest and tax , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , the cash @-@ cash share was lost in eastern states , mainly to Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recently conducted survey carried out by Roy Morgan had found that IG@@ A purchases must be the faithful .
Morgan Stanley is expanding that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s turnover in the Food and grocery store is 3.8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and a market share of 14 percent in 2015 will be reduced to 10.3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , at a business dinner in Melbourne , that metal will probably be able to disappear within a decade .
Met@@ cash refused it to react on the comments by Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash has been in contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
IG@@ As market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and income from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Food and Food trade , which has been around 1,200 percent since 2012 , reflects the reduction of operating debt reduction on sales and mar@@ gins since 2012 .
the whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers will refin@@ ements , however , investing more than $ 150 million to carry out sales prices of hundreds of products per week with hundreds of products and IG@@ A retailers in improving their stores due to faster increasing food products and to provide a better choice of private Label F@@ oods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s main managing director Ian Mor@@ at@@ rice says that the price @-@ adaptation and char@@ gin programmes on elan offer and hopes that the whol@@ ef@@ al@@ ers will return to a profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years .
Than@@ asi Co@@ kin@@ is is supported by the president of the Australian tennis series Steve He@@ aly
than@@ asi Co@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserv@@ es praise as a cr@@ iti@@ que for his behaviour .
Tan@@ asi Co@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ateral Damage &quot; in the shorter storm around his friend Nick K@@ yr@@ gios and des@@ erve the view of the President of the Australian tennis court Steve He@@ aly rather praise to criticism for his own behaviour .
co@@ ca@@ kin@@ is , the younger of talented Du@@ os , is always referred to as the &quot; Special KS &quot; by the not@@ orious of K@@ yr@@ gios with St@@ an WA@@ W@@ R@@ IN@@ KA at the Montreal Masters at Ram@@ p .
in a lake qualification game in Cinc@@ inn@@ ati in soon afterwards , coconut oil and his opponent Ry@@ an Har@@ rison had to be separated by the refer@@ ee , Har@@ rison had to hit K@@ yr@@ gios , and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was last seen , as he defeated a tennis ra@@ cket , after a cr@@ amp@@ f had a potential U.S. Open winning of Richard Gas@@ quet , co@@ ca@@ ine was def@@ ended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , in competition with Sam Gr@@ oth in the second place in singles on the Davis Cup finals in the Davis Cup finals against Great Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing about whom I am fairly je@@ al@@ ous , is the fact that after my view Than@@ asi was a little in the dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he broke out a bat as he lost a bat in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has cr@@ ushed a bat of fru@@ stration among themselves , and I know Than@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of them .
but , really , he has extremely well worked in the US Open , even under the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on and I think he deserv@@ ed much recognition .
he got a great team around it , he has a great family around , and I think he was a little about strictly treated .
he is a very rei@@ vious 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard and he has never been involved with other players , he is trained in the locker area , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserv@@ es it to be assessed according to its own services .
He@@ aly did not support the decision to take the K@@ yr@@ gios in the important preliminary decision that begins on Friday and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right for all but it backs up the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term fixed part of the team . &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team is completely concentrated on the competition and not all the contro@@ vers@@ y around &#91; K@@ yr@@ gios &#93; , &quot; said He@@ aly .
and I believe that Nick has made a way to advance the asc@@ ension to what he gets like pen and Mur@@ ray . he gets in the sight of the audience , but we try to think it understand the consequences of his work . some time out of the ramp , I think it is reasonable , and it &apos;s best for the crew and it &apos;s the best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary explains emergency welfare , closes the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary explains the emergency @-@ war and locked the south border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all the firm trying to come illeg@@ ally into the country . everything with the goal to stop the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed at the border , when hundreds of migrants were dealing with indig@@ nation in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land who responded by indig@@ nation .
the people fled from violence , st@@ aked for an unknown time in a landing stre@@ ak on the street between the two control points of the states , and built tents and settled there .
but fru@@ str@@ ations climbed .
when a police helicopter is floating on them , the migrants &quot; Open the border ! &quot; and cried al@@ ps against the Hungarian ad@@ mon@@ ary police force .
some referred from protest to food and water .
Serbia &apos;s Foreign Affairs declared that it was &quot; un@@ acceptable &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be able to come back from Hungary , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece .
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not to be a coll@@ ateral .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will take place in the coming days &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; talks with Brussels and other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Iv@@ ica D@@ ac@@ ic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tur@@ bul@@ ences at Hungarian @-@ Serbian border reached a single day after the 28 @-@ Nations @-@ block at a str@@ ingent meeting in Brussels .
however , the ministers agreed to divide the responsibility for 40,000 people who would seek refuge in the over@@ flow@@ ed Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that - the next month or until the end of the year - an agreement would result in such a further 120,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
on Tuesday , German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on Tuesday a special summit in the European Union to discuss the migration crisis in the continent .
however , Hungary continued its hopes for an early action in Brussels or of its neigh@@ bors .
the emergency staff was delivered on Tuesday in two southern regions contributed more powers to the crisis in the crisis , so that they could cut streets and accelerate asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ ar@@ to said that his country has also plan to build a bar@@ bed wire along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after it has ended a fence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News Cor@@ respon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even jail @-@ masses were used at the race , the bar@@ bed wire sp@@ ell between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months , Hungary is for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East , an enormous bott@@ len@@ eck and for the entrance to the European Union .
Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban passed , however , that most of the coming economic refugees are in search of a better life , and non @-@ war refugees who are strong in contra@@ diction to other EU countries , including Germany .
the new laws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or dam@@ aging the 4 @-@ metre ( 13 ft ) tall gate to cultiv@@ ate the government along the southern border with Serbia , to a crime . these laws also put higher adher@@ es to the tra@@ ff@@ ic@@ kers .
&quot; because of the situation created by the mass migration , the Hungarian government declared the emergency state , &quot; said doctors Z@@ olt@@ an K@@ ov@@ acs , journalists in the southern city of Sz@@ eged .
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must still agree to the military operation , which is expected for next week , but repor@@ ters from Associated Press have seen on the border heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country Security Council for Or@@ ban , said that authorities 45 people in attempt to cross the border , 15 others were down deeper into the country .
they come over by being damaged the fence , they are now in police custody and become charged with off@@ ences after the new law .
the authorities are preparing to repair the fence .
in Tuesday morning there were two of the seven border lines with Serbia , after an tractor with bar@@ bed wire , to close the borders .
chaos re@@ painted the main border crossing close to Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and pressed a crowd of people around it .
around 20 patients were able to get involved , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the main highway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would be refused to travel food and water until they travel to Hungary .
election 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s advantage of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in a national survey
former US State Hill@@ ary Clinton continues to keep a double @-@ digit advantage in the democratic race around the nom@@ ination at national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her towards the ground .
Clinton has now supporting 47 percent of the democratic voters during the pre @-@ elections ( 58 percent earlier ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( rise by 17 percent ) .
Vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not been announced whether he is appointed by the presidential office , receives support of 15 percent of the Democratic voters .
more than five months prior to the beginning of the pres@@ election , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinions is fixed , which candidates will support them .
but Clinton &apos;s Clinton &apos;s supporters are more resistant than that of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS @-@ News survey , Clinton has lost a number of demo@@ graphic performances , while S@@ anders had achieved some profits .
Clinton holds a major advantage in women and moder@@ ation , but these pre@@ aches have decreased .
their support for the male has fallen significantly , and S@@ anders is only with 5 points .
Clin@@ t &apos;s advantage in democratic voters under 50 years of age has been vol@@ at@@ ile , and them and S@@ anders are now at equal height .
however Clinton has yet a big lead in the older voters .
in the past month , Clinton was before S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit margin of the Liber@@ als but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point @-@ lead to this group .
about half of the democratic voters of the parliamentary elections should say that they would support with enthusiasm , if it was nominated by the party .
a quarter would support them with some of the gu@@ ards and another 15 percent would only support them because they are the candidate .
they would not support six percent .
maybe not surprising that Clin@@ t &apos;s current supporters are especially thr@@ illed by their .
the views are stronger on those who currently do not support Clinton - only about one quarter would thr@@ illed them .
while 48 percent of the democratic voters say that Clinton can support Clinton with enthusiasm , say less republi@@ can voters about their peak counter Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
when Clin@@ t &apos;s Clin@@ t supports in an open question , the most common answer is that it has the correct experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view it is time that a woman has been a woman ( 13 per cent ) and that it is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
from Clin@@ t suppor@@ ter the association is also mentioned by Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
consent to the problems and elig@@ i@@ bility are also quoted .
since the vice president th@@ rows a potential for the presidential office in the orph@@ ans , 57 % of the voters want to see him in the race - although one @-@ third believes that it should not do it .
if democratic voters will be asked by the elec@@ tor , who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den at the top .
from Clinton &apos;s tra@@ ilers say more than half that Bi@@ den would have their second choice far off S@@ anders .
Bi@@ den , not for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , the Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s Clinton increases the lead before S@@ anders , from 20 points with bi@@ ds in the race to 30 points without him in the race .
five @-@ five percent of the elec@@ torate considers Clinton as candidate with the best chances to win the choice ; however , this figure has decreased by 78 per cent over the last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ den has a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees him as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; selectable &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , in question after@@ ward , what is more important at a Candi@@ date , Democratic Elec@@ tor Question about voters .
similarly as in the last month , no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for this elec@@ tor are declared un@@ acceptable .
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates produce good results with some important characteristics during the elec@@ torate of their party .
maj@@ orities consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Be@@ den as hon@@ est and tru@@ st@@ worthy and with strong guidance .
with the three candidates , Bi@@ den is best starting with hon@@ esty , while Clin@@ t &apos;s population is the strength of the world .
thirty per cent of the democratic voters don &apos;t believe that Clinton &apos;s hon@@ est and trusted , twice as many say that of S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion about him .
Democratic Elec@@ tor of the Pre@@ sel@@ ections show general Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ ds ide@@ ology in accordance with their views .
with all these measurements , about one quarter of the democratic voters were no opinion of S@@ anders .
since questions about Hill@@ ary Clinton uses a personal e @-@ mail address and a server in office as an Foreign Minister , most of the Democratic voters are happy with their explanation of the matter and say that it does not distur@@ b their opinions .
but it is a different story in the American public .
half of the Americans now are dis@@ satisfied with their statement , whereas only one third is happy .
the public opinion about this was in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans say that the e @-@ mail contro@@ vers@@ y had no impact on their general opinions of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion was not deterior@@ ated .
there are mainly Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say that their views were worse than Clinton .
although Clinton used to be hon@@ est and tru@@ st@@ worthy from the voters , this continues to be a problem for them under a registered voters . only 32 percent see they be hon@@ est and trusted , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of all eligible places do not hold them for a hon@@ est and tru@@ st@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 per cent of the voters must be regarded as hon@@ est@@ ly and not tru@@ st@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , preserved good notes .
of the six tested candidates Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush wanted best in honor .
a majority looks rather to be hon@@ est than hon@@ est , but as with Car@@ son many do not have any opinion about him .
the error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic voters at the pre @-@ elections is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son resi@@ t at the national survey close behind Donald Tr@@ ump on
Ben Car@@ son is a recent survey conducted by C@@ BS News / New York Times , behind Donald Tr@@ ump
the two candidates have meanwhile fallen from the support of voters in the new survey , and others lose dramatically .
Republi@@ can voters still support Tr@@ ump in large numbers . support grows by 23 % over the last C@@ BS @-@ survey carried out on Fox News debate in the past month , by 27 % in the survey on Tuesday .
but Car@@ son shot a 6 % drop in the same period to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son encoun@@ ters at demo@@ graphic groups and sur@@ pass Tr@@ ump in Republi@@ can elec@@ torate with university education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio @-@ governor of John Kas@@ per , is defeated by Wis@@ con@@ sins and Scott Walker , who has fallen below the deep@@ est , namely 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
the former Florida Govern@@ or J@@ eb Bush , the former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ sas , Mike Hu@@ ck@@ y@@ e and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio are at 6 % on the third place .
the error margin in the sample of 376 persons from Rep@@ ublic@@ s voters in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , which was published last week shows that Car@@ son increases in poll@@ s - it accounts with 19 % support for rep@@ ublic@@ ans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the latest survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed tr@@ ump clearly before Car@@ son .
at a glance at one in the last week increasing Car@@ son , Tr@@ ump found some side hi@@ es for the former neuro@@ sur@@ geon , even after Car@@ son compl@@ ained about to ask tr@@ um@@ ps faith into question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump last Saturday during a campaign in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot;

five members of the Brotherhood died with the death of a Baruch College new@@ com@@ ings
nearly two years after a student at Po@@ con@@ o Mountains in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , passed away , M@@ ord@@ acc@@ compl@@ ain are filed against five .
members of the New York Baruch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood captured Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during a Ein@@ führungs@@ rit@@ u@@ als , in September 2013 , and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death .
officials said that he had been stressed with connected eyes with a 30 pound back@@ pack of sand , and repeatedly attacked , while attemp@@ ting to al@@ locate a frozen field to a goal .
Mr. Den@@ g mour@@ ned over head aches , then he dropped un@@ conscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si bro@@ therhood shou@@ ldn &apos;t call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g began and waited another hour before they brought him into a hospital , thus the police .
however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing to contact his symptoms and Andy Men@@ g , to contact the national president of the Brotherhood to catch advice , said pol@@ ishing ef Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; at this point the members of the U@@ ten@@ sil@@ ia started to hide and when the Brotherhood was in principle talking about Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said pol@@ ishing ef Wagner .
he could not re@@ vit@@ alize , and he died next morning to his injuries .
however after a aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g repeatedly has been done with a dum@@ b force on the head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many families were destroyed by the cru@@ is@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least a student dies since 1970 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , who tre@@ ats his family in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
bro@@ th@@ erh@@ oods and their members need to be taken to account , and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Monroe Rec@@ ferred on charges of murder of five members for the first five members .
two and thirty members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with p@@ ic attacks and formation of a criminal organization .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not only want to make the involved parties , but if there is an organization that - officially or un@@ officially - this , we will also apply these to account , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Baruch College had forbidden the Brotherhood , and the national bro@@ therhood can di@@ lap@@ id@@ st its affili@@ ation .
this will happen if the F@@ ed raised its interest
a return rate is coming , and the domestic use will come into a stri@@ ve , yields to bonds , and the economy will lead into recession .
we know that .
what we don &apos;t know how long this will take and how long it will stop .
the story of the economy only offers low guidance for the economy only .
a recession occurred within just 11 months after the first interest rate of interest and lasted for 86 months .
the aggressi@@ vity of the Federal Reserve at the lifting of interest rates is often , even though it is not always a factor of how the economy and financial assets react .
hence , representative of the US Central Bank thus under@@ stands that investors are not concentrated on it when it begins to increase the interest rates , but rather on the period that is needed for norm@@ alization .
in fact , several variables are playing a role .
at the end , market participants could determine that all the exc@@ itement is possibly ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated because of a interest increase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cheaper terrain &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Julian J@@ ess@@ op , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a Communication to customer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradu@@ al return of US interest to normal heights , but still at low level to show the seism@@ ic shock to lead many too .
however , this does not mean that there will be no effect .
here &apos;s a current trends , based on how some areas of the economy could react :
as the market has seen in the last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest rate accounts can be more vol@@ at@@ ati@@ l for a while .
once the increase arrives , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; there is apparently a tendency that wealth deals shall be re@@ compens@@ ated for 12 to 24 months after the first increase in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank an@@ alysts &quot; said in a recent study , according to what happened at F@@ ed .
more precisely , the market is usually in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to interest increase , fairly flat in the 250 days after it ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , with an average return in the past six last cycles of 14.4 percent according to a current analysis , the Bob D@@ oll , chief facility Strat@@ Us at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , with Bar@@ ron &apos;s pro .
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tend to occur later in the Incre@@ ased cycle and the return of the shares begin to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest rate increases often .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is con@@ fron@@ ted with some terms that could not make it before and to speed up the recession .
it is extremely interesting that the gross domestic product is close to its lowest point at a point increase of F@@ ed .
according to the Deutsche Bank , 118 interest rate increases in 1950 only twice the nominal GDP of less than 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 was at 3.6 percent , we expect that this will take effect and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter following the Atlanta .
interest rate in a frag@@ ile economic situation could be ris@@ ky and throw up the question , &quot; whether it &apos;s different , &quot; said Deutsche Bank .
market participants have made all the year on an interest rate of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in this week that ends on Thursday .
while many strateg@@ ists believe and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC may show a rise in this session , the fut@@ ures trade show a chance of 25 per cent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all enh@@ ances cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a Super cycle with increasing the GDP in the GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ ite heights very quickly after the beginning of the recovery , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by contrast , this is definitely a slow recreation of what the worst recession in the observed phase was .
the current cycle is by far the longest , which the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months .
it was also vol@@ ati@@ l , since the market increases the interest rate , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect on bonds can be faster than in stock when changing their strategic course .
with bonds , the yields seem to change the direction as soon as the first increase in the cycle is eff@@ ected .
at the end of the exchange cycle , the German Bank said immediately , the Deutsche Bank said .
the strategies of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase in interest rates will lead that yields between longer and shorter bonds can lead to a deep@@ ening of the curve .
high @-@ interest bonds often bring better yields , even though &quot; we are careful to expect higher yields , Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come @-@ An@@ alysts &quot; in Schw@@ ab , in an analysis .
the market is what Jones , that the markets are already adjusted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline of the inflation , there are some signs that the market has adapted to the outlook on stric@@ ter monetary policy , &quot; she wrote .
short @-@ term interest have risen , the applic@@ ant is flat , lending activities have increased and the Vol@@ at@@ il@@ ity has risen - all features of the market if the F@@ ed tigh@@ tened its strategy .
in the large and whole range , businesses , which are able to pile the larger part of their business activities in the USA , benef@@ iting from interest rates , and local products are more attractive .
multin@@ ational corpor@@ ations with high debts are worse due , as a rising dollar is more expensive on the global market and as well as financing of their debts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to respond well three months after an initial interest increase , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Gold@@ man Sachs @-@ An@@ alysts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said in a report to the customer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
firms with strong balance , companies have exceeded overall sales by 5 percentage points after each of the figures in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital yields , as well as low volume sever@@ ity in their shares , also exceeded its counter@@ parts with low quality at an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts become a big problem .
businesses with a high share of flexible interest will lose most , Gold@@ man said .
out of pure stock markets , consumers are also benef@@ iting by increasing poverty .
as@@ par@@ agus could see gains due to higher yields , even if there are experts in different opinion , how fast that will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says Parliament member Andrew B@@ ingham
the conservative member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the transmitter for his &quot; stup@@ id &quot;
he argu@@ ed that he is not to distingu@@ ish increasingly from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also directed the BBC Music Awards , saying that they just cited The Br@@ its
the Parliament colleagues Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins attacked The Voice Message and said that this is not the original .
BBC Radio 3 &quot; turns into Classic FM , &quot; says a leader member of the parliament and increases new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does not do something that does not do the private .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the conservative MEP Andrew B@@ ingham has also said to the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; that the public @-@ legal radio station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stup@@ id &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly can be distinguished by its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t use the word &quot; stup@@ id &quot; but it seems to transform itself into Classic FM , &quot; he said .
he has also directed the BBC Music Awards , which began in December at the end of December .
the BBC Music Awards , which began last year , seem to be the Br@@ its just under another name .
so , if you try to do something different - these are two spont@@ ane@@ ously mentioned examples , in which you are actually only the im@@ it@@ ating what is already on the market , &quot; says Mr B@@ ingham .
BBC @-@ General@@ maj@@ esty rejected the acc@@ us@@ ations and argu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 starts a lot from his commercial competitors , when it comes to live music and en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment .
what I &apos;m going to learn by Radio 3 , I will learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music which is really not sur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and giving new works in order , I also think so important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey , that har@@ der has been working to eng@@ age the audience , when it did this in the past , because the British had been informed about classical music .
radio 3 , however , was not the only element of the BBC output , which during the hearing in the Committee on the selection of culture , media and sport for it to rest@@ rain commercial ri@@ vals on their feet .
the T@@ ory pu@@ ties Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins attacked The Voice to - the musical talent show of the BBC , which was bought by the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed , because it is not originally original and not particularly striking ?
LORD Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show was produced on behalf of Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as the Richter - &quot; in particular BBC mode . &quot;
he added that he wants to find the company &quot; a hit from our own barn , &quot; if it is the next time a entertainment series are star@@ ved .
however , he refused to exclu@@ de the order from another series of The Voice in the Future or give money of the tax@@ pay@@ ers for other entertainment formats .
Internet revenue rose in August on the slow@@ est and the black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month , there was the lowest result since the record recorded in 2000 .
online sales intensi@@ fied three years ago through the use of cell phones
experts believe that Black Friday has ott@@ est in November
for over a decade , the virtual shopping opportunities were drilled , and many of the main shopping streets in the UK have turned into gh@@ ost .
but experts say that it now counts , that online sales were stag@@ n@@ ating , after new numbers showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure on August presented the lowest increase in growth since the start of records in 2000 with just five percent increase from the previous year .
experts say that there are evidence that online sales are stag@@ n@@ ating , after new numbers show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you consider the growth rates for the previous years and then rec@@ alled until 2000 , during the time it has always been developed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ RG sales index &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he explained that the online sales was 3 years ago intensi@@ fied as a buyer , to make purchases on their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now the one comm@@ utes itself and we will probably experience that the growth is reduced .
the black @-@ Friday phenomenon , which was imported from America , is cited as a reason for the post@@ ing revenues .
experts believe that buyers will hold its purchases during this event , which will take place last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers got their computers to make their bar@@ gain , and some dealer websites cut off .
experts believe that Black Friday , in which the buyer could take against bar@@ gains , buyers of which could still be able to make purchases .
a study by the British Ret@@ ail Con@@ sortium found that out of £ 5 spending more than 1 £ online was issued .
in some products such as TV and washing machines there are more than one @-@ third of all purchases on web @-@ shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of people bought clothes and shoes online rather than in the mo@@ dec@@ ins of the inner city .
Muslims who died in Mec@@ ca at the crane accident of the accident - Bin Lad@@ der family will be rehabil@@ it@@ ated
the dead bodies of 29 dead are Muslims in the first attempt in Mec@@ ca by the streets
Saudi Arabia puts the collapse in part of the immense Saudi Bin Laden team to the burden of Saudi Arabia .
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed
hundreds of Muslims gathered themselves when 29 of the victims were borne by the streets to bury them that were killed when a crane collap@@ sed on Mec@@ ca &apos;s wholesale oint@@ ment .
sad@@ ly filled , mostly in white , the distance to declare their respect when the first of the dead came to the Al @-@ Mo@@ a@@ isse@@ m cemetery .
the tragedy must pass on the holy place where only days before a building crane through the ceiling of the mosque , and then on the bed collap@@ sed .
the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for the fun@@ eral when the Saudi King above the building company Bin Laden , because of the cat@@ astrophe , which left the last 3@@ 94 injured , a san@@ ction was hanging .
the dead bodies of 29 firms who were killed when a crane collap@@ sed by the Great Central Po@@ en@@ ee Mec@@ ca , were carried through the streets .
on the dead , Q@@ as@@ im Ak@@ ram was from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who fell on his first pilgrimage to the crane .
Mr Ak@@ ram was in front of his parents in the great mosque in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials have already promised that H@@ add@@ ling to Mec@@ ca with thousands of those who continue to come to the city will continue .
in 1989 , King Sal@@ man , the Bin Laden Group would not have stopped supporting the arm of the crane as he was not used .
a Arabian version of the decree issued by the state Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin Laden Group is responsible for the collapse .
the English @-@ language service of the news agency reported that detail , however , said that the company &apos;s leadership will travel abroad .
in the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man fell to reveal what the fall of the crane collap@@ sed , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims in front of the H@@ add@@ sch takes place this month , gathered at this month .
the Bin Laden group had no statements about the collapse of the crane , and their representatives were not available for an opinion .
the Royal Decree also did not address the group because of un@@ current security measures , because they did not co@@ operate with meteor@@ ologist .
dozens of Kr@@ ans in Mec@@ ca is surrounded by Mec@@ ca &apos;s big town as part of the massive building project , which is led by the Bin Laden Group .
the Bin Laden family has been linked to the Saudi Arabia by Saudi Arabia and assumes larger construction projects .
the de@@ ceased leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a revol@@ ting son who was disp@@ oss@@ essed from the family in the 1990s .
the crash of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain , only a few days before arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage that is at least once in the life of any healthy body .
officials said that 158 people remain in hospital .
government officials announced that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) are victims of relatives and are the same amount of permanent injured .
others retain half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Boss says that the time of the cheapest European Cra@@ fts@@ men is over
Brit@@ ons increasingly employ tra@@ des@@ men , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of qualified crafts@@ men from Eastern Europe has rising behind
this leads to a further 200 bug@@ fix shops , which aims to aim at the tra@@ des@@ men &apos;s targets .
simultaneously , King@@ F@@ isher 60 B &amp; Q sales represent nationwide .
by Ru@@ pert Steiner , the City Head @-@ Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it claims that British will perform their hamm@@ ers and brush in favour of the use by qualified workers who perform works in their home .
when you &apos;re skilled with a hammer or a brush for decor@@ ating walls , it is now one of a minority in today .
for British , however , Britain increasingly employ tra@@ des@@ people to perform DIY jobs in their houses , the head of the company behind B &amp; Q .
V@@ é@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new Managing Director of King@@ F@@ isher , who owns the construction sector , said that a large increase in the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe , offering services to corporate prices have been overhau@@ led .
therefore the King@@ F@@ isher , 200 further Scre@@ w@@ fix Shops is planning to open understanding of professionals and put 60 sales outlets from B &amp; Q .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said that they would employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten buying decisions in the store are taken by women .
at the moment the men weigh the men .
she said it is necessary to make the growing demo@@ graphic trends that have more significant single @-@ households that will make more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; there is still a majority of men in our branch office .
we need to move it stronger to balance .
basically , half of our clients are made up of women with 80 percent of the decisions concerning the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in a decisive process .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the head of a British in the F@@ T@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also reflects her top team to reflect the same number of men and women in executive positions .
King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only enterprise that has occupied exactly 50 per cent of the team with women , including its management and Chief Financial Officer .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was an conscious choice - diversity is an important topic here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ F@@ isher launched a decline in half @-@ year gain and the modifications , after the Group contra@@ cted the cost of closing the shops .
because of the trends , King@@ F@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q is opened to open 200 new branches .
function of A@@ I / DO@@ B because of un@@ faith@@ fulness in court
the Provin@@ cial Court of Klagenfurt have met two officials of the Austrian volleyball @-@ runner @-@ up of A@@ I / DO@@ B for ev@@ asion and conditions .
the accused pleaded not guilty .
one of them was also charged for abuse of authority .
in May 2008 , it was acquitted by this alleg@@ ation .
the current process was post@@ pon@@ ed .
according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General Robert Ri@@ ffel had emerged in the preliminary investigation that the accused were disp@@ ers@@ ed in the years 2006 to 2011 that disp@@ ose of them disp@@ ose of their functions for private purposes .
the damage caused the damage to some 400,000 Euros .
the sports functional are also charged because of financial inten@@ tions .
this fact was divided into the chairman of the open @-@ board , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be negoti@@ ated at a later date .
the defence counsel that the association was in force in no time a possession for the dis@@ solution of the un@@ faith@@ fulness .
the sports functional would only have been pri@@ mand@@ ed and made the sports club , for whom they had worked from 1982 to 2011 and had been invested in the debt of the debt - the Passi@@ va had approximately 600.000 Sch@@ ill@@ ings in 2001 ( about 44@@ .000 Euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then we stood before the situation : do we lead the club on or un@@ lock ? , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; told one of the accused , in the bread prof@@ essor@@ ship of the financial year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ endants , he decided to take this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have poured out money , our life insurance policies as security at the Bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in assignment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association has been agreed with the association : you can freely manage the money , there are only no debts to be made .
furthermore , with the respective financial resources , the payout of the allowance was agreed upon by 1991 .
therefore , as an increase on the account , you have been paid off from the year 2003 , as an increase on the account has been paid out .
therefore , the l@@ ump and not detailed bookings are shown , the former Ob@@ mann explained its operations .
the accounts and savings of both the accused were co @-@ administered jointly , and the second one def@@ endants .
why the withdraw@@ als to the association were not explained in detail , the judge asked .
the association was not interested in the financing of financial investments which was important only to freedom of debt , so the response .
when investig@@ ating a func@@ tionary investigations because of the authorities in 2011 , an amount of 120,000 EUR was transferred to the club account .
these were the set@@ backs , declared the accused .
this value of securities went on the name of the second def@@ endants , and was not known according to the association .
&quot; why ? , &quot; I wanted to know the judge .

time of decision on interest rates for U.S. exp@@ o
the world is watching if the U.S. music bank is on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , together to make the important decision whether or for the first time since almost a decade will be raised or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists that were surveyed by Reuters , found that a little more than half , the F@@ ed will do this , now think that the F@@ ed will continue to keep a little longer and interest rates on this current state of 0 @-@ 0.25 percent .
it &apos;s a historic event because it is seven years ago since the F@@ ed Inter@@ est was seated on NU@@ LL .
for the first time we approach one of the situation in which a large central bank is leaving the zero field and a process of norm@@ alization of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , Head staff at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the US economy is on a relatively good performance , trillion dollars are added to the balance and generate just a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ro@@ w@@ ed outlook on global conditions .
the markets war@@ ns against an increase in the markets , but the signs indicate that the opportunities are well against such a step .
the decision should be announced at 20.00 CET on Thursday
note of death at the Delta State University , sending def@@ amation claims
after the shooting and killing of his gir@@ l@@ friend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he shot his colleague , he wrote that &quot; sorry , &quot; on the first murder , and wanted to say , &quot; he could do so to happen , &quot; stated authorities on Tuesday .
the police in G@@ auti@@ er , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , teacher for Ge@@ ography and Social Sciences at the Delta State University , calling the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning
and he said , He has shot on someone , and killed someone .
he refers to the staff of the emergency call that police officers to send police officers to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house but nobody becomes anno@@ ying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but probably more excited . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police in@@ quired after his name , but he did not give him .
there were no explanation for his shots .
when police seized the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ ent@@ iss , 41 , and a handwritten note from Lamb , 45 , and a handwritten note : &quot; I am sorry , I wanted to do it back .
I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
after writing a letter from more than 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor for history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen came to destroy him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ for@@ ge said that he did not know anything from a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday , from the Lamb that he had a relationship with Schmidt , the authorities said on Tuesday , there was no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ ent@@ iss has been married by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said that she had been married for about seven years when a &quot; good &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was described &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were di@@ vor@@ ced 15 years ago , but they remained friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said that he and he had a daughter who was 19 , and she was destroyed &quot; at the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ ent@@ iss have had her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
Pr@@ un@@ iss worked online from home , according to Lin@@ s@@ day Know@@ les , which was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ un@@ iss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ ab@@ iss , who possessed a dog named Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help others , &quot; said Know@@ les
the police said , refer to a certain point on Monday to say to them , &quot; he will not go into prison . &quot;
when police officer visited him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville in that night they drove his car to the side , fled on foot , ran in the forest and killed himself with a shot .
he received a PhD in spring 2015 from Delta State University like a PhD based on the university &apos;s website .

the Bank &apos;s goal is to achieve a profit contribution of some 500 million euros a year from cost and revenues , the airline distributed on Wednesday .
among other things , there is no board for the passenger business in the future .
the low cost line Eu@@ ros@@ ings should be as independent as possible .

hat@@ ch@@ able Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United can &apos;t play char@@ m@@ ang for double fra@@ cture
in the Champions League , Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double fra@@ cture of its right bi@@ one at the Champions League defeat in Manchester .
while this left the left of the left for weeping and to close it for at least six months , Louis van G@@ aal en@@ closes the hope that Sha@@ w can play again this season .
the injury was caused by a back@@ ing attack by H@@ é@@ connector Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute , after which the 20 year old Sha@@ w was broken in the PS@@ V region .
he was treated nine minutes on the field and required oxygen before being put into the hospital .
van G@@ aal said : &quot; he has twice a leg , and is in hospital . &quot;
it will be moved tomorrow or perhaps one day later , and then in Manchester had surgery .
it is aw@@ ful - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United has really hard and then really play it and then happening .
in the dressing cabin he had a oxygen mask .
he wept .
I am not a doctor but if you have a double fra@@ cture , then it takes 6 months , and it will not play in the group phase .
I hope that he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed to be happy , a red card and a suspension of an old .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbit@@ rator , did not pun@@ ish the Mexican .
van G@@ aal assumed that the Italian refer@@ ee had er@@ r .
you can decide for yourself if I say that an ellip@@ se and a red card was due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
a twe@@ et to Sha@@ ws account : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words can &apos;t describe it , as broken I am , my way to recovery start now , I &apos;m coming back again . &quot;
here@@ after : Manchester United has been suffering the loss of Luke Sha@@ w with the defeat at PS@@ V
the UK def@@ enders has an additional incenti@@ ve to recover from the European Championship in France up to the coming June .
Philli@@ p Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V coach , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
when a player leaves from injury to the square , all are very sad .
it is never the intention of our players to viol@@ ate an enemy .
Mor@@ eno suffered a break @-@ break when Mexico at Van Ga@@ as Holland team played at the World Cup 2014 .
&quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to viol@@ ate the opponent , and if you hear that it is a very bad injury , this is not good , &quot; said Coc@@ u .
it wasn &apos;t possible to see the moment at the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball who had gone towards another direction , so it looked as if he had touched him , but I could not see the attack on Luke .
talking with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be .
I feel really po@@ or@@ ly doing it . sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to the hospital - after a s@@ oul@@ play by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron The Lor@@ ax knows better ?
it is a matter to learn all the parents : if your child loves a book it will not take long until you know it almost extensively .
there be because you are perhaps David Cameron .
when he was asked by a vend@@ or to child care systems , his favourite children &apos;s book decided to call the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , which was released in 1971 , driven by Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a hard choice , writes Cameron in a message on the site of the company Super@@ camps , and continued : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it is a book I like to read my children , for it seems to have an image or a message that we have missed . &quot;
everything nice and good , besides the following paragraph , supp@@ os@@ edly describes the action of the book , a syn@@ op@@ sis of the movie version of 2012 repe@@ ating , the new characters and details added to expand the rather short original text .
&quot; in the id@@ ded town of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all the nature is a commod@@ ity , hopes a boy called Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , met the heart of his dreams , reads , reads , his real name was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was Theodor Se@@ uss Geis@@ el and who died in 1991 , however totally unknown .
as if this was not suspected enough : the text of Cameron is presented in part like summary of the Lor@@ ax film which will be presented on the website of Internet Movie Database , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commod@@ ity , hopes a boy called Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y to win the girl of his dreams .
although he su@@ i@@ ded to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems un@@ likely that Cameron can stri@@ ve the action of the book so much . here is an un@@ named boy , like the local environment through the fried Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ck@@ ling , car@@ v@@ ant nature , &quot; that speaks , &quot; that in the name of the trees , &quot; is rav@@ aged .
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to an assistant , which The Lor@@ ax has not read 20 times in a row in a child .
a Dow@@ ning Street spokes@@ woman said that the text is likely to be released by the Camer@@ oon .
Super@@ camps confirmed that the text of Camer@@ oon was delivered , but there was no other immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was definitely threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult
in Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , it is a difficult task , but if you choose the K@@ ader , the UK for the tour , there is a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat not on my card .
I won &apos;t finish a cast @-@ out victory .
Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ ooks section is probably less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in the Batt@@ ing schedule , and the common market is strong ; they are not able to bear sc@@ ars from 2012 , only a you@@ thful positive adjustment .
with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali was developed as a spin @-@ pass and A@@ DI@@ L Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size on test level , is an option for attack .
this message is based on : Adam Ly@@ th , from the England test box and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision of Adam Ly@@ ons , of course , is of course for me as its head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , who is difficult to analyze .
in his seven tests there were two good attacks in difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that crime players are al@@ igned to results .
there were no fragments of Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , as - and I said that - players are their own best to choose .
a lot of time would have been extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own dest@@ iny .
when he finds out new sl@@ ings for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance will get out .
the England trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his position , even though he did not have so good services , and it was surprised me ; he is especially a team man .
the question how much time is a test impact driver gets in order to be his character is difficult .
Ly@@ th received seven chances - as Sam Rob@@ son got before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton 9 received nine .
just Comp@@ ton got the chance to return home and down@@ wards .
the only thing that you can lift when England was first taken over Jonathan Des@@ p@@ ite in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th in the Caribbean - but this lost chance will now be in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a demol@@ man , whom I highly int@@ end .
he is a X @-@ factor cri@@ cket , which we saw in Yor@@ k@@ shire early this season , when it hit 236 with us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge place what happened to us .
he must have at least the same opportunities as they received before him , but it depends on the list of numbers in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to allow Mo@@ vies to Cook so get to get an extra @-@ spin dr@@ ills and get four Qu@@ icks , I got rid of it , and I have nothing about it .
I do not see why a banner can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ handed has already shown that he is a Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ er@@ l of Cri@@ cket Players .
Mo@@ een has probably not done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is no number 3 for her , and there is no big difference .
my earlier team @-@ mate Just@@ in Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests when he appeared as a Op@@ ener in 2001 .
he immediately abolished three hundred p@@ aces and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari arrives in the k@@ itt@@ als as back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited use with him he has greatly impressed me as a young man .
people may see its statistics - on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it is a ple@@ unt , but there is no large number of backup sp@@ inn@@ ers that lift up their hands and the trainer would have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the crew , England made a couple of wise supplements in the Train@@ ers .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ es , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as an advisor for the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est fel@@ lows of the game , who will bring an abundance of experiences because he has performed under all conditions and to all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood is for the white ball phase of the tour , bringing energy and powerful operation into the setup .
I always felt that he created for the International Cri@@ cket Competition , as a player or as a coach , and how Mah@@ ela has insight , of which we can benefit .
sometimes new votes can bring fresh rain in the locker cabin , even if the news are in line with the previously said .
Coll@@ ys team@@ rider at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , will not be used at the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot was a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with this .
some actions not agree , but Co@@ aches and team @-@ formers are not able to set the schedule .
and you must remember that , as with players , depending on the results , are tied to the results .
such decisions are not taken by light heart .
the Bre@@ x@@ it camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = Out@@ off Great Britain from the EU ) could win an order if the economy continue until 2017 .
David Cameron Prot@@ ected Re@@ placement strategy to keep Great Britain in the EU , will always be deeper into trouble with every day , even without the election of the brilliant mind . &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; cor@@ b@@ n to the leader of Labour or TU@@ C , who rode on Tuesday because of Europe on Tuesday .
there are also their Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages too .
a European diplom@@ at graduate , as soon as EU member states , deeply sho@@ cked down in various cris@@ es , such as the EU is now and not always from their own debt , Great Britain , and un@@ distur@@ bing conclusion , which they mostly are not satisfied , are satisfied .
in Brigh@@ ton the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting today that it does not like to end@@ anger the social protection .
we could call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie &apos;s agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb on summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capit@@ als , take a photograph of itself in front of a famous local monument with or without local sizes , come home and say that they win allies for re@@ forms .
it &apos;s all about me .
my European friend , who wishes to wish the outside of the EU plan , &quot; Let us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and reveals that more and more short @-@ term ministers and civil servants have come into some major cities until the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we are or going .
Germany : German Chancellor Angela Merkel is a allies but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the position before it looks bad@@ ly for them , as it happened during the ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated endurance such as Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
French François Hollande can look back on his re @-@ election or its replacement in 2017 .
it is also a bl@@ asting force .
Poland may soon become a national@@ ist government , Spain .
it is difficult to imagine that they will help themselves a leg to prevent the help of the Sel@@ f@@ ie Brit@@ ons to prevent the energy from the UK - something , what they do not want to do because of the most similar separ@@ at@@ ist tenden@@ cies .
hence , some such ministers must be clearly perc@@ ep@@ tible ann@@ ot@@ ations , quite in the SN@@ P @-@ style , during the UK &apos;s spokes@@ man campaign in 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , put my friend .
&quot; the re@@ trial was a ple@@ ite &quot; and &quot; Great Britain has won nothing from the new trial . &quot;
Europeans know how to burn incense on their costs and which EU sk@@ ep@@ tics of the press @-@ bar@@ ons , as they did not have inspired by Tony Ben@@ n during the 1975 by Tony Ben@@ n , who supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you can remember Boris Johnson , the ore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU @-@ Straight &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in all his comp@@ res@@ ins , Ed Mil@@ i@@ band knew , who had his enemies .
it was also one of the Med@@ ley of tax tum@@ ult bu@@ ds , telephone @-@ h@@ ack@@ ing foreigners , and the pseud@@ o non @-@ investment , which own most of our large newspapers .
actually Tony Bl@@ air was thinking about it , but he noted that when one sits with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , one better spread out ban@@ anas at him , instead of having lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mil@@ i@@ band was more Bl@@ ai@@ ri@@ ans than Bl@@ air himself when he was contra@@ cted in the Camer@@ oon to the rule of the EU , which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which then opened a back@@ door .
the press never stopped it .
but the nice Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly fl@@ aps on the back in Westminster - I told him that he doesn &apos;t need time for me to repeat that - appears in danger , Neil Kin@@ no@@ cks Bo@@ boy@@ cott Mur@@ derer strategy of the 80 @-@ 90s , a mistake at that time and today .
it can take , but it must develop a coh@@ er@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa has left on Sunday .
Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s official position to Europe is - I press it really - in development .
he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside the U@@ ki@@ ps traditional wind @-@ growing tendency and the wild poems of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can say Yes to everyone .
it &apos;s what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and television this week did not to ad@@ mit that Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s &apos;s appointment of the prov@@ oked John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell designed a bad idea as a shadow ch@@ anc@@ er .
it also remin@@ ded me of the 70 &apos;s , when his old father ende@@ av@@ oured to keep on the TV cabinet , il@@ lo@@ yal to his stuff cabin without losing too far and lose his cabin job .
Hil@@ de@@ ys Stru@@ g@@ gle was even more attractive .
but to fight with &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ y expression - was not that what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , even what J@@ C had his fellow mighty men and members after all reports on Monday night .
what does always wants to conv@@ ey the bottom of bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n - keep in mind that it even touched me - News discipline remains in the age of TV around the clock and especially in the Stru@@ del of Social Media , a breeding place of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
it is true , Cameron does not give a free ticket for Europe that allowed him to keep lab@@ ours support in the refer@@ end@@ ancy campaign , such as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said .
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins always th@@ inks that .
but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s basic comprehensive contribution to EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite loading economy , of their anti @-@ capitalist society - is no longer a question of the Chinese discussion under left dis@@ sidents , for which the Nar@@ c@@ is@@ sm@@ us of the small bond is a central basic set of dog@@ matic dispute .
as with its majority comm@@ it@@ ments to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son , fel@@ low@@ proof was convinced that J@@ C will not have any campaign to withdrawal - will be foreign diplom@@ ats to try to find in everything a sense of their superior home .
why should Paris or Berlin advoc@@ ate political capital - they also have trouble shooting - to make conc@@ essions to the British when it can be point@@ less ?

an editorial in the medical journal The Lanc@@ et of the last month handle an extra@@ ordin@@ arily win@@ dy basis , based on the br@@ oth &apos;s most important conclusion .
two further researchers have written in BM@@ J , and asked whether the alleg@@ ations are made on stone or sand . &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epi@@ de@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
they said that the public anticip@@ ates that &quot; the current best estimate is that E @-@ cigarettes is about 95 % less harmful to smoking &quot; in a detailed review of methods and modelling .
in fact , this statement is made up of a single session of 12 people who were appointed to develop a model for a multi@@ purpose criteria ( Multi @-@ Crit@@ eria Decision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to conduct their opinions about the damage of various Nik@@ ot@@ ine products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were combined into a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director was previously received by British American Tob@@ acco ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also under@@ wrote the references of BA@@ T for public health in a sustainability report , saying it .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting ple@@ dged to receive the means of an E @-@ cigarettes producer , but not funding , which he report@@ edly received reports before by tobacco companies Philip Morris International , added them .
the reasons for the selection of members of the Gre@@ at@@ ums are not supplied but several well @-@ known E @-@ cigarettes instruments , some of which have also specify a sector financing in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
the tobacco management of P@@ he participated in the meeting .
the Group &apos;s research work &quot; refers to the fact that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damages of most products in most of the criteria &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well .
yet none of these links or restrictions mentioned in the P@@ he report will be discussed .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that there is no evidence that there is no evidence that E @-@ cigarettes as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smoking &quot; were early .
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , director of health and well @-@ being at P@@ he said that BM@@ J has already responded to the alleg@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E @-@ cigarettes are considerably less harmful as smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ kers dies in his ad@@ diction .
all evidence suggests that health Ris@@ ks of E @-@ cigarettes are small comparing to this , but we continue to study long @-@ term effects .
P@@ he has the unique obligation to provide the information of public opinion about what of proof and what does not , especially when producing as much confusion about relative d@@ angers by comparison to tobacco .
almost 80,000 people die annually in a disease with regards to smoking , and smoking costs the National healthcare system £ 2 billion per year .
by clear evidence of current evidence that E @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fra@@ ction of damage caused by the smoking , we comply with our national jurisdiction .
BBC should release East@@ En@@ ders , former Chief of Channel 4
the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said that the BBC should stop to send programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ val &quot; would give their right arms &quot; for Hit shows as the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should only be used to do the kind of programs which are not transmitted by other UK transmitter .
it critic@@ ised the BBC for ensuring it publicly @-@ legal programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in hard around time window against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and radio stations such as BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC @-@ General , Tony rever@@ ber@@ ance , the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he was trying to come in touch with the BBC for six years in his time at Channel 4 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have trouble with the idea that BBC programs may be commissioned or send them clearly the un@@ conventional Ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus communications committee in the context of his study on the future of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to hold the broadcast fee , what I want to hold medium or long term not for good idea , one should not make its production at least on programs that do not make or put in order .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class window because they want to achieve a broad support for their future .
the idea that nobody would show this is joke , it is ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous , it is naturally non@@ sense .
Johnson said : &quot; I do not see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax programs is financed , which could be financed without subsi@@ dies .
the Voice is a such program , East@@ en@@ ders is another , possibly ad@@ mitt@@ edly both in @-@ productions .
hon@@ est@@ ly , other channels would give their right arm .
I would like to see me how this is to be public @-@ legal television .
I don &apos;t think that the BBC would like to decrease .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , the Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 was said that the BBC bl@@ ame was on the hunt for reviews , &quot; because of the amb@@ itions of people working there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long term support . &quot;
his comments on the most popular categories of BBC , the BBC , which was the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart session in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows should be sold like East@@ En@@ ders .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal N@@ ative programs &quot; to BB@@ C4 should go , but they meet their tasks , and they may ar@@ gue that , of course , we have created all these ob@@ sc@@ ary programs that nobody has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which no one would ever see it .
in the radio charge , Johnson said the committee : &quot; I challenge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions that can get the best value this .
of course , you are all thinking about that one gets a great value for £ 150 a year , but for people who is for £ 150 a lot of money , ask myself if that &apos;s right , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC .
the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also testified before the Committee on Tuesday , called that the BBC would review its th@@ th@@ ian mission , &quot; to make and enter@@ tain . &quot;
he said , only little of the BBC &apos;s production would now officially classified as education - he said that it would have 1 % of their TV production , and 0.1 % on the radio , and it should be informed about publicly @-@ legal television sen@@ ders in Australia and Canada , for example , to elabor@@ ate and enter@@ tain . &quot;
to the question of the partner@@ ships , El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas such as the pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a hand@@ ful of television can be displayed , and to make any commerci@@ ally available alli@@ ances in order to make all online available .
&apos;@@ Son@@ at@@ et@@ ics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the r@@ emat@@ odes occur in the moment in which they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound im@@ pulses .
scientists have been bred wor@@ ms with genet@@ ically modified ner@@ ve systems that can be controlled by le@@ ver@@ aging of sound waves .
the tiny N@@ emat@@ odes change the direction in the moment , in which they have sound im@@ pulse for the human ear to have high frequencies , to be radi@@ ated radi@@ ated .
the im@@ pulses are triggered by turning on mot@@ one@@ ur@@ on cells that are genet@@ ically modified to absorb the membrane channels , which are based on ultr@@ asound waves .
further regarding this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said that wor@@ ms showed the power of a new procedure called son@@ at@@ et@@ ics , where ultr@@ asound is used to activate a series of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Srebrenica municipality conducted at Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the depths of n@@ aval stim@@ ulation , an inv@@ as@@ ive method that gives electric im@@ pulses to the brain of people to treat symptoms of Park@@ inson &apos;s disease .
F@@ ad@@ di@@ ers react normally not to ultr@@ asound , but chal@@ as@@ ani pointed out that they did it when they were surrounded by a fluid with micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic air bub@@ bles .
the bub@@ bles , he found , intensi@@ fy the ultr@@ asound waves , which then penet@@ rate into dig@@ nity .
the ampli@@ fied ultr@@ asound waves impact on structures that are known as TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and can be found in the membran@@ es of some of the lit@@ ters .
the sound waves absorb the opening of these hed@@ ging channels and enable the cells to as@@ sign them according to the nature Communications .
to create ultr@@ asound examination , genet@@ ics modified chal@@ as@@ ani genet@@ ically modified dig@@ nity for instance , that some of their m@@ aturing oh@@ em@@ ons TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels would carry .
when he is able to use ultr@@ asound on the changed creatures , the sound waves are strengthened by micro@@ f@@ axes and transfer them into dig@@ nity , where they turn off the changed Mot@@ one@@ world .
the procedure has some simil@@ ar@@ ities with op@@ to@@ genet@@ ics , a ground@@ breaking tool that scientists enables to switching neur@@ ons with im@@ pulses of light and discharge .
however , Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Der@@ mat@@ et@@ ics could have some advantages compared to this technology .
in contrast to light that has to be sent down to an optical fiber to the desired position in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultr@@ asound tissue may be un@@ hin@@ dered and can be sent to the brain from above on the sk@@ ul@@ ls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with care and a therapeutic Virus , human neur@@ ons is temporarily transferred to the ultr@@ asound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurolog@@ ical treatments &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and ins@@ ulin @-@ producing cells , and added .

but a separate campaign also leads to many posters that are on bus stops and to the subway trains that require a second glance .
&quot; important announcement : go from the 15th to 18th of September with the D@@ LR ? &quot; ( Do@@ ck@@ lands Light Railway ) you read in the font types of the London Under@@ ground and the trademark of the D@@ LR line , which turns into the picture of a arm@@ or .

the 300 posters are of artists who have exhibited their work in the Museum of cruel designs in Ban@@ ks@@ y Dis@@ mal@@ ine .

V@@ C@@ CP @-@ creative director Matt L@@ ever was astonished at the silence that ruled around the advertising for the arms trade - through a laying of an Excel calendar - and thought : &quot; we give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot;
they played with the invention of a more realistic company advertising , but &quot; through the in@@ blu@@ ish with bright colors and animation becomes stronger . &quot;
&quot; they have made a fantastic job by helping us to shar@@ pen awareness about the sale of illegal acts of torture on the trade fair , &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nesty .

eight golden rules for life in student residence
after eleven years ago , I moved to a student residence in a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral re@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the cl@@ amped smile of those who I have been anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , long @-@ scen@@ ic complaints about others .
most of what I learned , can be dist@@ illed in eight simple rules .
the train in a residence room ranges from slightly nerv@@ ous until almost completely sho@@ ck@@ ingly .
it is temp@@ ting to bu@@ zz@@ y : people tell whence you come , whether and where you have taken the Sabbath year , where you don &apos;t love to hate , because in Ernst , guys , it is just a yeast extract h@@ ah@@ aha that I am in my room . &quot;
bre@@ athe out through .
to help others to do the same - do questions and show interest .
it direc@@ ts the conversation and helps you to figure out those who would not like to speak with which you would not say even if your lashes would be fire , and these fire extingu@@ ishers would be .
let men leave people .
the rooms of people often turn to drinks in drinks , film @-@ night venues and municipal residents , but they are also the places where people under@@ go and their under@@ wear .
to be related to this : do not think any of the university with a relationship
introduction : a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but a lot of student homes compos@@ e a room @-@ to @-@ room @-@ b@@ um@@ mel culture that is friendly and soci@@ ally and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone who is trying to recover .
nothing in the culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want to continue our friendship , but you &apos;d go away to keep the energy , that I have used for the interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a com@@ it@@ ones of soci@@ ability is exhau@@ sted - and send him a text instead of kno@@ ck .
A@@ pro@@ po@@ s ank@@ ets : do it . do it .
a guy in my student residence had the idea that a not closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship ar@@ ship through baking .
since you begin the University at the peak of the Back @-@ Man@@ ie , kno@@ cking on the doors of people to present himself with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es , less strange as the welcome of the 1950 @-@ ies &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I have something new to you . so , and now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions . &quot;
homemade past@@ ry shops is a good way to join friendship .
their roomm@@ ates feel committed to enter@@ tain and will associate your face with a delicious surprise at the end .
of course this depends on whether you are an independent b@@ aker .
bad@@ ly mixed lot of pumps , of flour , sugar and fat make people sleeping , when you stick in it .
food to steal , is an exceptional crime in student residence .
of course is it theft of theft , but is it the use of a drop of milk for your tea ?
check it with the dairy farm .
the od@@ ds are good to say they themselves to use themselves , even if they cook inside the inner .
if anyone ste@@ als your stuff , is the anno@@ ying , and you have my compassion , but try to go to balanced as my roomm@@ ates , who added to their milk a r@@ ins@@ ing pot for th@@ iev@@ es .
she is now in prison .
they should make no noise , that keeps people from sleep or from work .
it is not only about it to be an independent man , but that you sit in the tru@@ est sense of a saying to people who sit in glass .
a girl in my way asked its neigh@@ bors , if there is something to make them drums , drums &amp; bass left a little qui@@ eter , because it was at least three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a examination in the morning .
they responded with even more lu@@ ent music .
when she ceased at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly left her neigh@@ bors who had left their own music before she ended her own music and went to her three @-@ hour trial .
would it not be romantic when your future sp@@ ouse would pass by chance in the same student union ?
on the other way , it would not be deep de@@ struc@@ tible , if you have a roomm@@ ates for your future husband , to re@@ signs to them and then to experience it every day and perhaps to see how they merge all common friends ?
of course the heart continues its own ways - but if a hot student is definitely not your future husband is in , try to utter a little bit of mind .
in the exciting moment you notice that someone has put his keys in his not closed room , the border between a Ul@@ k and Mo@@ b@@ bing f@@ one , when it seems .
a good beam is funny , but it only takes moments until it gets to banks .
create a valuable and am@@ using le@@ ection via security - but please never forget som@@ eb@@ ody &apos;s room with t@@ ooth@@ paste and sh@@ ampoo .
connect your door , and place your keys into a glass of water , which you will then put in the freezer - but drives your poss@@ essions in the ceiling no more than twice fixed .
H@@ ousing Complex for refugees , dancing , Ger@@ ing@@ de@@ ans
the real estate business Markus Gil@@ cen@@ aries builds in Central Dutch Eck@@ ental H@@ ousing Complex for people who do not have a lot of money .
so for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; not only refugees need residential space , but also the mother &apos;s be@@ ating mother and the Ger@@ ing@@ de@@ q . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I show how you can still use it today and well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees are dr@@ um@@ ed on the housing market .
the business@@ man Markus Gil@@ deb@@ tors to know how the cheaper living space can be created : he builds in a project tow@@ n@@ houses for refugees .
Mr. Gil@@ deb@@ tors , many refugees to enter the apartment market .
which solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ ich : major placing accommodation in containers or g@@ ym@@ s has no sustainability .
for men remain in a large part here .
because of the refugee flow we need sufficient space in the next decades .
a very general , three @-@ storey detached house is the solution .
Gil@@ ere : a tow@@ n@@ house usually needs first place .
it makes easy integration .
that &apos;s different if people under@@ takes people to blocks .
each of the six houses built in the pilot project , consists of three residential units for each of four asylum seek@@ ers .
each residential unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it may be that many refugees will say , there is again peace , I go back .
then the houses can easily be converted to suit according to their needs .
how high are the cost ?
Gil@@ ere : price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 euros , without any property .
this is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction lasted six months .
this is reasonable .
do the regulations have their plans complicated ?
Gil@@ deb@@ tors : I &apos;ve moved my project correctly .
especially complicated , it is always the lik@@ el@@ ating ladies value of special construction and the slot regulations .
gr@@ us@@ el@@ y .
there is still under@@ going , who creates three apartments in one row , needs three tourist pitches .
only in the cities there is space .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did he react to their tow@@ n@@ house project ?
Gil@@ deb@@ tors : there were those who have prepared me to create luxury structures for asylum seek@@ ers .
what definitely is not correct .
but did you not merge the compet@@ itor to pay paid apartments ?
Gil@@ deb@@ tors : true , we had a building boom in Germany for the last five years , but built luxury apartments , which can hardly perform any more .
my project has the message , also the normal people need residential space .
not only refugees , but also the fre@@ igh@@ ter mother or Ger@@ ing@@ de@@ q .
I &apos;ll show you how to conveniently build and build this day today .
so it goes .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple Update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the adjusting app , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Android &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; software update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

some are after the installation contra@@ dic@@ ate them because they get an error message that the &quot; software update is missing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to circum@@ vent the problem , users are advised to have either to wait until the attack is back , or to try to update via iTunes .
the telephone itself takes you through the rest of the process .
this may possibly mean the delete of apps to make space - but Apple has made it more likely to do this through the van@@ ishing of updates . as well , it will be easier to install apps if you install a special tool , once the process is completed .
it is worth to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charging unit , so that your battery is loaded .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to be continued , since the phone is likely to stop on half @-@ way and lead it to a breakdown of updates .

men prove a 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
witnesses to the police in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 p.m. , three young men were travelling on foot from Bad So@@ den in the direction of Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one of the group , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old communist , followed by the police in a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at that point , the group was at the height of the b@@ ft gas station .
there are also three persons on the site of the gas station .
one of these men now cried out with the young people , and struck this with his f@@ ist .
the sacrifice suffered a nostr@@ ils and heavily damaged from the nose .
when his two friends came , lifting and lifting for the ra@@ cket , he made it first by his sacrifice .
of his friends , the last young man was brought home now .
the perpet@@ rators followed the group with a passenger car to their apartment and sailed several times .
when you saw the car no more , the insur@@ rection was in front of the building to smoke a cig@@ ar .
there he was again attacked by the ra@@ cket and another male person .
under the help of a punch bag , beat on the face and th@@ igh@@ s of the victim .

Dr. Frank Müller takes over Practice Fel@@ low and invests 3@@ 10000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ low .
also , also the partner of partner Bernd Bor@@ mann , economic production in U@@ ta S@@ eim @-@ Schwartz and As@@ endor@@ fs mayor of Hein@@ fried Cab@@ bert .
working in many places on the country - As@@ endorf gave his luck to the country : Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of Fel@@ tre on October 1 .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ low goes into retirement , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still going on for his successor in the next months even with half a place .
after the construction phase , Mu@@ eller opened its practice on October 12th , till then he is investing 3@@ 10000 Euro to the premises at the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ straße 6 .
it was sympath@@ y at the first glance , when the rock faces before years Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll know who is currently completing her specialist vocational training in the local hospital and who wants to join the practice back again .
&quot; we always had in mind that the bags would be good in this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ tre and laugh@@ s .
&quot; when it was so far , I simply called them . &quot;
the couple Müller was the idea of working our own practice in As@@ endorf .
&quot; the proximity and permanent contact to the patient are very attractive for us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old m@@ iller .
&quot; we want to learn and accompany the families over the years . &quot;
as an advantage , he too can see his own boss himself .
and so one was amaz@@ ed , the m@@ tr@@ ash bought the house with practice .
they will continue to live in Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
there , the two @-@ time family father Frank Müller grew up also in Hanover , completing his medical studies in Hannover and in several medical practices and hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently active as a Senior Physi@@ cian in Sul@@ ingen , in addition , he was appointed Chief Doctor of Di@@ ep@@ ywood in 2009 and is working on a volunte@@ er in the DR@@ K read@@ iness of Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
from 19 September the practice for the new boss will be prepared .
during the sur@@ geon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ iz breaks as a house doctor , his wife speci@@ alis@@ es in Ur@@ sel ( Inter@@ ni@@ st@@ in ) speci@@ alis@@ es in Gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology .
the tr@@ ash , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to leave themselves as a house@@ keeper .
&quot; the End@@ os@@ copy comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll .
after the conversion , the rooms of modern look will look like .
we will offer more ultr@@ asound tests as well as long @-@ term and endurance EC@@ GS and need a speaker room more .
in addition the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
a surplus of 50000 Euros get the tr@@ ash in the framework of a promotional programme from the County ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and from the Community ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and glad we are , that the practice is continued , &quot; emphas@@ ises the fact , &quot; emphas@@ ises &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; under@@ lines Sam@@ t@@ char@@ ing mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
approximately 2000 patients come to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll every quarter in the practice of Fel@@ low , in the northern German average group there are about 500 .
in As@@ endorf there is another house practice yet .
a positive side effect of practice by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains no@@ isy in the Ur@@ sel Fel@@ tre in As@@ endorf .
if no successor had been found , she would have gone .
and whoever tou@@ ches the tr@@ ash cur@@ few , looks even above all in familiar faces : take over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning force of the rock climbing .
with their departure , in As@@ endorf an era , after all , the physician had pract@@ ised for 30 years there .
&quot; at the beginning , we had only two rooms , &quot; re@@ members the gu@@ ile rock climbing .
she has long lived long after the long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and many patients often see , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Inter@@ ni@@ st@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband adds : &quot; we have a 6000 square meter property . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I pressed me ahead of gar@@ dening , now that might be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moreover , the pair has two grand@@ children and travels .
Croatia : &quot; we let the refugees go through &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the border controls are made at our south border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Interior Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls on the Hungarian border remain parallel in parallel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is clear that everyone who wants to make an asylum request will also be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the supply and safety of people understand in the fore@@ ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is clear , however , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that it takes clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people need to know that we don &apos;t accept lim@@ it@@ less migration flows , even beyond the Austrian @-@ Slovenian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia Con@@ si@@ ves &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia ref@@ uses to refuse
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian government had previously reported that Slovenia would continue to pass on refugee refugees in Austria and Germany , including cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees too . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so far this Minister of Interior Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ ll@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in La@@ bach did not see it .
the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors be &quot; absolutely un@@ acceptable , &quot; Slovenia will rather be the monitoring of the border - especially in Hungary - intensi@@ fied .
however , the border with Croatia is as an outdoor border from the line period .
as the Minister is stressed , Slovenia wants to carry out its borders for refugees but does not die .
&quot; each EU member must fill his obligations , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; emphas@@ ized Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ ll@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar .
as the Croatian government revealed that the first refugees had already tried in the night hours to Tuesday to break in East c@@ roati@@ a at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ ID to avoid the registration .
in the late corn fields , the Croatian police site was able to lay up in the nearby corn fields .
according to local media , since then , in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , police vehicles meet the number of refugees .
there are mainly around Syrian and Afghanistan , including numerous women and children .
even rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days , its country with around 4000 refugees suggest Minister of Interior , Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pre@@ se@@ vo would be transferred to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian Serb border with immig@@ rants from the Hungarian border to the Hungarian border in Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
the government in Belgrade , however , suffered from being able to inter@@ c@@ ate certain routes : &quot; neither can we do , nor do we want to do this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to media reports , in the morning there was a first bus with around 50 refugees in the Serbian town of S@@ ID , while further buses were expected during the day .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants were the entire night of some 500 kilometres distant to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border by Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary has made us , so the police told us that we should go here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
so it could actually be the pre @-@ cancelled shi@@ fting of the previous Balkan @-@ route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a little further west of the route .
Croatia : &quot; complete opportunities for the border control &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously st@@ ressing that his country has prepared appropriate plans for potential exceptional state situations for the fall of a strong state of refugees .
he did not accept details , but he pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen Member &quot; provides comprehensive opportunities for border control . &quot;
you lead strict controls to qualify for the membership in the Schengen Area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , since then the EU partners introduce a good testimony to the country , regarding the standard of border checks .
on the same page , some 300 refugees have remained ste@@ amed on this site .
according to the media reports , they lost the past night at the border crossing of Hor@@ g@@ os , who was le@@ ased to R@@ ös@@ ler .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border over@@ runs Hor@@ g@@ os and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain fully locked .
the remaining people now wish to travel to the Croatian border will still be un@@ clear .
Serbian Minister of Interior Neb@@ oj@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic tried to calm on Wednesday morning at a local rh@@ einf@@ alls in Hor@@ g@@ os : he stop the debates concerning alternative residents of refugees , after the Hungarian border is closed .
it would not be able to deal for very long refugee action .
you could not say if they would continue their journey in Hungary , Croatia or another country .
workers of migrants - hazardous - Alternative items
however , private Hungarian refugee workers have already begun to distribute the refugees on which alternative routes through Croatia through Croatia .
but the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not harm@@ less : in parts of the territory there are also 20 years after the end of the conflict there is still not any cleared min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of min@@ ors had been sent to the border region .

in this way , the investigations were launched over a total of 100 million dollars .
&quot; the present comparison shows that even those outside our state borders may finally be caught , &quot; it is written in the SEC @-@ Noti@@ fication .

F@@ ed@@ Ex result mixed , financial prospects for 2016 reduced
F@@ ed@@ Ex reported dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the Lie@@ ber @-@ Gig@@ ant sen@@ tim@@ ed his winning sight to a whole year due to the weaker demand for cargo services and higher costs in its bo@@ oming transport service .
the company also said that she plans to hold approximately 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for their holidays .
at that time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to set 50.000 seasonal workers for vacation period .
the share was reduced by 2.5 percent at the Pre@@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. Announ@@ ces a profit between 10.@@ 40 $ and 10,@@ 90 $ in the fiscal year , which ends in May , 20 cents less than in previous forecast .
an@@ alysts expect a survey conducted by Fac@@ t@@ set 10,@@ 84 $ .
the lower view comes despite the increases of increases , which will amount to 4.9 percent and on 4th January , and despite the higher charges for Bo@@ d@@ ling sports by heavy and large packages , which will be collected from November .
the company said it nonetheless anticip@@ ates that the result from the previous year due to cost reduction , higher income , and due to growth in online trading will increase .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith states that the company will bring a solid balance if they are weaker than expected economic conditions , particularly in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
plans for the holidays were announced a day later than the Ri@@ val@@ en UPS , who plans to hold 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , roughly the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share stood at 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just behind the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve from Z@@ acks Investment Research announced an@@ alysts predi@@ ct .
sales increased by 5 percent to USD 12.@@ 3 billion .
the an@@ alysts were expecting an expected 12.@@ 23 billion US .
in recent years F@@ ed@@ Ex has posted a decline in international priority @-@ shipping , which brought revenue in his unit exp@@ edited shipping .
the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter sales increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat for higher packages and self @-@ insurance costs .
the Express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices , while the result of higher labour costs in the cargo ship decreased .
at the Pre@@ market trade , about an hour before the opening , declined the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,15 $ .
on Tuesday they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent under a record high June 11 .
when the most expected conference in the year , Federal Reserve Strat@@ es spend two days this week round about a 27 @-@ foot Honduras @-@ Mah@@ ag@@ oni table , to decide whether it is time for the first time since almost a decade to the leader .
dro@@ us above them at a end of the emb@@ ell@@ ous , two @-@ story seat sa@@ vers is a mur@@ al of the United States .
the map is a memory of fact that the F@@ ed @-@ Chair@@ woman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should set the nation &apos;s economic interests of the nation all other things .
the central bank has a double order of the congress : maximum of US occupation and prices here .
but since the great recession the F@@ ed guides have recognised that it has a third third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be made to the X @-@ factor in a decision to declare it to predi@@ ct . it is announced on Thursday , whether the U.S. economy is ready to get acc@@ ust@@ omed by the un@@ interrupted interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most of the data of the economy would show that they are solid increasing , the latest tur@@ bul@@ ences make the most beneficial role in the global financial markets , increasing this volume by raising the interest rate for federal bonds , and it is only one @-@ quarter percentage point .
&quot; obviously the labour market and inflation is primarily the most important , what they observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief economy at Mak@@ ler@@ oi Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think when they were looking for a pre@@ text , to increase the interest rate , increased un@@ certainty around the global market enough to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no con@@ sens@@ us what F@@ ed will do , which is sec@@ ures on the financial market itself .
about half of the econom@@ ists who were asked by Bloom@@ berg have had predicted a rate of interest this week .
however , the financial markets are expected to wait for an increase in the case with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance on an increase .
this indicates a decline of the stock market if the F@@ ed pl@@ aten the proposition , unless the Strat@@ es dis@@ covers the blow but they promise that another increase is far away .
on Tuesday the Dow Jones Industrial Average st@@ ump@@ ed by 2@@ 28.@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16.@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations resulting from the F@@ ed policy key to this week , John Lon@@ ski , Head econom@@ ist , at Moody &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the propositions at that time , &quot; he said .
if they do it , &quot; would you want to calm everything in their statement to calm the financial markets , lest they come into pan@@ ic . &quot;
other experts argu@@ ed that a interest increase in financial markets might ass@@ ert the certainty when the F@@ ed will act when the F@@ ed should act .
a month before , the F@@ ed seemed to raise a good way to increase the sentence by 0.25 percentage points in this month , the first step in a slow fusion of the mon@@ et@@ ous conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had in spring and early summer , that in this year it said , despite the complaints of liber@@ als that more economic growth would be required to increase the proposition .
although the creation of jobs will slow down in August , the improvement in the labour market was solid .
the unemployment rate declined to 5.1 % last month , the lowest since more than seven years and close to levels that the F@@ ed looks as full employment .
wage gains have been shown in signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly below the target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representative , said that the main reason is the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d@@ son , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ theater . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets around the world gathered at the end of the last month after China had t@@ opped his currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial Average value decreased by more than 16 % in May by more than 16 % of investors , that a slow@@ down from the Chinese economy would thr@@ ott@@ le global growth .
the market has recovered something in this month , with the Dow selection now is almost 10 % below the h@@ och of May .
for the F@@ ed representative , the market tur@@ bul@@ ences influence the complex calculation when you should increase interest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the events were not played on financial markets and news about the weakness of Chinese economy in the past few weeks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at the U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US Music Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now he predic@@ ts that they will wait at least one month to get the effects better in the handle .
&quot; there is a lot of un@@ certainty on what the effects of U.S. economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner .
the health of the world economy is none of the major concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be included technically in their decision @-@ making .
but in the final effect the F@@ ed currency code became the world .
the impact of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
the mere indication of the then leader Ben S. Bern@@ an@@ ke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could restri@@ ct their mon@@ et@@ ric expansion &quot; cro@@ oked , &quot; causing confusion around the world .
in a world , in the markets and econom@@ ies , increasingly inter@@ acted , the F@@ ed @-@ representative are expected to monitor that they are not only advised by the F@@ ed @-@ Represent@@ atives , but also with other central banks and experts to receive a better understanding for the global economy .
their decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of the Global Strategy towards the management of En@@ vest@@ net Inc .
Jeffrey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond , VA . , noticed this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has linked a story of transition activities on financial market movements that are not associated with the economic foundation data . &quot;
l@@ acker , voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , made for a interest increase , quoted decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce their conductivity at 0.75 percentage points in three sessions , &quot; despite lim@@ it@@ uted effects to reduce growth in the US , &quot; L@@ acker said .
a year later the F@@ ed @-@ Represent@@ atives joined this cuts .
the F@@ ed should translate aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis as the market crisis in 2008 , Adam S. Pos@@ en said , a former member of the Committee for com@@ missions of the Bank of England .
the youngest tur@@ bul@@ ences come not close to this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surely she will not come into the situation , in which it has a fear of interest , because the markets emerged in exc@@ itement , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Pozn@@ an , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act once again contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until this is altered , I don &apos;t think that it should be drop@@ ping the time .

Bras@@ ili@@ ens pap@@ di@@ at@@ ric Society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy eating
the Brazilian pedi@@ at@@ ric organization S@@ RS tries to clari@@ fy women about it , how important good food during the breast@@ feeding is . she doing this with the presentation of pictures of babies that are painted on breasts , who are painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy food .
breast milk consists of a large variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates , to give babies all the nutrients that they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by around 500 calories per day .
however , new research results indicate that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only di@@ eting ability to make mothers .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet really stim@@ ulated the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , a healthy diet of the child can affect the immune system negative .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Sports Hall
the par@@ l@@ at Bern@@ hof has approved the construction site for the 2,3 million euro expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof can be flat@@ ter for solar installation .
planning for long @-@ sigh@@ ted movement of the Bern@@ tri@@ ke sports premises are step forward : in the youngest common meeting the work was blessed without further discussion .
previously , the board had also approved a request for a national legal basis &quot; Der@@ tive &quot; Liberation &quot; of the valid plan of construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it went up with permission to build a special form of the attic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; arti@@ ch@@ ach roof with non @-@ mit@@ ag@@ ulated first and roof stands &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are to be built . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; background of planning is the planned use of roof@@ space for solar systems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we get a wonder@@ fully big South @-@ dd@@ ings , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the session . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in turn , in turn , it went back to the roof pitch , which should be prescribed for energet@@ ic reasons - otherwise than in the development plan - below ten degrees .
the volume of the hall is considerably reduced significantly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the plan of construction regarding the roof climb wasn &apos;t &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the Am@@ rie@@ der Municipal Coun@@ cill@@ or for any restrictions related to the liberation orders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the turn@@ around is not a recur@@ ring project : &quot; we do not create a precision waste , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger .
the sports centre at the sports centre is a community project of the community and SV Bern@@ ese .
in costs , approximately 2,3 million euros have been calculated .
grants are expected from school and lat@@ itud@@ inal promotion .
for the next step of proce@@ eding , the construction site for the 18 x 36 metre hall is placed into the country @-@ rate and the trial .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m closing down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White could not say there are several consider@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently there are a short @-@ time bike of Car@@ itas and a tag@@ @-@ sy@@ chiat@@ ry .
&quot; what better could happen to us , such a opportunity does not happen again , &quot; fishermen on the Qu@@ res@@ i move to Le@@ ch , who had been recorded &quot; positi@@ vely and very compreh@@ en@@ sible . &quot;
a real perspective for the house where fishermen worked for over 30 years as a leader , did not have it .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take the post of the medical Director .
the hospital of P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was threatened during the past decades and was closed again by closure , departments became closed , for example the surgery and corporate assistance .

refugees need accommodations : study war@@ ns against Resi@@ dential gap
the location of the German house market is ten@@ sion@@ ing .
even more refugees seek an affordable stay .
pressure on the apartment market grows .
social housing is facing a challenge .
the distribution mission in the German residential market have long gone .
with the coming refugees and labour @-@ seek@@ ers from the EU , more people are on a market that has now been over@@ loaded in many major cities .
they compete with income w@@ aking up citizens of the last paid apartments .
in order to cover the demand for paid apartments , 400,000 units would have to be built by 2020 .
the result is a study commissioned by the collaboration of &quot; Social Resi@@ dential Systems . &quot;
for comparison , 26@@ 0,000 units are done in Germany this year .
this means 14@@ 0,000 apartments .
refugees are no longer required for the first three months of their stay than asylum seek@@ ers in an initial public accommodation .
many of them go to the apartment store and store in the long sn@@ akes in front of the rental dwellings .
according to Statist@@ ical Office , in the last year less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers stayed for rent .
however , the negative development of the housing market is not only to the rising losses .
the study also makes significant slan@@ der@@ ations in residential policy of the last years .
Germany Sli@@ th@@ iev@@ es a housing deficit in front of itself , which is increased from year to year .
currently , Matthias Günther , author of the study was still missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas of approximately 77@@ 0,000 units .
numerous professional people lived in major cities in WG @-@ rooms .
young adults stayed for longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama . &quot; due to the floo@@ ded in the apartment store .
in big cities , the number of square metres per capita has sunk again in recent years .
in order to solve the problem the Alliance &quot; Social Resi@@ dential Development &quot; suggests a re@@ boot .
new incenti@@ ves will boost the social housing construction again .
thus the property tax could be w@@ ai@@ ded and the basic tax for subsidi@@ zed dwellings are exposed to subsidi@@ zed housing .
this subject to attractive tax am@@ or@@ ti@@ zation possibilities also be required in accordance with the Alliance .
the sponsor@@ ship Program for Refu@@ ge@@ es Kf@@ W occurs quite well in cities and communities .
a good week after the start was announced on Monday evening with 184 million euros more than half of the costs available at around 300 million euros .
now the project could even be buil@@ dt .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia establish a corridor
according to Hungary , practically no more , there are more refugees visiting the road to Croatia in more than Croatia .
Zagreb announces that there will be a passage through Slovenia in the north without the hur@@ d@@ les .
dangerous is the route but still .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country Slovenia about the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke with the Slovenian interior minister , and when it &apos;s necessary we will organize a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Croatian Minister of Interior , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is between Croatia and Austria and is already one of the Schengen area .
the EU country Croatia is still not a Schengen country .
according to the Serbian Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to arrive in Western Europe from there .
500 people were come over the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , for the RTL Television Academy RTL .
Hungary had sailed its border for refugees on the day before .
new laws , which came into force on the same day , do almost super@@ flu@@ ous asylum procedures in Hungary .
Croatia wants to pass the refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Mil@@ ano@@ vic explained : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they can go through , and we are preparing for that way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and reach something .
there are , however , people who do not want to live in Croatia .
in the morning , the Croatian police attacked the first refugees on the Serbian border between Serbia and Croatia .
most originated media reports , according to Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came both by bus and tax@@ is to the Serbian Bor@@ der@@ stadt S@@ ID .
immediately after their arrival they had tried to walk across the green border to Croatia .
on the Croatian @-@ Serb border , the refugees don &apos;t meet refugees .
however , the cross strip must be other d@@ angers : there are currently sharp mines in the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s .
Min@@ e@@ dre@@ er should now establish a safe passage in a way .
according to Hungary , there are hardly any refugees after the closure of the border .
on Tuesday the police numbered 366 @-@ smo@@ ked people .
just before the closing of the Monday there were 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws stages the conqu@@ ering and damage to the mar@@ tial law as a criminal off@@ ense .
therefore 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the southern Hungary metrop@@ olis of Sz@@ eged .
the prisoners sentenced to five years old , and the deportation from the country .
according to the immig@@ ration authority I have made a total of 94 asylum applications on Tuesday to the border set in the bound@@ ary set , of which almost every - 93 - at the most important change of r@@ ös@@ ler .
among the applic@@ ants , 13 families with young children and two older people .
on Wednesday morning some 40 refugees have stopped .
practically , nobody has granted a view in Hungary for asylum in Hungary .
after un@@ inten@@ tional view , Serbia is a &quot; safe third country . &quot;
the past asylum seek@@ ers should be turned off there .
only a few hundred refugees came before the &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ one &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
workers began to rest in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke with him .
they raised the tr@@ ash , left the tens of thousands of people in the past few weeks .
locking lat@@ tices were dismant@@ led and one of the bu@@ ds in the border was rebuilt .
nobody wanted to express itself to the target of this modification .
Austria reached only a few refugees after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
in addition , the country has strengthened its border controls .
but around 20,000 migrants were still subject to governmental figures in the country .
in Salzburg about 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany .
the traffic from there to Germany was stopped by the German authorities in the morning .
in release , smaller groups of refugees met regularly .
Mayor of &quot; Gest@@ ures &quot; on the Border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were busy on Sunday with the premises when suddenly ten people were busy with trav@@ ellers at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ ern@@ st@@ one mayor of Alois Stad@@ ler &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to take the train to Pass@@ au .
because Germany was sur@@ pris@@ ingly sur@@ passed on Sunday , but because of the refugee &apos;s electricity by Austria , he was to conclu@@ de for them at W@@ ern@@ stein , who immediately offered his help and took the stack@@ ed together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars crossed over the border into the close of Pass@@ au .
prior to that , we have only ro@@ asted the un@@ hop@@ ed guests first , with lunch and drinks .
we said immediately , we bring them by car to Pass@@ au .
&quot; it was naturally &quot; for us , &quot; so Stad@@ ler in O@@ Ö@@ N conversation .
they were very grat@@ eful .
a man did not take it to receive a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; it pleased us very pleased , &quot; so Stad@@ ler .
the stran@@ ded cross train@@ ers took place on Sunday evening in Wels , from a ICE in a regional train to Pass@@ au , following the short notice that the railway traffic was discontinued after Germany but still attempts to try to reach the border .
the regional train was completed in front of the fron@@ tier in W@@ ern@@ stein at the Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stone , the border @-@ crossing is generally high in the course .
the bridge firmly bound with the Bavarian neighbours came on Sunday , before a two @-@ bridge sporty - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
Viktor Or@@ b@@ án now sends more forty thousand to us , is a logical result of a seem@@ ingly holy policy :
instead of the camp at R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke immediately after the erection of structures , our Federal Chancellor officially adopted and publicly presented the position of the Hungarian government into the Dun@@ ac@@ ne of National Soci@@ alism .
Lei@@ d@@ tra@@ des this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans , who are now con@@ fron@@ ted in the bound@@ aries with cha@@ otic states .
also the poultry thoughts need to be discovered that the &quot; gel@@ ew@@ ed Land , &quot; which she is invited and welcome , nothing was another refugee camp .
it will be a major challenge , in view of the continuing refugee flows and of the coming winter , we would manufacture human reasons for protective search .
and there will be one more greater - peace , safety and stability in Austria .
Konrad in search of 35,000 w@@ inter@@ fixed quartz
Konrad has filled all hands with the refugee community .
Christian Konrad is it used to have his word weight .
the government has used the earlier powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank in order to impos@@ e qu@@ ro@@ ls for thousands of refugees .
the chaos within the First Trade Centre of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already reached the man@@ ger in Konrad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we did no hom@@ eless more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he reported his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the accommodation of 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday were without great host , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad and pra@@ ising the organisation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the Ministry of the Interior expressed by a &quot; k@@ ris@@ ky situation . &quot;
the company projects a total of 85@@ ,000 quartz in the he@@ y year .
in order to meet the figure , 35,000 accommodations will be found in the next few weeks - 20.000 are supposed to deliver 15,000 of the federal states .
if there are more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the state capit@@ als he has already led up talks .
these would have promised him , to establish well for the forth@@ coming refugee camp .
&quot; in Upper Austria , it works well , &quot; said Ferry Mai@@ er .
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ ela supported Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christophe Schön@@ born , it should be clari@@ fied as the church will help .
great expectations improves the As@@ ylum Co@@ ordin@@ ator also in the ORF Action &quot; Hel@@ ps as we . &quot;
private individuals can offer free accommodations on the platform .
Moreover , one hope to hotels that are empty in winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ized the standards for accommodation as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in case of emergency it can &apos;t be that Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ ot must stick to a certain height of the towel @-@ holder or the size of the guard .
for temporary time it would have to apply &quot; emergency standards . &quot;
that , in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , &quot; Konrad Adenauer has been able to deliver his experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am an older gent@@ lem@@ an , who doesn &apos;t say without further into the face of the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
persu@@ asion is the most important weapon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and Mai@@ er cause the Republic to cause no costs as they declared themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
their number of employees want to increase their number on three to four .
the own book @-@ search was not yet successful yet .
Konrad wanted to set a container at the st@@ eph@@ an@@ splatz in the office .
but there are obviously problems with permission .
Linz calls for a better breakdown
there is no opening of urban sports@@ men and other buildings like tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for placing refugees on the city of Linz .
this is no longer necessary since the person concerned has not yet to accommodate these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lug@@ er ( SP ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the emergency they are to be tested for further locations on their Tau@@ opath@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
criticism of the city council to the allocation of the refugees within the federal state .
other districts have to aff@@ ord to this post .
Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er : &quot; the limits are not sealed &quot;
in a longer telephone calls with the Bavarian Minister of Horst Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , R@@ enti@@ er Josef P@@ du@@ inger ( VP ) has en@@ acted on Monday the further procedure for refugee in@@ quiries .
Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er has as@@ sures me that the German borders are not sealed .
a further study of refugees in the Federal Republic of Germany remains possible .
nevertheless there is just the respective border controls .
special trains with refugees in Germany I won &apos;t give it any more .
however , the protective search would however be brought to Germany with regular bre@@ wing .
from the other EU member states , P@@ touched by once more ampli@@ fied solidarity in the refugee question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the anticip@@ ation of the Germans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Austria can be introduced to its limits &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Austria . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next R@@ unt@@ astic is a matter of time
the General@@ bran@@ ce of the &quot; Neue Ship@@ yard &quot; in the Linz industrial parts is officially completed .
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT @-@ based IT @-@ Group B &amp; T , the rest ( 2700 square meters ) is to be hired to young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the IT the wise heads are our raw material - and we are trying to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T CEO Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could imagine to invest in start@@ up companies in the New Ship@@ yard and later also to celebrate .
already from the beginning on , S &amp; T wants to co@@ operate with the new neighbours - some of which promises are actually quite promises : &quot; the next R@@ unt@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
with a capacity of 1.7 million euros , S &amp; T invested in the location , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ center , which belongs to one @-@ third of the city of Linz , the Land Upper Austria and the federation ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is se@@ per@@ ed by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T as well as a Tech@@ center .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 30 per cent of the 2700 square meter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; floor space in the building are already rented , for a further 40 percent there are requests . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ ina opened second business in the ar@@ cade
in the new shop Fur@@ la @-@ Hand@@ bags are in the centre of the new shop .
actually Jutta Bre@@ it wanted to take a dog .
this project had to slide the 49 year old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni at the Tau@@ ben@@ Market @-@ Ark@@ ade . finally , it has now got an increase in the form of another business location .
in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop , in which they sells bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and garments of various manufacturers , all of them go to the vene@@ er brand Fur@@ la , Wall@@ ets are available from 75 Euros .
large bags and accessories costs up to 500 euros .
the new shop is in operation since yesterday .
in the first several weeks ago it was rebuilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have long left if I was still to open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Bre@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
decisive for the decision was among others that also the Fur@@ la @-@ producer , who are in Bologna at home , from the idea of an own site , where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only family in the big hall of Linz , who sell this stamp , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters , who made Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
your fashion interest has placed Bre@@ it by her mother in the cra@@ dle .
I da@@ w@@ ns most , if something is developing and I can show new trends at competitive prices .
why some woman when a beautiful hand@@ bag is in a trance , so also the specialist will not answer with the last security .
maybe it is clear that a beautiful bag is out@@ fit any out@@ fit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ etter from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pf@@ äl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from one place whose inhabitants are called as@@ her .
this property combines man@@ ders with the billi@@ on@@ aire that wants to become the US President .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is still fine .
whether he is ex@@ ag@@ ated in foreign host@@ ility , repor@@ ter Ru@@ bies or Not@@ with@@ al will be revealed in the international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential office is going to soli@@ di@@ ct the campaign for election campaign .
and cuts well .
this will also be registered in the pe@@ asant town of K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the property with billi@@ on@@ aire .
the New York with the &quot; Re@@ conc@@ fr@@ is@@ ur is a concept for many in the wine @-@ village on the wine road .
there is over -@@ only corners with him in the 1200 @-@ inhabit@@ ant place .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Palat@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election campaign mode .
the master of Simone Wen@@ del turned a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about his goal to become the world &apos;s most powerful man ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe that somehow the way is exciting , but in her k@@ ins@@ woman you are not so deeply impressed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ t made a am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous spro@@ uts , among which Tr@@ ump also belongs to the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
Tr@@ ump , who is not known for awareness , comes into &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) also to Word - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
and he didn &apos;t put it to the king of the hearts .
though it respect respect of the performance of the family , but also prog@@ ressing , think that Tr@@ ump &quot; is a little bit a big stone , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
acci@@ dental , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt within the radius , &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - is said to be said : the crowd , says it .
Tr@@ ump is thus coming from the village of An@@ onym .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 1885 when the later grandfather , and in the USA opened a local professor for gold dig@@ gers .
the foundation stone of the property company were first plot in New York .
but life of the grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their wish to return to their native country , failed on the Bavarian State , to which the Palat@@ inate was involved at that time .
he did not support Tr@@ ump , because he once had been cut off without homologation , the director of the Institute of Former History and Eth@@ no@@ graphy , Roland Paul , explained for film production .
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of a &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
it is in contrast to the coming statements of the follow .

Mr Dh@@ ak@@ al said the police have had tear gas , and then shot in the air before turning back to Gum@@ mer@@ com@@ ra@@ de .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not clear why the employed rubber mig@@ ra@@ ines , known from those well known that they can kill those who are traditionally used as a less dead@@ ly alternative , obviously they produced a high death rate .
the con@@ front@@ ation was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nep@@ als southern levels , where members of the ethnic group of Mad@@ h@@ esi say that new provinces , which are formed within the framework of the proposed new constitution , would decrease their political influence .
there were also protests in the western Nepal of the Th@@ arus &apos;s ethnic group to have their own state .

for easily over@@ sized diabet@@ ics , weight loss surgery can be helpful .
the benefits of weight loss sur@@ ge@@ ons for easily over@@ sized people with type 2 diabetes , may last for at least five years after a recent study .
it &apos;s still too early to say if indeed , overweight people with diabetes after weight loss sur@@ g@@ gy live longer than those who do not receive surgical treatments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mortality data require a long time to show something &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert for weight loss surgery , who wrote a mission article on the new study at Jam@@ ama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight loss medication or ob@@ ese surgery , use various methods to shr@@ ink the size of the stomach .
you reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s own ability to record food .
over the years , Adi@@ pos@@ itas sur@@ g@@ eries were used effectively for the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most of the studies have been carried out in people with a Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher .
BMI , a certain degree of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18@@ ,5 and 24,@@ 9 .
a BMI of 25 or greater indicates that someone is overweight , and people with a BMI over 30 are regarded as ob@@ ese .
you can calculate your BMI here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the study , researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which they have collected since 2007 in a study and compare two types of obes@@ ity - gast@@ ric ypass and stomach lining - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes that were slightly overweight .
the average BMI amongst those who underwent the operation decreased from 31 to 24@@ ,5 to the end of fifth year in this study .
the BMI of those who did not receive surgical diabetes treatment approximately equal to 29 .
among those who underwent surgical procedure , in case of 36 % of the diabetes condition dis@@ band@@ ed completely and at 28 % partially .
in the medical @-@ treated group , diabetes slow@@ ed fully in comparison with diabetes by only one percent and partly at only about two percent .
in addition , the results were obtained from controls in blood pressure , tri@@ glyc@@ eride and the &quot; poor &quot; LD@@ L cholesterol &quot; in general , the authors found out better .
the researchers monitored the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ) which reflects blood glucose levels throughout the time .
hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best described below 7 percent , write the researchers .
after surgery the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level decreased by around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
however , in the medical therapy group there remained stable at about 8 percent .
but this better &quot; glyc@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - how did you reflect in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - didn &apos;t reduce the mortality in five years , the researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also represents the average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the gast@@ ric rec@@ tom@@ y group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) and hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and had rather a complete over@@ coming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show survival benefit from the surgery after five years , there are indications of a study of serious people in Sweden , causing surgery to live longer life , Black@@ stone says of the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it was subjected to ob@@ ese people who underwent a Adi@@ pos@@ itas operation , about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group of conventional methods .
although the new study was no advantage of survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it is soo@@ thing for individuals with a BMI below 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation in the lower BMI group is lower , &quot; without an elevated risk of death or kidney disease , she said .
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should begin to take weight as soon as the patient lies with his BMI between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we waited too long until we bring people to take this serious , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think that once they have gathered these genetic changes , they have firmly connected their body with obes@@ ity and diabetes , a reverse version is really hard . &quot;

Europe could not accept all refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East .
the Tibetan Buddh@@ ist leaders res@@ ur@@ ged to qu@@ it violence in the countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama spoke the problem of the lasting refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten days visit in the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford which focuses on eth@@ ics studies .
it demanded that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be put before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of West European countries in the refugee crisis is ad@@ mi@@ red , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible to come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama &apos;s and Austria &apos;s efforts are lob@@ b@@ ying the crisis , he stressed that it is only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to worry about several thousand refugees , it is wonderful , but in the meantime , you need to think about long @-@ term solutions that can be created , mainly through education , for these Muslim lands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ultimately , we must think about how the killing in their countries is reduced .
we need to reduce power .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the application of violence has never solved these issues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama also said the problem of violence and commented on George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack of September 11 , and exhibited that the violent reaction of the US went a chain of un@@ controlled events after himself .
after September 11 , I expressed my side @-@ hand in a letter to President Bush and I said to him , the way to solve this problem is in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know , his moti@@ ves were good , but he put violence one , and that has unexpected consequences &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four@@ fold increase from taking of fire detection by children over the last 4 years
po@@ ison control centers in the United States have reported an almost 400 @-@ percent increase in number of children under the age of 12 , which swal@@ low a strong hand cra@@ ck , such as Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord L@@ op@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of Rev@@ e@@ alog@@ ues have reported for children under 12 years , showing po@@ ison control centers , from 3,@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; children are increasingly being used to these products , and unfortunately having a percentage of them go to the not@@ ion , &quot; said L@@ op@@ ez CN@@ N .
he said that some children are deliber@@ ately drunk stuck , while some of them do to im@@ press her friends or to im@@ press her friends for a mut@@ ation of the social media .
videos on YouTube show how young people of disinfect@@ ant drink only because of a budget action .
juven@@ iles have mixed their disinfect@@ ant with alcohol content to obtain inher@@ iting drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive de@@ formation of disinfect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; said L@@ op@@ ez .
many of the attractive ( hand disinfect@@ ant ) are those who are par@@ ked .
there are disinfect@@ ant with straw@@ berry , grapes and or@@ ang@@ es , who are very appe@@ aling for children .
the inf@@ ant sizes contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
particularly in small kin@@ ks , a few syr@@ inge can lead to alcohol po@@ is@@ oning .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; told Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , Medical Director of the Gi@@ ft@@ not@@ ation Center in the hospital at the University of Kansas , the Fox 4 in Kan@@ sa City .
so , you would release no si@@ p Whis@@ ky , but people let this hand @-@ disinfection in reach of children , and if children come to it then it &apos;s a quick way to consume much alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who recently taken four syr@@ inge after straw@@ berry du@@ ck inf@@ ant clothing at school was brought to a treatment for treatment .
their blood @-@ alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold that has been en@@ dr@@ unken with an adult law said Dr. Chris R@@ it@@ ch@@ ey , a emergency doctor , who treated them in the G@@ win@@ dy Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah caught up her words and was not able to go in , when she arrived in the not@@ ion .
doctors super@@ vised it overnight in a separate children &apos;s disease at the signs of Hir@@ n @-@ Trau@@ ma , since the girl had fallen by the alcohol and had fallen off the head , R@@ it@@ ch@@ ey said .
&quot; it was very sensitive , &quot; said Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ ahu &apos;s mother , CN@@ N .
it would have been fatal for my child .
L@@ op@@ ez has parents and teachers recommended to use non @-@ alcoholic products or disinfection products outside the range of the child .
some alcohol po@@ is@@ oning were connected with death cases .
in 2013 , two women died in Ontario women after the swal@@ lowing of hill@@ sides , which ab@@ stain@@ ed a toxic , un@@ declared access .
employees of health authorities suppose that the product contained me@@ thanol , a dead@@ ly solution instead of ethylene alcohol that was recorded as an active ingredient .
in January planned three students of the fourth class in the State of New York decided to hal@@ ve their &quot; common &quot; teacher , having anti@@ bacterial products around the class@@ room , &quot; says a police report .
the teacher is extremely gra@@ ined , allergic against hanging , and named it from her space .
the police concerned the failed plan as &quot; so@@ w@@ ät@@ z &quot; and demonstrated the inter@@ disciplinary measures to the school authority .

Griff@@ i@@ ths plays a speech through Dish@@ on@@ mon@@ y
there are rum@@ ors of dis@@ cord at Cel@@ tic Glasgow , which was rejected by Griff@@ i@@ ths spont@@ ane@@ ously . this insi@@ sted that he and his team mates are not under elevated control , as they prepare for the con@@ front@@ ation with the Dutch championship guide .
I don &apos;t believe we will feel under pressure , I think that the players are looking forward to it .
the lack of title competition in Scottish football @-@ bo@@ red Dutch - de Bo@@ er
former rank@@ ings and former national players of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch fans have lost interest to Cel@@ tic , there will be no title Ri@@ val@@ ry with the leaderboard .
de Bo@@ er , currently a ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; in Holland , they show no highlights of Cel@@ tic games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the rank@@ ings are not there .
people don &apos;t just talk about the return of the leaderboard .
talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
they speak for both teams and this is what they should be interested .
there is a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and there are not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn the things around , swe@@ ars D@@ eil@@ a .
R@@ onn@@ y D@@ eil@@ a accepts that Cel@@ tic battle has to fight , but the Norwegian boss had to turn these things .
after the defeat against Malmö and the subsequent retirement from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 men from Aberdeen , who now have five points advantage is clear at the head of the table .
D@@ eil@@ a said : &quot; Cel@@ tic had already bad times , and we will come back . &quot;
now we want to come back as soon as possible .
I know , it &apos;s very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or g@@ rie@@ ve over what happens .
we feel that - but we will go on .
we really need , really the support of Cel@@ tic , because it makes the player better .
now it is important to get together .
War@@ bur@@ ton c@@ auti@@ ous in January transfers
despite his comments prior to a couple of weeks ago , the leaderboard &apos;s boss Mark War@@ bur@@ ton will be careful in signing up with the signing of new additions , so that he wants to inter@@ rupt the unit of the I@@ bro@@ x @-@ Ka@@ ders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ex @-@ boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January transfer window is very different from the summer window &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
players who come in summer have this pre@@ season period to in@@ corporate what you have seen with our own group in this season .
the crew is really good .
sometimes more damage is done by adding un@@ necessary player to add what you really need .

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged while rising in the UK .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 , during the period of May to July 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without working for the United Kingdom grew by 10.000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
the unemployment rate of 5.9 percent was above the U@@ K@@ s of 5.5 per cent , such as the figures of the local statistics for National Statistics ( for the ONS ) .
in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12,000 .
the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent during the first quarter - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
state Secretary for Scotland , Ed@@ ally commented on the latest numbers and said : &quot; the long @-@ term plan of government has laid the foundations for a stronger economy . &quot;
it is almost exactly a year ago that Scotland has taken the historic decision to stay part of the United Kingdom .
in these 12 months , we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment .

why I will be in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
a little later , except for a late legal intervention , I will look to see how a man becomes death .
when it happens , and I hope it will not be done , I will sit in an audience @-@ gallery at O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is executed by the tox@@ ins .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death .
the invitation already took place in January for the first time in January , and although I was sho@@ cked , I voted to vote .
when the day closer , I began to fear me .
so , why should I do it ?
I agree with it because I thought it would be a good opportunity to tell the entire story about the death penalty .
it would provide a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists may see exec@@ utions in the United States , and there are often more applications available than their seats , a ma@@ i lot@@ tery is taking place to decide who is chosen .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media pitches from 12 to five .
those who are selected will be observed emotional .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard Glos@@ s@@ ps close friend , with whom I developed my own relationship over the months with telephone data and a 2 ½ hour visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh often , when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and pen that I see what I see .
I just have to try to remind me of all details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me of sending me on Twitter my dis@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of men how he wants it and you will get access .
I compl@@ ain about her .
she dre@@ amed , &quot; it could have been better form@@ ulate , &quot; but they always think that it &apos;s wrong , what I do .
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I would not do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he may remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants to be an international repor@@ ter in order to write there .
when he dies , He keeps the public relation of movement against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a repor@@ ter of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit beside me .
if you want to know more about the case , please hear the series of po@@ d@@ casts that I have made .
I don &apos;t want to go down here again to all details .
I can &apos;t say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his acts after the assassination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would not take him to be a favorable relationship .
but I believe that there is a strong chance that he is not guilty of murder .
I think there is not enough evidence to justi@@ fy a death sentence .
I think that his execution is false .
and from this perspective I will see him die .
I can not claim , really obj@@ ectively to be .
there will be other repor@@ ter that you can use for it .
what you will get from me is what it means to die another death .
man after mo@@ ist police pursu@@ ing tra@@ d to come from the C@@ anning river
the C@@ anning V@@ ale polic@@ eman remained dry when he spoke out of the C@@ anning River .
an attempt by a man of Perth , which was to release the police , was un@@ successful when he was found in the s@@ wer@@ ed and sw@@ amp@@ al water just a few meters from a police officer , who tried to talk gently to the shore . &quot;
the police in C@@ anning V@@ ale was rec@@ alled on Tuesday to a home peace break @-@ incident in Beck@@ er@@ am .
when they discovered the susp@@ ects , this one tried to escape from the direction of C@@ anning river .
but he did not come too far .
&quot; he stood in the water , and said &apos; I come not out , come and hol , &quot; said Senior ser@@ ge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ le@@ dine .
Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too excited to make his uniform wet , therefore he turned to a more reliable tac@@ tic , &quot; A good employer is negoti@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said Senior ser@@ ge@@ ant Cast@@ le@@ dine .
championship football player Ben Cou@@ pling provides an unforgettable example .
in 2006 , cou@@ sins drove his car to the tr@@ ench to escape from alcohol control and then tried to swim over the Swan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful , but inspired nati@@ ves to the hum@@ orous planning of a Ben Cou@@ bine bi@@ athlon .
Peter Moody claims that st@@ ew@@ ards tried to express him and threatened to end racing
Peter Moody claims that the st@@ ew@@ ards of racing Victoria re@@ tries to install a sp@@ y in its st@@ ables in one year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he participated in the st@@ ew@@ ards and the integrity division of Racing Victoria and claimed that she led a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate Sc@@ rat@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai , because of a race day treatment , the last current of Stro@@ h@@ hal@@ m on Wednesday .
Moody &apos;s said Fair@@ fax Media that he has always tried to do that which is best for racing , and he himself found himself under difficult conditions as it went about the positive co@@ b@@ alt tick control at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain .
he held back for 18 months because of the sp@@ y @-@ alleg@@ ations and did not want to see that it &quot; looked like high @-@ end grapes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say anything to say , and I have made long to eat , but sometimes you are so fru@@ str@@ ated that everything goes out again &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Moody . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that there was so far .
sometimes you re@@ acts , and I have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with that which I said .
I will go home today and sleep well .
I want to make a high head , and I want to think that my owner think that I try my best to try .
if they begin to think , I do not do that , then I should be no more trainer .
I should remember , what I do with my license .
prior to that , Moody &apos;s sales advanced the bomb during an interview with rac@@ et@@ ing.com that the integration department had tried to express his stable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eigh@@ teen months , Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart in a room with a man - whom I will ren@@ ame , and if I do want to do something about what I do in my st@@ ables , we said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moody on Rac@@ ing.com . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they apparently believe that I am a che@@ at .
if that is the case , they could surely cap@@ tiv@@ ate to her n@@ oses , because they have failed to grip me with the attempt to hold me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , eh@@ em . President of Route L , David Moo@@ die , acting president of Route L and Bernard Sa@@ w , current CEO of Route L , were aware of the time and today it is still alive today .
should I bring it to the view that it is personal ?
has the RV@@ L meet and makes people responsible for what is responsible in the branch ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think out that I am it .
maybe they have to take my license and re@@ ject me and I have no doubt that what I say they are thinking about it now .
but I am now at the point that it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad .
that makes me really sad .
I will ex@@ ert the pressure on it and push them up to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the fru@@ str@@ ations @-@ levels of train@@ ers have established themselves with the long @-@ lasting co@@ b@@ alt examination of Li@@ dar@@ i and the L@@ ate Sc@@ rat@@ ching had said that he could bring his license to the table . &quot;
Moody , best known for his preparation of the invisible master@@ ers Black C@@ avi@@ ar , awarded the race @-@ treatment rule , &quot; ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous , &quot; after a package sl@@ ud@@ ge or tone was carried on the horse &apos;s chariots , winning against the rules .
&quot; it is against the rules of racing sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to assume the full responsibility &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my staff gave ir@@ rig@@ ged sl@@ ud@@ ge onto the leg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could be the evening that night .
it could be the whole day yesterday so that which was so .
but it was also so on the race day .
Moody &apos;s could con@@ fron@@ ted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the package at the racing day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set these rules do not know about the horse .
&quot; we all see what we need rules , but here one went too far , &quot; said Moody .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy strikes against Ring@@ ing against Ri@@ vals for claims
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has critic@@ ized criticism of the Tac@@ gen@@ ic player as &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; from two Premier League favorites the N@@ RL .
Sydney Roo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson announced that the arbit@@ rators will have allowed the Storm game to compete in the qualifying finals in Sydney on Friday night during the High Storm winning champion in Sydney on Friday night .
Brisbane Bron@@ co Trainer Wayne Bennett made a little closer look at the Storm team , after his team had reached the Final win against North Que@@ ens@@ land C@@ ow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; pattern &quot; at the Rug@@ by League , and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land does not want to be &quot; well &quot; in the rings .
Bell@@ amy def@@ ended the t@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his team and said that she is only concentr@@ ating in tac@@ kling on their &quot; Contact &quot; .
Bell@@ amy added that the cr@@ iti@@ que of two leaders in his team agree with him that they might be wor@@ ried that they should be wor@@ ried by the Storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is back on - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson have ro@@ cking on ring@@ ing , as they struck us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we have changed all year round of our def@@ ensive system or techniques . however , in the last six weeks we have made our contact with tac@@ kl@@ es to a real balance , and that has produced the turn@@ around for us .
Tr@@ ent is now for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . he &apos;s probably not to lose himself , so it was a bit a shock for him .
it is already funny , as it dives again in this season .
Bell@@ amy has bombar@@ ded the idea of the &quot; exciting soccer &quot; and his ment@@ or reminds that Benn@@ et@@ St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; long @-@ whe@@ eled &quot; soccer .
Wayne speaks of exciting soccer .
he came up his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting her game was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy .
I remember that in 2010 St George became an experienced team , and Wayne made that he will take care of a partition .
but now he has a team that can play and which we have as an exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
that &apos;s the ball game that you want to play if you have this type of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not each team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt , so that they can play them like this .
I develop stronger faith because they say these things because they are a bit about to play against us .
six weeks ago they did not think about us when it went around the Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also proved that the Storm Storm against Roo@@ sters have increased higher result than the game Bron@@ co against C@@ ow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ co was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t considered it , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two further trials in our game , but is that an exciting game ?
or are breaks and no points of sp@@ iting ?
it is the sched@@ ules for me .
when they mention it , it means that we will meet again in one phase .
the Storm team will be vac@@ ated at this weekend as they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land C@@ ow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks at the semi@@ finals in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales will begin tomorrow morning .
Serbia with 200.000 $ deposit of don@@ or
a man , possibly a li@@ fel@@ ong sentence is threat@@ ening due to its success in the possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , which were beaten up after Que@@ ens@@ land , was released a deposit of $ 200,000 .
Marko Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men who arrested the last month after the police seized 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay that came from South America to V@@ anu@@ at@@ u and in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed , as he was his co @-@ def@@ endants in the marina in the morning and later at the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite a whole life sentence for an attempt to have a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , argu@@ ed the attor@@ ney of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic that there was no evidence that he attempted to own the entire amount and that in the café could have been a harm@@ less reason .
judges at the Supreme Court of Justice , Peter P@@ agan was concerned about the threat of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic .
he has clear relationships with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he declared the court on Wednesday .
in the case of the prosecution , he lied upon the police on his position .
Mak@@ si@@ mov@@ &apos;s mother and boots had offered a b@@ ail of $ 200,000 back on security in order to reach its release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the stated explanations of the two people it is clear that the circulation of a value of $ 200,000 represents a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said judges Flan@@ agan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this alone will not be sufficient to stop him out , war@@ ned .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released on b@@ ail , under the terms that he returns to his Australian and his Serb Pass at the police daily and stops at a starting block from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .

J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell is de@@ cent of human body
the Federal Constitutional Court rendered an ex @-@ mate to the prison by the Federal Constitutional Court of Te@@ gel , which lived for monthly in one of the small cell .
because of the violation of human dig@@ nity , prisoners are generally eligible for financial compensation if they are in to small cells .
this decision has decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision on Wednesday .
according to the judges , the judges can even hope for money , if they were imprisoned only a few days in close rooms ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus , an ex @-@ det@@ ain@@ ling with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe . he was accommodated in a single cell with about five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was completely isolated .
after that , the man , who had been moved according to his property , has now been found on the free foot in a large cell .
his jail liability stipul@@ ates due to the un@@ worthy liability conditions against the Land Berlin in particular .
however , the Constitutional Court over@@ took the judgment of the chamber decision in Berlin and re@@ affir@@ med the case for the re @-@ trial .
they don &apos;t see the man &apos;s dig@@ nity .
chamber of chamber decides about the amount of the compensation
even if out of legal reasons , only a few days of adhesive for the compensation are decisive , be a compensation was given , it was called .
otherwise &quot; a mut@@ il@@ v@@ ature of the legal protection of personality is &quot; fear . &quot;
the chamber of chamber now has to clear the height of the money .
the constitutional rec@@ ti@@ fier have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past already .
this did not say then in April to in@@ mate an in@@ mate , because he was in@@ car@@ cer@@ ated naked in the cell .
human dig@@ nity is a decision from 2011 and the multi@@ ples of one cell without separate toilet .
in addition , in addition , on Wednesday , the Berlin Constitutional Court , a prisoner in a parallel event , confirmed a de@@ cent accommodation in a parallel event in November 2009 .
the Prosec@@ ution was over three months away from 15 to 21 hours a day in a similar cell , like the Karlsruhe @-@ Karlsruhe .
the Berlin pris@@ ons had come in head@@ lines for the last weeks due to lack of personal staff .
the cap@@ tives will therefore always be shut down again for 23 hours , while the aggressi@@ vity is rising , it should be at the cl@@ amped position because of the cl@@ amped situation .
according to the alignment of Justice , 21 places in Te@@ gel were not occupied for young children , 19 should fall in 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the Refu@@ gee Agency : &quot; we are creating the &quot;
the immig@@ ration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Federal Chancellor is determined to accept them .
what comes to Germany ?
approximately 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany according to forecasts from the German Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs , according to the statement by Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , and Germany is able to under@@ take a million refugees .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) demonstrates in view of the unusual challenge : &quot; I say again and again : we can do this , and we can do it . &quot;
what comes to Germany gives you the following overview :
according to various forecasts , according to various forecasts , between 3@@ 50000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of the Federal Ministry ) and 400,000 ( estimate of the Pest@@ el Institute ) apartments annually , and for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as build ( 25@@ 0000 apartments ) .
the lack of living space is especially due to affordable accommodation : 600 to 800@@ 00 social spaces are out of the rental price , and in order to apply these special @-@ priced apartments , people will apply to refugees .
Federal Minister for the Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) , therefore , wants to double the amount of € 518 million to a billion euros .
a lot too little is this out of the view of the Pest@@ el Institute : 80 000 social dwellings would have to be developed annually , and this has to be investing a funding in the amount of 6.4 billion per year .
in fact , scientists and the Federal Minister for Resi@@ dential , agree that there must also be more tax advantages to investment in residential buildings .
according to estimates of the Institute for Employment Research and professional research , 55 percent of the fully @-@ fle@@ dged employment in Germany can be employed .
however , refugees in Germany were no longer necessary after their qualification to help them with the introduction , Claudia Walter , Project Manager for Integration and Education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann @-@ Stiftung .
however , for the integration of refugees , it is decisive if they find in Germany .
work is the key for social contacts , for the appreci@@ ation in the admission region , but also for the self @-@ est@@ e@@ em of migrants , says Mig@@ r@@ ations@@ for@@ scher Dietrich Thr@@ en@@ hardt .
in Germany , according to the Thr@@ en@@ hardt there has been a political shift : the for@@ b@@ ance of refugees for the recognition of work .
while it had previously been a working ban for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as resi@@ den@@ ying to asylum seek@@ ers to a subur@@ b .
in society - also because of the professionals , the pro@@ vision@@ ally under@@ stands that refugees to be able to improve access to the labour market as well .
a big hur@@ dle for access to the labour market are missing German .
until now there is no out@@ sour@@ ced offer of general and occupational language courses .
in addition , studies will also demonstrate that jobs will be convey@@ ed by personal contact .
the structure of networks is therefore suitable for the integration process after view of Thr@@ en@@ hardt at the König@@ s@@ weg .
the Berlin School Administration has found that only few ham@@ mer@@ ed their children in the Kit@@ as , estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the un@@ designed parents , &quot; Il@@ ja Ko@@ sch@@ bar , spokes@@ man for Youth and Family in the Berlin Senate department .
to win the family from the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration of Hand@@ s was removed in different languages .
if the need to rise strong by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase educational capacities by the Berlin Senate , appro@@ ving more technical colle@@ ges .
students without a German only welcome groups are prepared for lessons in the following countries .
but they are not always taught of fully trained teachers and teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have one qualification in German as a second language .
there is no lack of evidence , Be@@ ate St@@ alian from the Berlin administration administration .
the German student union estimates that some 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany .
in principle , not a federal state of asylum seek@@ ers or contra@@ dic@@ ated the study - the only exception was Berlin , the Ac@@ ens@@ en@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CDU ) has now abandoned its position .
study for refugees may be facilit@@ ated by the university education institution .
because refugees with a residence permit or Dul@@ ce has no performances in accordance with the asylum seek@@ er laws more when they begin studying .
the latter is generally not B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , since they fall not under the circle of the b@@ af@@ els .
the plaque to have had been living in Germany up to four years in Germany to be eligible for B@@ af@@ ö@@ g @-@ entit@@ les , from 1 January 2016 to 15 months .
this financing gap must also be concluded , Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin State Secretary for Science , and the German Student Union .
the students should immediately get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
Islam will continue to play a major role in the future , because many refugees are Muslims , and many of them is the religion important part of their identity .
the state should have succ@@ essive the same rights to Islam , as they have churches , and the existing state @-@ churches right to develop a new state @-@ religi@@ ons .
it is also important that the establishment of a Islamic char@@ ist that assi@@ sts in profession@@ ally around the new@@ com@@ ers .
the obligations include duties .
so , the representatives of Islam must be clean at clean contacts and prepared to work with the state in many areas and to rest some control possibilities .
this also includes the read@@ iness to approach against religious fundament@@ alism .
the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , ou@@ sted on Thursday the wor@@ ried , religious conflicts could also be entered in Germany .
those who wanted to blow such conflicts in Germany have immediately left their right to stay in Germany , in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk .
he proposed to translate the Basic Law on an Arab Republic .
integration will now be much more than today a topic of all society .
in order to change the majority society , the degra@@ dation of discrimination and rac@@ ism will also op@@ t .
Germany indeed has - as a result of European decisions - as a result of a decade following a decade of anti @-@ discrimination and a General Gender Equality Act .
but it gets very slowly , like the NSU @-@ M@@ ord@@ series , in which police and authorities igno@@ red the rac@@ ist motive .
equal opportunities for all : what migran@@ t organizations and the advoc@@ acy groups non @-@ white German already ask for long , and why international agreements need to be reality in the next few years if the country will remain peace@@ fully and citizens to benefit from their new citizens - for the sole of all .
generally , Germany is able to medi@@ cally care to the previously expected refugees , President Frank Ulrich Mont@@ gom@@ ery means .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what man@@ - Power and Capacities affects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the daily level . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however extra money must flow into the system .
to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ gom@@ ery , all of our links to the health of healthcare .
the services could be calculated later with the Länder .
and long @-@ term , it is highly frag@@ ile worthy to remove so many people with the limited power catalog , which see the asylum seek@@ er laws .
otherwise , doctors do not make all the language barri@@ ers .
as early as Berlin , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has been demonstrated , migrants will be reflected in their diseases than other patients .
not only in clinics , also in medical practices , you will need to charge your interpre@@ ting .
many refugees have also been helped with more general medical centers in the emergency @-@ ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
in any refugee children approximately there are considerably more untreated disabilities , and with the young people you go about HIV @-@ En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment .
with the partial diseases of disease , German doctors came from her vocational training but clearly stated in Mont@@ gom@@ ery .
&quot; paras@@ ite in@@ fest@@ ation or tuber@@ culosis are not so difficult to know . &quot; and what the medical angel aff@@ righ@@ tly relate , with the refugees , even a relief in sight .
the Syrians had developed a highly developed educational system , and some refugees were even physi@@ cians .
however , in order to be pract@@ ised , however , it would have to prove their qualification and re@@ mot@@ ely ex@@ hum@@ ed once again .
at least half of the refugees coming in Germany is sick according to estimates by the Federal psycho@@ therapeu@@ ath ( B@@ Pt@@ K ) , most of them suffer from post@@ trau@@ matic injuries or de@@ pres@@ sions .
in particular , he &apos;s refugee children , says Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ Pt@@ 1000 .
a recent study by TU Munich has recently shown that every 5th Syrian refugee camps take refuge in Germany .
those who are suffering from a post@@ trau@@ matic case disorder is suffering , among other things , in the so @-@ called Flash@@ back with respiratory floods , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart @-@ n@@ oses and death .
other symptoms are sleep and concentr@@ ating disorders , severe hur@@ ri@@ dity and emotional car@@ nau@@ ght@@ iness .
in order to prevent the symptoms of chronic cancer , early therapy was necessary , declared mun@@ z .
however , only four percent of psych@@ ic sick people get psycho@@ therapy .
although psych@@ ic sick people can put an application for psycho@@ therapy in the social offices , the treatment usually lasts for several months .
in addition , mostly non @-@ skilled workers or doctors who are not trained in the psych@@ ic disorders , would not decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this lead often to mis@@ ass@@ ess@@ ments , says Mun@@ z .

for more than 33 years the Circus is in the hands of the family Pro@@ bst .
thus the gift for the inspir@@ ing family is in the blood .
&quot; we are important to take away the people from their daily routine and to bring them to another world for two hours , emphas@@ ises the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Jun@@ e@@ ef@@ in .

&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; emphas@@ ises Steph@@ an@@ ies &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
mis@@ er@@ ors in the attitude of circulation are only too often with various animal protection organisations .
Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst also takes position : &quot; it is not good for our animals , that we are not well pleased . &quot;
approximately 80 animals from five different continents enjoying every string of string .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quad@@ ri@@ ot Arti@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as it is lov@@ ingly called , will be read from the eyes after all the wish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to collabor@@ ate with animals and have fun with them .
does the animal feel like that , it will not be in the Man@@ ege .
so the top commandment is : good for the animals .
especially on its zeb@@ ro@@ id jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land@@ Pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ age and a zeb@@ ra @-@ mare , the family is pro@@ ud@@ ly pro@@ ud@@ ly .

although the zeb@@ ro@@ id is not ready for the Man@@ ege , but this is the unique mas@@ cot of Circus Pro@@ bst .
so there should be something for each visitor .

Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard presents up to 30,000 jobs
the Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard plans to produce 25.000 to 30,000 jobs within the restructuring and saving efforts at the company &apos;s services .
hp will split up this year in two listed companies and split computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and its service activities .
the expected job loss results in a burden of over $ 2.7 billion from the fourth quarter , HP said in a statement .
&quot; this restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , sustainable supplement for the new Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard Enterprise enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chair@@ woman and Chief Executive , which should guide the unity after the separation .
&quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise is smaller and stronger than it &apos;s HP today , and we have a wide range of shops that support company in transition to a new style of business , &quot; Whit@@ man said .
as an independent company we are better than ever before to satisfy the changing requirements of our customers around the world .
Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise has more than € 50 billion annual turnover and will be focused on providing sustainable technology solutions for businesses , &quot; such a declaration of the company .
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hew@@ lett and Dave Packard , to manufacture electric plants and whose Palo Alto Garage you called &quot; the birth place of Sil@@ icon Valley . &quot;
HP has a solid re@@ struc@@ ting to handle the return from traditional PCs to mobile devices .

ar@@ senal &apos;s captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team mates remain behind the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
W@@ enger is stressed by Wil@@ sh@@ ere it is only September and if rehabilitation after plan goes , there is no reason why he cannot play himself before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will be sure to miss at least the next four games for England and in view of its history , his participation in the next summer is certainly uns@@ af@@ e .
the big dis@@ grace of this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere finished the last season after a separate Kn@@ u@@ ck@@ el@@ age and then back to its old swing back in the pre@@ season .
&quot; this type of injury does not trigger the career &apos; , said W@@ enger .
it is a bone not healed .
this is no greater matter .
this was just an accident .
it was not in combination with its Kn@@ u@@ ck@@ les or with the injuries , which he had before .
this may be true from pure medical view , but as W@@ enger also approved , there is the corresponding risk of other injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it develops also an un@@ pleasant pattern .
the examination of Prime In@@ j@@ uries Ltd lists 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of Ar@@ sen@@ as 157 Lig@@ as@@ games in the last five days of play .
the wider picture for Arsenal is that it has been in six of eight game times since 2007 / 08 one of the two Premier League clubs where most vulner@@ able days have to be recorded .
W@@ enger accepts the potential of a devil &apos;s reaction , however , ar@@ senal believes that an improvement in the injuries ratio will continue during the last season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , if you return from an injury , you have a vulner@@ able period , a time to strengthen your body and combat strength , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
jack is young enough to overcome it .
I hope that his body stabil@@ izes , I &apos;m confident that he will do it and he will get a career of the art that he deserv@@ es .
Arsenal begins his Champions League @-@ season on Wednesday evening towards Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games on Saturday and to Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ track the coming Wednesday , and W@@ enger illustrates a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ connector Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not travelled to Croatia , meaning that Math@@ ieu Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are not able to start .
W@@ enger can also begin with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ ro@@ ud instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to maintain the balance and the players who need to capture a small blu@@ epr@@ int , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Arsenal are clear favour@@ ites , by group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the largest insertion effect in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games , after the &quot; un@@ defeated &quot; campaign was launched last season .
the stadium was sh@@ aken by a earthquake that was measured on the Richter scale 3.2 .
this year it was 10th in Zagreb .
W@@ enger is the opinion that Arsenal has moved out of the past season with the Champions League surrender to Monaco and remains driven by far hope , with his management also lead the association to his first European cup triumph .
&quot; this pro@@ pulsion is immen@@ sely , &quot; said W@@ enger .
it has never been folded for ar@@ senal .
we were very close in 2006 , but on the other side I am long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious but we are not dre@@ am@@ aged .

in 2013 it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and there are three times more common in men than women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Campaign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ l ( CA@@ LM ) announced in 2015 as a year of man to ask the culture in question that men seek to seek help if they need this .
friendship is the heart of the heart in order to master this challenge .
a recent study with over 2,000 high @-@ school students with de@@ pres@@ sive symptoms revealed that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficient high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; its opportunities would have doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , hal@@ ved a circle of spiritu@@ ally healthy friends the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to get friends only once to work for a friendship .
in the age of over social media communication , with its focus on style on substance , the in@@ sol@@ itude of the answer is often more important than an important contact .
our digital life have the need to be strong , fun and successfully to appear , even if in reality the isolation is dominated .
this su@@ perf@@ icial success is dominated by the domin@@ ating the psych@@ ologists ex@@ tr@@ ins@@ ic values , money , image , social status , all at cost in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner lon@@ ging desire for personal development and friendship , which works much more deeply about our spiritual health .
and like a video game invent@@ ors and billi@@ on@@ aire , recently explained , money can really buy .
the beauty of friends was that they focus on the head .
each character has not been defined by his work , but by its personality by the interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ or of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler frequent U@@ mar@@ es , Mom@@ ents when the football matches in cozy bo@@ ilers and the lon@@ ging of Ross to Rachel - all this came from knowing that men can refer to everyone , even though they often hold back to explore completely their feelings .
as a worker in telephone calls it declared to me : ... &quot; my ro@@ g@@ ation for people who feel de@@ pressed and end@@ anger@@ ed , really showed me how to make a difference even the smallest inter@@ actions of friends . &quot;
the men who contact us feel often not in the position to talk with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old phr@@ ase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has a tremendous impact , as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if you speak openly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to me in the sense when I try to offer long @-@ term evaluation mechanisms .
it exhibits quite clearly the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
so very my obj@@ ector out@@ sider status via telephone the human being in eyel@@ ash look . the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so if you come to this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the celebration of the day completely redesigned setting , why do not take your friends at a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better when you &apos;re sitting in Star@@ bu@@ cks anyone alone , give it a smile and say hello .
you never know what the difference could make your friendship .
friends will be broadcast at Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the entire 236 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
how to Av@@ oi@@ ries Maria to M@@ ute PS@@ G , Malmö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ i@@ di and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani according to his hits on Malmö .
di Maria meets his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and help PS@@ G to Malmö in Malmö .
here are the game report and the response to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held course as Paris Saint @-@ Germain gave his Champions League &apos;s season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malmö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park stadium on Tuesday .
di Maria hit less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League Deb@@ ü@@ ts as PS@@ G player , who brought the French masters on their way , but afterwards missed it a number of opportunities before they finally achieved their lead as Cav@@ ani in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Sch@@ acht@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A , Paris also requires a strong start against the Swedish champion , since it is not only the qualification for the K.@@ O@@ .-@@ Tr@@ ash , but an improvement on the way to the quarter final in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , there was no class game of Laurent Blan@@ cs Team with Z@@ lat@@ in Ibra@@ him@@ ov@@ ics missed opportunity to play against his home town team and against the club , with which he already started his lively career back in 1999 .
&quot; it is not easy to win at home or back@@ wards in the Champions League . so , it &apos;s a good start , 2 : 0 to cause our opponents to cause and relaxing , even if there are certain things we have to finish in the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; this is a good sign . &quot;
we wanted to win and we &apos;ve won , though I regre@@ t@@ ted that we did not have one or two more gates . &quot;
Ibra@@ him@@ ovic returned to Paris team after his injury in the Paris team which was holding a 2 : 2 draw on its own place against Bordeaux in the first League , but he was cast out in the fourth minute through Di Maria .
the Argentin@@ ian barn was named as the man who was taken over to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over in the last month of Manchester United , and he interpreted in the last month of the Malmö Defense , before he was passing away by Johan Wil@@ and in a long corner of the multilingual network .
but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , it was disappointed .
Malmö , the Cel@@ tic in a Play @-@ off left to reach this level , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was excited with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field , an har@@ sh opponent .
but apart from a shot by Nikola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who went far to Kevin &apos;s tips on 34@@ th minute , they sail a little in the attack .
instead , the PS@@ G himself had sometimes on , with some mis@@ sil@@ es and bad degrees , not least did by Ibra@@ him@@ ovic , who had been patent in no less than five trials alone in the first half and then abandoned after being used after the re@@ boot .
nevertheless , he pointed out much more that when he brought his players into the game , and it was a pass of Ibra@@ him@@ ovic , which Di Mary was related to a shooting which was directed by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the pole .
the second gate was finally arrived shortly after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ ans had thus his sixth season open@@ er , after Ibra@@ him@@ ovic had captured a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
that ended all thoughts that Malmö could come back into the game , and only an outstanding intervention of Wil@@ and from shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz was able to keep the final result before dis@@ embar@@ k E@@ ze@@ qui@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi a gate at the end .
the coach of Malmö , age har@@ ei@@ de , gave later that PS@@ G played a class on his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was in December last year .
since then we played only in the Swedish League , which did not have the same level .
the qualification games are not enough . &quot;
hat from before Paris !
it was a great game of them !

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean , it is amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than 10,000 $ or to life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac e ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
as quite suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed faced with The Hollywood repor@@ ter to discuss the finale and why British , though he finished first ever to the course , did not receive any prize money .
on the rules the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; if there are more than one fin@@ alists , the one receives the fastest time , &quot; said We@@ ed .
as very the money is a wonderful prize and life changing , he gets the great gr@@ ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think that he swe@@ at about it .
he is just so happy to have done what he did .
he received many fans at the masses .
he is so a great guy and a family .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
Ge@@ off said to me , &apos; If I should be sm@@ itten by someone , then I &apos;m glad that Isaac is Isaac . &quot;
and I think that Isaac had felt so bad if it had inserted the roles .

Detroit Tig@@ ers swe@@ eps to Minnesota Twin@@ s
MIN@@ OX@@ ID L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not very fun for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
earlier , they were once one of the best teams in bas@@ eball . today the Tig@@ ers stand on the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played on Tuesday perfect against Minnesota Twin@@ s with 5 @-@ 4 in the Target Field .
the Twin@@ s got a chance for the rise in the frame of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card @-@ Platz .
for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letters F @-@ Word , which was so difficult to contain over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all victories do have fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad P@@ er .
tiger pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon held early offensive support , when Detroit installed three times in the first two inn@@ ings , once in the sixth and then once again in ninth place .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) struck 6 times in the 1 / 3 inner ings and made three edges .
it was not his third succ@@ es@@ ful start into his last nine games .
&quot; I want to end this year , &quot; said Simon .
it is difficult to throw in the bul@@ l@@ ubs of each game , and therefore I will be very concentrated in the game .
the designated Tiger @-@ H@@ itters Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two edges , his first R@@ BI@@ s since the mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ hit @-@ play of Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against the Seattle Navy on July 6 .
&quot; he has melted the head@@ wood , &quot; he said .
he looked good at ( stroke training ) , looked much better from the bul@@ l@@ ubs , and it brought them directly into the game .
the Twin@@ s got their best chance to come back into the game with three rings at the end of the 7th att@@ ing .
center F@@ iel@@ der Byron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the In@@ ning with a double in the left @-@ line .
right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks reached a bun@@ ch , and Simon brought his second bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to the Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the Bla@@ ine Hard@@ y Hard@@ y Bay .
Hard@@ y over@@ ran ag@@ wall , the only man faced with whom he was con@@ fron@@ ted before the designated ro@@ ok@@ ie gr@@ ati@@ man Miguel S@@ ano who was designed to create a Two @-@ Run with the designed Dre@@ w Ver@@ h@@ agen .
with a pair of runners and the finish run at the second , Ver@@ h@@ agen entered the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe at Double Play .
it was that in the Major League leading 27th time in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ chers hit a Double play
after Detroit came to the bottom of the ninth place , the wall added a R@@ B@@ I double towards the C@@ loser of Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the status of 5 @-@ 4 .
but the right @-@ handed is S@@ ano with three pit@@ ches for its fifth Save .
Detroit benef@@ ited from the start of the game by an even more moving Phil Hug@@ hes .
the tiger was captured by us in the first two bars against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , which was yesterday in front of the injuries by the physical list after being missed out more than one month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously not the beginning I was desired , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hug@@ hes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt happ@@ ier when I started and felt that I would make some good Pit@@ ches I would create in the third inning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after first received the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter , H@@ ush@@ es received a single at Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ ret .
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought by Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to the game , who made a single &quot; up the middle &quot; during the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z abolished his 0 @-@ 21 successful series with the lap in the Scor@@ ing Position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos with a single at the right hand , managed a further run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was cast out of the game , as he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat .
the tig@@ ers laid on the second one for one @-@ out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single von Center @-@ F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose to the 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; it was a great blow , &quot; said Twin@@ s manager Paul Mol@@ itor .
he didn &apos;t beat any especially well , but he did know the right spot .
Hug@@ hes found herself in a pitch @-@ Count , and achieved no points in the third inning , before he was replaced by the Reli@@ ant Office A.@@ J.@@ A@@ id . Hug@@ hes .
the Hug@@ hes came to us with six hits and one walk with four strips .
note : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP An@@ i@@ bal San@@ chez expired after a violation of the root ap@@ ologi@@ ans .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who operated the shoulder from San@@ chez in 2007 .
San@@ chez , since the middle of August on the injury list because of a shoulder @-@ break , it should be activated for the start on wed@@ n@@ esday .
with San@@ chez from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris is cancelled by the vulner@@ ability to start the Twin@@ s .

no diet fruit - Mang@@ os contain plenty of sugar
Mang@@ os are exotic and ju@@ icy cute .
but he who wants to pay attention to its stream@@ lined line , the one will often go down from them .
for Mang@@ os contain relatively much sugar - especially Sac@@ char@@ ose .
the exotic fruit can still be healthy : in them B vitamins and the vitamins E and C. We contain many vitamin A and vitamin A and its pre@@ amplifier beta @-@ Carot@@ ene .
whoever e@@ ats the fruits so supports vit@@ ality , immune system and met@@ abolic processes in the body .
when buying , Mang@@ os should not be too soft or hard to be hard and pleasant .
the shift color alone does not say anything about how ripe fruit is - so also our green man@@ go is delicious .
you should sit down at room temperature and be consumed within few days .
then they taste pure or in sweet foods .
there is also a man@@ go , but there is a special note .
you mild the slightly bitter taste of herbs as ch@@ illi and Radi@@ c@@ cio .
and a man@@ gan@@ ese goes well to fish , poultry , lamb , and wild animals .

Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther Square
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is a Martin @-@ Luther Square .
in the presence of City President Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino has been christ@@ ened on Wednesday an un@@ nam@@ eless place in the park on the Opp@@ io hill on the name of the German reform@@ ator .
at the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; he now acts as a &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation &quot; .
the park lies in the middle of the old Rome right next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was lodged in Rome by the work community of the Lutheran churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , priest of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome , rec@@ alled that the Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es were often living in the bor@@ ough of their faith in the city of the Pop@@ es for centuries .
in symbolic terms , the tradition of the Christian faith are welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) held a couple of months in Rome for the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 .
he felt the city back then as a sin b@@ able .
its negative impressions did the impact of the hist@@ ori@@ ans in his late struggle against Rome in his later struggle against Rome .
then Luther was then initiated with its thes@@ es against the destruction of the derived church .
hammer Artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gilded ) Dor@@ n@@ enk@@ rone wast@@ es is one of the main units made by the Ot@@ mar Alt for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and Bible tex@@ as .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which now appeared with splendid pictures .
at the beginning , the image for Ot@@ mar Alt , who has formulated his own personal interpre@@ tations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 moti@@ fs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative shapes has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - which is not far equ@@ ated with &quot; funny &quot; images . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : adapted topics can work quite well .
for three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his bi@@ ble project for which he met a sub@@ jective and artistic selection from the many topics of the book of all books . &quot;
these are cycles that focus on topics such as causes of cross@@ roads , pl@@ agues , commandments or pat@@ ern@@ ity .
as a result , he has informed spont@@ ane@@ ously several partners : this is the same way for the Luther &apos;s publishing house with its the@@ ological focus , as well as for the Kettler publishing house with its emphasis on artistic books .
and there is especially the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who described themselves on the basis of painting with the particular Bible verses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he interpreted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interpreted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Ot@@ mar Alt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and translated so into today , in current lin@@ king . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like For@@ ced Mir@@ ror of Al@@ ts Painting .
embedded in between the original bi@@ ble itat by Martin Luther and one movement of the artist , who formulated his personal thoughts about the situation here .
the jew@@ ellery cave has golden let@@ tering .
thus the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high degree of in@@ tim@@ acy .
emotions , in general , were the medi@@ ator for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born 1940 in W@@ ern@@ ig@@ er@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family who belonged to the strict Protestant Herr@@ n@@ hu@@ ter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was an up@@ bringing audience with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pipe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; is remin@@ is@@ cent of Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to compos@@ e that , in order to bear me again with the Lord Father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to restore the art in faster time again to more opportunities : &quot; the perception of image what has been imp@@ acted by Rek@@ l@@ ame , and he is no@@ isy .
symbol@@ ism is ur@@ ged here .
artists have a different desire and desire to show things .
images always have some mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in that respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wants us to let down the viewer in the pictures &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can , discover and feel which force they have : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the image is looking for his face . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost began on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; for ever &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts art has been to be art : &quot; I like he under@@ stands with his paintings . &quot;
I don &apos;t aff@@ ord the Bible to capture the Bible , but also selected the mysterious topics for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a collaboration at eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here it is about the images , the text explains only &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from Luther &apos;s publishing house this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life in deep@@ en and freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler for both the ( biblical ) language of love than also those of responsibility .
a part of the original paper - and sheet wall paintings - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition , which will be opened on 15 November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung .
start of construction for BM@@ X railway
plans were made , place found , company set up , war@@ fare for a circuit : one year later , almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X there was over .
fail@@ ures in politics and administration ensured for a halt , especially in the residents who wanted to be patient .
so hil@@ locks , new place are looking for - now with formal planning and application for building permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the approval will go down in October , the First General Assembly among Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bock has now been able to leave in the chil@@ dr@@ ens and youth committee . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I hope that this year was still visible , &quot; said it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further commem@@ oration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the work at the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B strongly intensi@@ fied commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees from 2003 to 2019 , and the Bundesliga was a significant sign on the weekend .
the football respon@@ ds to the inv@@ iting situation in Germany and ensures that politics impos@@ ing its help with the lack of any problem .
&quot; I &apos;m responsible for the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no one to say in principle , that &apos;s nothing , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it has to be interested in every one of you who have to get a grip on the handle , &quot; says DF@@ B boss Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach .
on 23 September , at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel , he wants to intensi@@ fy the refugee situation in Germany .
&quot; I am next Wednesday at the Chancell@@ ery and meet there the Minister for Minister H@@ zo@@ ğ@@ uz and the Chancellor . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will be a central role for sure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the football can also help .
however , the decisive turn@@ outs have to place the policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German Football Association has therefore extended its refugee policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Stiftung we ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained kidney s@@ bach at the edge of the UEFA meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also some states support this program .
already this weekend , the 36 pro@@ fi@@ is@@ an impos@@ e a clear sign when it comes to the left Tri@@ k@@ ot@@ era instead of the usual sponsor@@ ship logos ( Hermes ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make clear that everyone and how they can only agree , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen Sport@@ ster Rud@@ i Völ@@ ler from the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; image &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Self @-@ sensitivity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refugee &apos;s drama goes every man , nobody can see it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we may know S@@ occ@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to ut@@ ili@@ ze our g@@ um , our influence and our possibilities to help many refugees who have already suffered so incredible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Managing Director of Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent role in the league . &quot;
to the EM @-@ qualification round for Hungary on this Friday the national team of the women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Saale .
Nier@@ s@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; a large community of German football . &quot;
in fact , that all 36 sp@@ lic@@ ts have started their own projects in their own projects , be great .
just as great is that small and smallest clubs are active there .
the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome , &quot; which we spent is going to live in football .
&quot; it is of enormous importance , &quot; he said .
this and the next year the association will jointly serve with the DF@@ B selection and the Federal Government for 300 000 Euro each for the integration of refugees .
&quot; the clubs have already rec@@ alled the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; reported R@@ s@@ bach .

according to CEO of Europe &apos;s largest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , according to several reports , report@@ edly lost the left eye by a fall of July .
following the accident on the steps of his brother &apos;s house in the USA he dropped to midnight on a water glass that he had carried in the left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; it is almost ble@@ ed , and was dying to the road - that he told us a last week . &quot; he quotes the &quot; W@@ IW@@ O &quot; SAP @-@ co @-@ founder Has@@ so Plat@@ ner .
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t can go after his work .
&quot; at the beginning of October , we meet in front of the Supervisory Board in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; says Plat@@ ner .

Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer time he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
it is important to be so important with such a personal history to the public , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; said : &quot; everyone can happen so . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s important to re@@ prove if you please . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Foot@@ wear : Bv@@ B without re@@ us against Kras@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the gate
in Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us will be defeated in the first group of the Europe League .
the national player will be missing the table leader of the soccer league in the du@@ el with the FK Kras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.00 / Sky ) .
&quot; we can not count on him , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if Re@@ us will be on Sunday in the Bundesliga match against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the Bv@@ K @-@ Coach opened : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect a return of him to the workout on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of the high stress of its professionals , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change its stem to the Re@@ us position only .
so he qu@@ it a change to the door@@ ke@@ epers .
this is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes place the place of dom@@ art@@ ender Roman ush@@ ki .
&quot; he trained at an absolute top level , &quot; the soccer @-@ teacher praised the World Champion .
if the body@@ work in the future is used in all of Europe &apos;s League @-@ Games , Tu@@ ch@@ el made open .
with a high probability , it will also contest the second game .
the forced statement of Mit@@ ch Re@@ us that the fin@@ al@@ ment for the Bv@@ C in the Europe League will be the goal of completing the mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian W@@ eig@@ l for a re@@ trac@@ table : &quot; that &apos;s not that Marco is not so wrong . &quot;

Robot@@ er@@ au@@ tos : government wants a pione@@ ering role in Germany
in Germany , according to the will of the Federal Government , Germany is expected to be changing the technological incident at the same time .
on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Transport Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which provides for an investment in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
Do@@ brin@@ dt said on Wednesday , in Frankfurt , at the edge of the Autom@@ ate International at the IAA of a &quot; new Mobil@@ ization Age . &quot;
the automated driving and networked driving will increase the traffic safety and provide less cuts , Do@@ brin@@ dt said .
he also wants to discuss the topic with its counter@@ part of the G7 states , which at the IAA also came together with representatives of the industry .
the &quot; Ministry of the Transport of Transport , emphas@@ ises the importance of the mobile Broad@@ band expansion and a high @-@ level switch to digital radio stations .
testing of new technique is currently taking a test track on express@@ way 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks are set up , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shall the Federal Government review the legal framework &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and , where necessary to adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result , Germany wants to keep the maximum permissible speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars from 10 to 130 km / h .
Moreover , the Federal Government plans to set up an amendment to the Vienna Convention which so far only provides people as a driver .
when automated driving takes over in increasing measures the driver , the driver gets more and more to passenger .
the technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that process the environment and process data in seconds .
based on an economic report , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways will be technically possible until 2020 .
in spite of this , movable vehicles on public roads would be expected to be expected shortly after 2020 . &quot;
the value added in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the Germany location will estimate the authors of the study by 2025 at about 8.4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of the car can lead to more safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD Transport S@@ ör@@ en Bart@@ ol &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability in accidents and security of the personal data of the drivers must be clari@@ fied clearly .
however , the Germans self @-@ prop@@ elled cars are sk@@ ep@@ tical - much more than the French or Americans .
one on Wednesday , at the AA pre@@ set survey of the For@@ sa Institute in order to prove that only eight percent of the Germans believe that autonomous cars will prevail in the next ten years , 32 percent expect only 20 years to believe , 31 percent believe not at all .
in France , 21 per cent of those surveyed admitted by 2025 with autonomous cars , accounting for 33 percent .
in Germany , drivers are not ready to rely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
after a survey of the Digital S@@ IT@@ KO@@ M choice , only seven percent would agree to control the control during the entire trip on all roads .
on the fre@@ eway we could introduce a 15 percent increase in flowing traffic , and 45 percent in St@@ au .
well , everyone was able to leave the control under no circumstances .

Gaul@@ tier feels too old for a enf@@ ant .
it is a mixture of very large mo@@ ist style and a juni@@ per @-@ mo@@ ist chair : the designer Jean Paul Gaul@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on Wednesday in Munich on his work .
the highlights : display man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins , which can look similar to video proj@@ ections according to video proj@@ ections .
they carry out the spectacular cre@@ ations of the French designer , which has been out@@ fit the stage out@@ fits with Mad@@ onn@@ as to the big star of the fashion scene - and therefore that he burned males in rolls .
&quot; I can no longer say that I &apos;m the fishing called the Haute Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; earlier it was hard , but it &apos;s real , &quot; said Gaul@@ tier .
for visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the pav@@ ement to the cat@@ walks ) , who is to see from September 18 at the Kunsth@@ alle of the h@@ yp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is a fortun@@ ate that the Mod@@ eller Maker has changed its original rental position to a vision of his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually , he was on the other side , because he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me a bit after death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when men die , you get to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously done previously in Montreal , Canada and Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is tolerance , acceptance and vision of open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the hard work of the man who has written fashion history without having completed a training .
chron@@ ologically the show is not built , but it is an excellent , chore@@ ograph@@ ically total artwork , designed for much effort : to prevent pupp@@ ets , for example , a styl@@ ist is engaged .
14 tons of material have er@@ red the makers by the Kur@@ ators Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich .
shortly before the Oktober@@ fest@@ es in October there was a special treat : a leather p@@ ants out@@ fit with cor@@ dial .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is always interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are swal@@ low as men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , &quot; Gaul@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Gaul@@ ti@@ ers old Teddy is shown in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , z@@ ag@@ ic complex testing of the designer .
as a kid ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) , having clothed his Teddy B@@ HS and clothes , Gaul@@ tier had said .
to play with a doll , his parents would not allowed him to be allowed him .
later the dis@@ card of fashion then brought it to himself .
he st@@ ole fashion signatures and saw the designs of other designers , like Gaul@@ tier in Munich .
later I bought it , of course .
for his first own mo@@ at review , he did not pay the models .
they received nothing , but they were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewelry instead of Gard@@ ine - Pl@@ au@@ ener tip as fashion n@@ ical
it was so@@ ck earlier on the long wings of nitrogen in and to pl@@ ank you about it .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and tips were created in large amounts for customers that worked for example to ceilings and curtains .
today it does not work anymore , Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the Mo@@ ors sit places .
instead the fashion is important .
in the early times of Pl@@ au@@ ric top , fashion played a bigger role , then pushed out by the home textiles industry , and is now being discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt lists some examples : top of jewelry , for accessories such as bags and regional trains .
in all , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which re@@ jects an over@@ burden of sty@@ li@@ ances , is an increasing client potential .
those who are not able to use in the textile industry in Germany is no longer available on the market .
we already make half of all the orders already .
Mo@@ ve seats Pl@@ auen , together with nine other companies member of the industry association Pl@@ au@@ ener tip and embroi@@ der@@ ies .
only they can bear the protected label .
in the last 15 years , about 80 percent of its turnover is taken away .
private shops and also the wholesale there is almost no more .
our products reach the customer hardly in this way .
the mass products are often manufactured in the Asian region much cheaper and almost exclusively distributed via chains .
they are also weaker , currently to Russia and the United States .
sufficient reasons so for new ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association also tried to score environmental awareness , such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer by the embroi@@ der@@ y in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since this year we have a quality seal that shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and soci@@ ally distributed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; it is also the way to the materials used . &quot;
designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches the University of Applied Art at the University of Applied Art , at the University of Applied Arts , Germany , at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and speci@@ alis@@ es in embroi@@ der@@ ies and tips .

EU wants to double mercury limit value in pir@@ ates
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large cat@@ fish , and consumption compar@@ es much higher dose of ner@@ ve gifts .
the F@@ ood@@ watch , a corresponding plan of the EU , is critic@@ ized the plans sharp : &quot; risks and side @-@ related concepts are continued with full force of balance and infants , &quot; stated Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch .
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nerv@@ ous region should be lifted for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as ha@@ ik@@ - or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish from &quot; economic reasons &quot; by one of two milli@@ grams of mercury .
large Rau@@ b@@ fish are however still strongly loaded with mercury that the limits of force limits are not sold at the limits of force limits that may not be sold at the current limit values of 50 per cent .
only 14.5 percent would then be dis@@ cour@@ te@@ ous after double the limit values .
in contrast to the F@@ ood@@ watch , the EU wants to watch the limit values in other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram .
F@@ ood@@ watch , however , called &quot; Tri@@ ck , &quot; because smaller Fried@@ y@@ fish , like approximately carrots usually stressed as low , indicates the planned maximum values already today .
the lowering of failure is therefore &quot; a per@@ fi@@ able de@@ fle@@ ction man@@ oeu@@ vre that helps the economy alone , &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt .
mercury is a heavy metal heavy metal , which is above all in the food @-@ fish , especially in caves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government therefore war@@ ns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no small amounts are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may cause small damage to the nerv@@ ous system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Ministry of Environment declared its website with respect to the maximum allow@@ ances , but that a &quot; health concern of the general population was not expected . &quot;
mercury is performed especially through the coal combustion inside the environment .
according to a written informations by the Federal Ministry of Environment , the Federal Ministry of Environment ordered more than six metric tons of mercury in the year , two thirds of those in Germany em@@ itted total amount .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish around the river Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanent and widespread end &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the mirror &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had been quoted from paper in March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , in Europe wide war@@ nings before mercury in fish already related to the most frequently reported health risks in the EU @-@ warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
