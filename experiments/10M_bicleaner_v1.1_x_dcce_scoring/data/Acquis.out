if a re@@ agen@@ z is used in the manufacturer recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena may not occur : a ) h@@ amm@@ ol@@ y@@ tic properties ;
the title is measured by always renewed di@@ lution of the agent to double the double in a suitable medium .
the title is the recipro@@ cal value of the number of strongest Ser@@ um@@ di@@ lution , in which a reaction occurs ; the di@@ lution is calculated exclusively of the volume of blood cells in the total volume .
in anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents required to be used in object carrier , the activity is expressed through time that is necessary for ag@@ glut@@ ination on a object carrier .
the World Health Organization has set up for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents for the blood @-@ group@@ ing international standards , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity are elabor@@ ated at the time standards .
a International standard standard contains according to definition a certain number of domestic units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the titles which are observed in individual preparations red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of the re@@ agents for the blood @-@ group@@ ment of most specific@@ ity is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ ally , which is observed in a series of di@@ lution at a er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ tic floo@@ ding .
the title gives the di@@ lution of the re@@ agents in the last mixture within a series where a microsc@@ op@@ ic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effectiveness of the re@@ agents for the blood @-@ group@@ ings are available ( currently anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the title of the unknown re@@ agents in International units ( See Bulletin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 3@@ 01 . ) .

if a re@@ agent under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its required characteristics should remain at least one year long .
the expiry date of a re@@ agent in the essi@@ mis@@ ger form according to label is at most one year after the last satisfactory activity test .
the expiry date of the label for dry re@@ agents depends on the results of the holding tests ; it is driven by the state supervisory authorities .
dry re@@ agents are kept in an atmosphere of in@@ able gas or in a vacuum , and in the glass container , where they have been dried and which can be locked so that no humidity can penetrate .
a dry re@@ agent may lose most 0.5 B.@@ C. his weight if it is tested by further drying on phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ ine oxide in a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm H@@ g within 24 hours .
to prevent bacterial growth , the responsible state authority can determine that the re@@ agen@@ z ( or the used with the dry re@@ agents supplied ) is an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic used , provided the re@@ agents with the added substance continue to be the requirements for specific@@ ity and effectiveness .

the re@@ agents , equal , whether in a p@@ essi@@ mis@@ tic form or after re @-@ resolution , must be transparent and may contain neither sedi@@ ments nor yellow or visible particles .
the re@@ agents required for international exchanges and re@@ agents should not be colored arti@@ f@@ ici@@ ally , at least as long as not until an International Convention on a uniform system has come about .
re@@ agents for the en@@ rol@@ ment are spread in such a manner and in such quantities that the re@@ agents are located not only to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control cells .
the quantity located in a container have to be so big that the content may be used if necessary to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer of producer has over all production levels and controls of re@@ agents to lead to the blood @-@ group@@ ing written records .
appropriate samples of all re@@ agents have been kept so long from the laboratory of a laboratory to keep up with some probability that the batch is no longer used .
the re@@ agents used for the re@@ agents are included in human , animal , herbal ( or mineral ) origin ; some of them represent the effective proportion , the others are the necessary means for strengthening the effectiveness and maintaining the stability of the agent .
for technical reasons these re@@ agents are divided according to the origin of their effective share in three groups .
this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain solely substances of human origin , or that animal or herbal re@@ agents can contain no substances of human origin .
on each individual container is a black on white printed label in English and French language to attach the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
4 . the amount or , at dried re@@ agents , the quantity and composition of the liquid required fluid ,
moreover , this label or the label on the box where the individual containers are , or the following information included : 1 . full name and address of the manufacturer ,
