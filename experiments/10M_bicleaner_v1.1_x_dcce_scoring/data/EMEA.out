this document is a summary of the European Public Appe@@ al report ( E@@ PA@@ R ) , which explains how the studies performed for human therapeutic products ( CH@@ MP ) has made studies in order to get recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
if you need further information about your disease or its treatment , please read the package price ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
for more information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg mel@@ ting tab@@ let@@ ins ( tablets that dis@@ solve in the mouth ) , as a solution for inser@@ tion ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. wir@@ res thinking and speech , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or sight of things that are not present ) , distr@@ ust and mad@@ ness ; • Bi@@ er @-@ I @-@ disorder , a psychological disorder in which the patients man@@ ic episodes ( periods of ab@@ normal m@@ ite ) alter@@ nat@@ ely with periods of normal mood .
Abi@@ li@@ fy will be applied to the treatment of severe up to severe man@@ ic episodes and the prevention of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past .
the inj@@ ecting solution is used for rapid control of gest@@ ated anxiety or behavi@@ oral disorders , if the oral intake of the medication is not possible .
in both diseases the solution can be used or the mel@@ ting tab@@ let@@ es can be used in patients with the swal@@ lowing of tablets difficulty .
in patients who are taking different medicines at the same time , the same as Abi@@ li@@ fy , the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be adapted .
this affects the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable communication of nerve cells to each other .
Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ yl@@ benzene probably works mainly as a &quot; partial Ag@@ onist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ otonin ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pel@@ ie like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine and dop@@ amine , but in a lesser degree as the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters has to enable the recept@@ ors to activate .
because D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine plays a role in schizophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ anist contributes to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , causing psycho@@ tic or man@@ ic symptoms and their re@@ occur is prevented .
the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy , the re@@ occur of symptoms , was examined in three trials over up to one year .
the effectiveness of the inj@@ ecting solution was compared in two studies in 8@@ 05 patients with schizophren@@ ia or similar diseases caused by a reduced un@@ rest over a period of two hours with a placebo .
in another study , Abi@@ li@@ fy about twelve weeks at 3@@ 47 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , in another study the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo that re@@ occur in 160 patients , in which the man@@ ic symptoms were already stabili@@ zed with Abi@@ li@@ fy .
the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy inj@@ ecting solution was compared in a study of 3@@ 01 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , which suffered from gest@@ ed un@@ rest , compared to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psycho@@ tic ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the change in symptoms of patients were investigated using a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who speak on the treatment .
the company also carried out studies in order to investigate how the body absor@@ bing the mel@@ ting tab@@ let@@ ins and the solution to decrease .
in both studies with the inj@@ ecting solution showed patients who were Abi@@ li@@ fy in doses of 5,@@ 25 mg , 9,@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms of increased anxiety than the patients , which received a placebo .
in the application for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder decreased Abi@@ li@@ fy in four of the five short @-@ term studies man@@ ic symptoms more effective than placebo .
Abi@@ li@@ fy also prevented more effective up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo the re@@ occur man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and when it was additionally administered to an existing treatment .
Abi@@ li@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses reduced also more effective than placebo the symptoms of imp@@ aired anxiety and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy for inser@@ tion ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extr@@ ap@@ yr@@ mi@@ tig@@ al interference ( un@@ controlled freezing ) , nu@@ is@@ ence ( sol@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ) , fatigue , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ never ( sle@@ eve ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Human@@ itarian Therap@@ y ( CH@@ MP ) to conclude that the advantages of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schizophren@@ ia and from moderate to severe man@@ ic episode in the treatment of schizophren@@ ia and in which the man@@ ic episodes spoke on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ ben@@ zo@@ le , to outw@@ ei@@ gh the risks .
in addition , the committee came to the result that the advantages of inj@@ ecting solution during fast control of gest@@ ational un@@ rest and behavi@@ oral disorders in patients with schizophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ia @-@ I @-@ disorder when a oral therapy is not suitable to outw@@ ei@@ gh the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission presented the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceu@@ tical Europe Ltd . a permit for inclusion of Abi@@ li@@ fy throughout the European Union .
A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y is for the treatment of moderate to heavy man@@ ic episodes of the bi@@ z @-@ I@@ - disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pel@@ vic languages ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once every day regardless of meals .
increased effectiveness at dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dosage for A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or com@@ bin@@ ation therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the effectiveness of A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y in the treatment of schizophren@@ ia and bee @-@ disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initi@@ al@@ dose should be considered when clinical factors justify this ( see section 4.4 ) .
if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ induc@@ tor is set out of the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pel@@ vic dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) .
the appearance of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psycho@@ tic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders , and in some cases reported after the beginning or after the change of an anti @-@ psycho@@ tic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ anist ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results of a epidemi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder , there was no increase of su@@ icide risks with Ari@@ pi@@ pel@@ ines compared to other anti@@ psycho@@ tics .
Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ yl@@ benzene should be applied with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular diseases ( M@@ yo@@ k@@ ard@@ in@@ color@@ ectal diseases , conditions , which are pre@@ disp@@ ens@@ ed for hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( de@@ hydr@@ ation drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ak@@ zel@@ eri@@ ous and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) .

if in case of one with A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y treated patients signs and symptoms of a Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ in@@ i@@ esis , should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment .
when a patient develops signs and symptoms which pointed to a m@@ ns , or un@@ clear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psycho@@ tics , including A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y .
therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ ises should be used in patients with scrat@@ ching cases in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese or in states that are associated with scrat@@ ches .

however , there was in one of these studies , a study with Fi@@ x@@ er dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the bond for und@@ es@@ irable cereb@@ ral events with Ari@@ pi@@ ben@@ zo@@ le patients .
hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with K@@ eto@@ azi@@ ebo@@ x or hyper@@ os@@ mel@@ ar@@ em Kom@@ a or death , was reported in patients who were treated with atyp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic agents , including A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y .
there are no precise risk assessment of hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia @-@ related unwanted events with A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic medication @-@ treated patients , which allow direct compar@@ isons .
polycarbonate , poly@@ ph@@ ony , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in terms of wor@@ sen@@ ing of glu@@ cose levels .
a weight gain is generally observed in schizophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar identi@@ ties , the application of anti@@ psycho@@ tics in which weight gain is observed as a side @-@ effect , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle is observed and could lead to severe complications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ yl@@ benzene in the central @-@ consciousness system , caution is advisable when Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ yl@@ benzene in combination with alcohol or other central efficient medicines with themselves over@@ sized side effects as se@@ dation is taken ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
the H@@ 2 @-@ ant@@ agonist Fam@@ o@@ ti@@ din , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ tion rate of Ari@@ pi@@ hip , but this effect is however not relevant as clin@@ ically .
in a clinical study with healthy pro@@ ban@@ ds increased a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( Ch@@ ini@@ din ) the AU@@ C by Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ yl@@ ons by 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , like flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , similar effects have and therefore should be made similar dos@@ ages .
at C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ isi@@ er , the common application can result in high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors from C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma @-@ concentr@@ ations of Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ yl@@ ons compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sible Met@@ abol@@ isi@@ ans .
if you consider the common gift of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other high @-@ effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors to A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y , the potential benefits should predomin@@ ate the potential risks to the patient .
other high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors from C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and HIV prototyp@@ ing inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dos@@ ages reductions .
after setting the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors the dosage should be raised by A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y on the dos@@ ages prior to the accompanying therapy .
Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 will be administered together with A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y , can be calculated with a moderate increase in the Ari@@ pi@@ ke concentr@@ ations .
in clinical studies showed cans of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pr@@ yl@@ ons per day no significant effect on the met@@ abolic ism of the sub@@ str@@ ates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ ine on / 3 Metho@@ ds ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ ine ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ yl@@ ons ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ ine ) .
the patient should be advised to notify your doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ anist .
due to the insufficient data base for the safety of humans and due to the concerns relating to humans , this medicine may not be applied in pregnancy , unless the potential benefits jus@@ ti@@ fies the potential risk for the fo@@ etus .
however , as with other anti@@ psycho@@ tics the patients should be warned of dangerous machines , including multi @-@ vehicles , until they are sure that Ari@@ pi@@ pel@@ ie has no negative influence on them .
the following side effects occurred more often ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than on placebo or have been classified as possible medical @-@ related side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of the side @-@ side effects is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schizophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study over 52 weeks joined in patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ yl@@ benzene , a total of lower incidence ( 25@@ ,@@ 8 % ) of EPS including par@@ c@@ is@@ ie , ac@@ ol@@ ony and dy@@ sk@@ in@@ i@@ esis , compared to patients who were treated with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .

in the long @-@ time period of over 26 weeks at a placebo @-@ controlled trial the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pr@@ ero@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo @-@ treated patients .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pel@@ vic and placebo where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ in@@ em@@ ed controlled laboratory switches appeared , yiel@@ ded no medi@@ cally significant differences .
enhancements of CP@@ K ( Kre@@ atin @-@ phosph@@ ate kin@@ ase ) , generally temporarily and as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients with Ari@@ pi@@ se@@ zo@@ le patients , compared to 2,@@ 0 % of patients treated with placebo @-@ treated patients .
at the side @-@ side effects that may occur in connection with an anti @-@ psycho@@ tic therapy , and above their appearance also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ yl@@ benzene , the mal@@ ign@@ ne neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , sp@@ ät@@ eb@@ u@@ cul@@ ary events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
in clinical studies and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or inten@@ tional over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pel@@ vic were observed alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death succession .
although there is no information on the effectiveness of a her@@ edi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ anist ; however , it is unlikely that ha@@ il@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose of benefits is , since Ari@@ pi@@ pel@@ ie has a high level of plasma .
it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ yl@@ benzene in schizophren@@ ia and Bi@@ er @-@ I @-@ disorder on the combination of a particip@@ ative effect on D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and Ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ - recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recept@@ ors convey@@ s .

in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1.@@ 228 schizophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed Ari@@ pi@@ pel@@ yl@@ benzene in comparison to placebo a statisti@@ cally significant increase of psycho@@ tic symptoms .
in a Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol @-@ controlled trial , 52 % of the share of Res@@ p@@ onder patients , who reported a response to the study media , in both groups similar ( Ari@@ pi@@ pel@@ vic 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measuring scales , which were defined as secondary studio , including PAN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery As@@ berg@@ - depress@@ ants scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study about 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schizophren@@ ia showed a significantly higher reduction of the return rate that was at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pel@@ vic Group and 57 % under placebo .
in an O@@ lanz@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study in schizophren@@ ia about 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients occurred and significantly less patients reached a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the output ( i.e. an increase of at least 5 kg at an average weight of ca .

at Ari@@ pi@@ anist there are no differences in the pharmaceuticals between male and female healthy pro@@ ban@@ den , as demonstrated by a pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic investigation of schizophren@@ ic patients no gender @-@ dependent effects .
a @-@ specific evaluation for Pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tics yiel@@ ded no reference to clin@@ ically significant differences in ethnic affili@@ ation or the impact of smoking on the pharmaceuticals of Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ yl@@ benzene .
the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ yl@@ benzene and Deh@@ y@@ dro @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ anist were similar in patients with severe kidney failure in comparison to young healthy pro@@ ban@@ den .
a single dose study on pro@@ ban@@ den with different eng@@ ul@@ um liver cir@@ rh@@ osis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the impair@@ ment of the liver function of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ yl@@ benzene and Deh@@ y@@ dro @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ ping , but the study comprised only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis of class C , which does not suff@@ ice to draw conclusions on their met@@ abolic capacity .
based on conventional studies on security tox@@ ic@@ ology , toxicity in repeti@@ tive casting , re@@ producing sto@@ x@@ icity , Gen@@ oto@@ x@@ icity and to the can@@ o@@ genic potential , the pre@@ clinical data left no particular dangers to humans .
To@@ xi@@ k@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in doses or ex@@ positions , which exceed the maximum dosage or exposure to humans , so they have limited or no importance for clinical use .
the effects changed a dos@@ ages dependent side @-@ dependence ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pigment @-@ accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended max@@ al@@ d@@ osis ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended Maxim@@ al@@ d@@ osis ( AU@@ C ) and an increase in secondary school rin@@ al @-@ car@@ cin@@ oma and car@@ cin@@ oma ( AU@@ C ) at 60 mg / kg / day ( the 10@@ fold of the Middle Ste@@ ady state @-@ exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose of people ) .

the effectiveness of abra@@ x@@ ane was examined in a main study , attended the 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which approximately three quarters had received an Anth@@ racycl@@ ine .
the effect of abra@@ x@@ ane ( in all of the hub or as a mon@@ otherapy ) was compared to that of a conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medicines ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
total languages spoken in the main Study 72 ( 31 % ) of 2@@ 29 with abra@@ x@@ ane treated patients on the treatment compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients who received conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medicines .
considering only the patients were treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer , there were no difference between medicines as well as to the deterioration of the disease and survival .
on the other hand , in patients who had received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer , in relation to these indicators that abra@@ sive more effective than conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was included .
it may also not be used in patients , the breast@@ feeding or before the beginning of the treatment low Neut@@ ral phil@@ en@@ Pay in the blood .
the Committee for Human@@ itarian Met@@ als ( CH@@ MP ) fixed that taking the first treatment no longer suggests , more effective than conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medicines was and that it has to be given in contrast to other P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medicines not with other medicines to reduce side effects .
January 2008 , the European Commission appointed to the company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited a permit for the in@@ traffic of abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union .
abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ mon@@ otherapy is indic@@ ative for the treatment of metastatic breast @-@ car@@ cin@@ oma in patients with which the first @-@ line treatment is failed for metastatic disease and for which a standard anth@@ racycl@@ ine contained therapy is not displayed ( see also section 4.4 ) .

in sen@@ sor@@ ic Neurop@@ ath@@ ie degrees 3 the treatment is to break up until a improvement to degree 1 or 2 is achieved , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced .
there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dosage adjustment in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4 and 5.2 ) .
no studies were conducted with patients with imp@@ aired kidney function and there is currently no adequate data on the recommendation of dosage adjustment in patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to non @-@ sufficient data to in@@ consistency and effectiveness .
abra@@ x@@ ane is a Alb@@ um@@ in @-@ native nan@@ op@@ ic formations of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which could substantially have different pharmac@@ ological characteristics as other formulations of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be initiated immediately and treated with symptom@@ atic treatment , and the patient cannot be treated again with p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in patients should not be introduced to des@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles until the neutr@@ ro@@ phil@@ en@@ ers increased again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and has increased the th@@ rot@@ tle number on &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver dys@@ functions ( B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or A@@ SL / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with abra@@ sion .
while a clearly marked with abra@@ x@@ ane in relation to cardi@@ oto@@ x@@ icity has not been proven , cardiovascular diseases are not unusual , especially in patients with former anth@@ racycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart disease or lun@@ ar disease .
in case of patients who occur after the gift of abra@@ sive nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting and diar@@ rhe@@ a , these can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ e@@ tics and contra@@ sting means .
abra@@ x@@ ane should not practice at pregnant or in women in child@@ bearing age that are not applied to effective conception , except treatment of the mother with p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is un@@ avoidable .
women of child@@ bearing age should apply during and up to 1 month after the treatment with abra@@ sive method .
male patients who are treated with abra@@ sion will be advised during and up to six months after treatment no child testify .
male patients should be advised prior to treatment via a sperm archiving , since the therapy with abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of irrever@@ sible in@@ fertility .
abra@@ x@@ ane can cause unwanted side effects as fatigue ( very frequent ) and Sch@@ win@@ del ( common ) , which can affect the traffic and ability to operate machinery .
below are the most common and most important inci@@ dents of side effects listed in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic mam@@ ma@@ kar@@ zin@@ om which were treated in the pi@@ vot@@ al clinical phase III study once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 abra@@ x@@ ane .
Neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie was the ti@@ est important hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity ( in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly rever@@ sible and dos@@ is@@ dependent ; Leu@@ kop@@ enia was reported at 71 % of the patients .
An@@ a@@ emia ( H@@ B &lt; 10 g / d@@ l ) was observed at 46 % of patients treated with abra@@ x@@ ane treated patients and was severe in three cases ( H@@ B &lt; 8 g / d@@ l ) .
in table 1 are the side effects listed in conjunction with the gift of abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy with every dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .

p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an an@@ tim@@ i@@ kr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ules active ingredient which promotes the breakdown of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the Tub@@ ular Indi@@ ans and stabili@@ zes the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their land@@ ol@@ y@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabil@@ isation leads to a in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mi@@ kr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ul@@ ary network that is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ o@@ tic cell functions .
it is known that Alb@@ um@@ into the Trans@@ cy@@ t@@ osis from plasma components was convey@@ ed in the endo@@ th@@ el@@ cells and in the frame of in @-@ vit@@ ro studies have been proven that the presence of Alb@@ um@@ in the transport of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el promotes plant cells .
it is believed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ do@@ th@@ eli@@ al transport is convey@@ ed by the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ Alb@@ umin@@ ec@@ ept@@ or and due to the alb@@ umin@@ ous Prot@@ eins SP@@ ARC ( secre@@ ted protein Rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) occurs one p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation within the field of tum@@ ors .
the application of abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic Mam@@ om@@ kar@@ zin@@ om is supported by data of 106 patients in two single @-@ parti@@ ed studies and of 4@@ 54 patients , which were treated in a random@@ ised phase III @-@ comparative study .
in a study 43 patients with metastatic mam@@ ma@@ iden@@ om with abra@@ sion , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion of 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as in@@ fusion of 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic mam@@ ma@@ car@@ cin@@ oma .
this multi @-@ cent@@ ric study was carried out in patients with metastatic Mam@@ mac@@ eu@@ ticals , either in the form of soluble P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with pre@@ matur@@ ation for the prevention of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medication ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
for inclusion in the study , 64 % of patients had an imp@@ aired general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % more than 3 met@@ ast@@ o@@ est@@ ellen .
14 % of patients had not received chemotherapy before , 27 % had only one adjuv@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of met@@ ast@@ asi@@ fication and 19 % due to met@@ ast@@ asi@@ fication and adjuv@@ ant treatment .

the mean distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume points to a far @-@ reaching ex@@ trav@@ ascular distribution and / or ordination of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study involving patients with advanced solid tum@@ ors , the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic properties of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 solvent @-@ sized P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
the Clear@@ ance of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher ( 43 % ) after the abra@@ sive P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and also the distribution volume was higher for abra@@ x@@ ane higher ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature about in @-@ vit@@ ro studies of human micro@@ bes and tissues , p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is identified primarily to 6@@ α @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ di@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed .

the decision to apply re@@ combin@@ ant er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a value @-@ risk assessment involving the participation of the respective patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
in patients , which are intended for larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ edic intervention , if possible , prior to the beginning of the epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy the cause of an@@ emia is examined and treated accordingly .
patients suffering from an enlarged elec@@ tive orthop@@ edic surgery should maintain an adequate Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ os@@ e@@ proph@@ yla@@ xis , since they have an increased risk of thro@@ bla@@ sting and v@@ ascular diseases , especially with an underlying cardiovascular disease , have .
in addition , it cannot be excluded that treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa can consist of patients with a starting @-@ mo@@ tive increase of &gt; 13 g / d@@ l an increased risk of post@@ operative psych@@ ic / v@@ ascular events .

the most common side @-@ effect during the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dos@@ is@@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the deterioration of an existing hyper@@ tension .
an increased incidence of thro@@ tis@@ ous events ( see section 4.4 and Section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients under treatment with er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ inen .

the overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ osis and thus related complications with re@@ combin@@ ant@@ em human@@ ly er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ etic patients and at controls are satisfactory .
there is an increased risk of thro@@ st@@ bol@@ ous events in tum@@ ours that can be treated with re@@ combin@@ ant@@ em human@@ ly er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ine and a negative impact on the overall survival can not be excluded .
it is not clear how far these results are treated to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant@@ em human@@ ly er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ etic in tum@@ our patients suffering from chemotherapy with the aim of reaching a hem@@ ost@@ bin@@ ess under 13 g / d@@ l , because too few patients with these characteristics were included in the audi@@ ted data .

for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get may be prescribed by physicians who have experience in treating this disease .
as the active ingredient in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is the same as in Zom@@ eta , a part of the data material for Zom@@ eta was attracted to the evaluation of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
in the first study almost 8 000 older women were involved with oste@@ opor@@ osis and it was investigated the number of verteb@@ rates and hip frac@@ tures for a period of three years .
the second study comprised of 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , who recently suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; it was examined the number of frac@@ tures over a period of up to five years .
at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get was tested A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in two studies on a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months .
main inde@@ b@@ ator for the effectiveness was whether the content of the al@@ kal@@ ine Ph@@ osph@@ at@@ ase is in Ser@@ um ( an enzy@@ me that builds bone sub@@ stance ) in the blood again norm@@ alized or by at least 75 % compared to the initial value .
in the study with older women the risk of verteb@@ rates for patients was reduced under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( without any other oste@@ opor@@ os@@ em@@ edi@@ kam@@ ente ) over a period of three years compared to the patients under placebo .
compared to all patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( with or without any other oste@@ opor@@ os@@ em@@ edi@@ kam@@ ente ) with those on placebo the risk of hip frac@@ tures were reduced by 41 % .
in the study with men and women with hip frac@@ ture , 9 % of patients suffering from A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( 92 from 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients below placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less common in repeti@@ tive in@@ fu@@ sions .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a must not be used in patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against customs ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ ate or any of the other components .
as with all buff@@ ers , patients are subject to patients with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a to the risk of kidney diseases , reactions to in@@ fusion and oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose ( die of bone tissue ) in the ja@@ ws .
the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a provides clarification material for doctors ready to apply the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis , as well as similar material for patients , in which the medication side effects are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor .

for the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men there is a intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a once a year .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ mati@@ cal hip , the administration of in@@ fusion is recommended by A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a two or more weeks after the operating supply of the hip frac@@ ture ( see Section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after a treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , a long re@@ vocation period was observed in patients who are addressed to the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is very advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient intake of calcium , accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recently exp@@ ired low @-@ trau@@ mati@@ cal hip , a initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis is recommended from 50,000 to 12@@ 5.000 , or@@ alem or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D before the first A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , can be reduced by gift of Par@@ agli@@ amo@@ l or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the use of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
patients with kidney function ( see Section 4.4 ) In patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended as limited clinical experiences available for this patient group .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dosage adjustment is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients .
children and young people A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended for the use of children and adolescents under 18 years of age , since data are missing and effectiveness .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) because of these patient population only limited clinical experiences .
a pre @-@ existing hypo@@ theses is to be treated before the beginning of therapy with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a by sufficient intake of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the quick inser@@ tion of the effect of Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone construction , a temporary hypo@@ thesis can develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in addition , it is very advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient intake of calcium , accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see Section 4.2 ) .

kidney @-@ disorder Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid was associated with kidney function , which is expressed as a decrease in the kidney function ( i.e. an increase of ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as an active kidney failure .
the change in the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( yearly before administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as a restricted kidney function were comparable in a clinical study at oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years compared between the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a- and the placebo group .
a temporary increase of ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of gift was observed at 1.8 % of patients with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated patients compared to 0.@@ 8 % of patients treated with placebo @-@ treated patients .
based on the assessment of the laboratories , the temporary calcium values reported below the normal tail range ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , at 2.4 % of the patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in a large clinical trial @-@ treated patients compared to 21 % of the patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies @-@ treated patients .
all patients received supple@@ mental amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study on post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis in the study to avoid clinical questionn@@ aires following a hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see Section 4.2 ) .
in the study for the prevention of clinical questionn@@ aires following a recently exp@@ elled hip frac@@ ture , the majority of patients received an initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis vitamin D before administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see Section 4.2 ) .
local reactions After the administration of Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical study was reported via local reactions to the in@@ fusion , such as redness , swelling and / or pain , reports ( 0.@@ 7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen in the ortho@@ don@@ key was occasionally on cancer patients , above all cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses ( primary in the ortho@@ don@@ key ) , which were treated with Bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .

abstract of the EC@@ PA@@ R for the public this document is a summary of the European Public Appe@@ al report ( E@@ PA@@ R ) , which explains how the studies performed for human therapeutic products ( CH@@ MP ) has made studies in order to get recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
Ac@@ tos is applied to treat type @-@ 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be applied alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) where Met@@ form@@ in ( a di@@ abolic drug ) is not shown . • It can be applied together with another di@@ ab@@ et@@ es@@ medi@@ ator ( du@@ therapy ) .
it can be applied in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) which cannot be satisfactory with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest tolerated dose .
in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ um or ins@@ ulin , the previous dose of the sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ine@@ s or the ins@@ ulin can be retained with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( lower blood sugar ) ; here the dose of the sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ine@@ s or the ins@@ ulin should be reduced .
this means that the body &apos;s physical ins@@ ulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases , which enables type @-@ 2 @-@ diabetes to be set better .
with more than 1 400 patients the effectiveness of Ac@@ tos in tri@@ ple@@ tion were examined ; the patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ um , in addition they received up to 3.5 years either Ac@@ tos or placebo .
in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ ulated h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) measured , which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tos resulted in lowering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which can close the blood sugar levels in the application of the doses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ tion study the effect of the additional gift of Ac@@ tos to existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and an sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ants in a reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by 0.@@ 94 % , whereas the additional gift of placebo for a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % led .
in a small study , in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and ins@@ ulin was examined in 2@@ 89 patients , the patients , the Ac@@ tos in addition to ins@@ ulin took , a reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared with 0.@@ 14 % in the patients who took additionally placebo .
the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were visual dys@@ functions , infections of the upper air@@ ways ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ a@@ es@@ thesia ( reduced sensitivity to irrit@@ ating ) .
Ac@@ tos may not be used in patients which may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) compared to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or one of the other components , still in patients with liver problems , heart in@@ suffici@@ ency or diabe@@ tic sound levels ( high ket@@ one levels - sa@@ wing tiles - in the blood ) .
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos should serve as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in patients when Met@@ form@@ in is not displayed .
October 2000 , the European Commission shared the Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited appro@@ ving a permit for the settlement of Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union .
the tablets are white until white , round , v@@ aul@@ ted and carry on one side the marking &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other hand the wording of AC@@ T@@ OS . &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is also shown for the combination with ins@@ ulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is insufficient with ins@@ ulin and with which met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or in@@ compatibility is un@@ suitable ( see section 4.4 ) .
for the application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under 18 years of age are not available any data , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients suffering from the presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. former heart disease or symptom@@ atic coron@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest possible dose and increase the dose .
patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of a heart attack , weight gain or oils , especially those with reduced cardiovascular reserve .
patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency , to gain weight growth and oils , when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is applied in combination with ins@@ ulin .
a cardiovascular out@@ come study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ as@@ cul@@ ary disorder has been carried out .
this study showed an increase in reports of heart in@@ suffici@@ ency , which however did not lead to an increase in Mor@@ t@@ ality in the study .
in patients with increased output levels ( AL@@ T &gt; 2,5 x upper limit of the normal division ) or with other signs of liver disease may not be used Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on .
if the AL@@ T mirror can be increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the board , the liver ymers are to control once again as soon as possible .
if a patient symptoms are developed to refer to a hep@@ atic erectile dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting , torso , appetite , appetite , appetite , and / or dar@@ ker , are the liver pol@@ ymers to check .
the decision whether treatment of patients with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on continues to be continued until the pre@@ lies of the laboratory parameters of clinical trial .
in clinical studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , a dos@@ ages @-@ dependent weight gain has been proven that can be bre@@ wing of fat deposits , and in some cases it is connected with a liquid state .
as a result of a her@@ modi@@ fying under the therapy with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on a slightly reduced reduction of the medium hem@@ ost@@ bin@@ ed ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and the hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.4 % ) .
similar changes have been observed at comparable controlled studies with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under Met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of the h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in um 3 @-@ 4 % ) and a lower extent also in patients under sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ osis and Ins@@ ulin ( relative reduction of the h@@ emo@@ glob@@ ins by 1 @-@ 2 % and the hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3 % ) .
as a result of the increased ins@@ ulin @-@ sensitive surgery , in patients , the pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is considered or@@ ale two or triple com@@ bin@@ ation therapy with ins@@ ulin li@@ bin@@ ation therapy with ins@@ ulin , the risk of dos@@ ages @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .

it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and the appearance of mac@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ de@@ ms , if patients report on disorders of visual acu@@ ity ; a suitable oph@@ thalm@@ ologic declaration should be considered .

in the pro@@ active study , a study conducted over 3.5 years to study cardiovascular events , questionn@@ aires occurred at 44 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 % inc@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years ) with patients treated with a compar@@ atively medication .
the patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy and if a patient wants a pregnancy or this occurs , the treatment is fail@@ ing ( see section 4.@@ 6 ) .
studies on investig@@ ating the interactions have shown that pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on does not have relevant effects on the pharmaceuticals or pharmaceutical dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
interactions with medicines that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. or@@ ale contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium @-@ channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A @-@ reduction are not expected .
the simultaneous application of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with Gem@@ fi@@ bro@@ zi@@ l ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulting in an increase in the AU@@ C by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on around the 3 @-@ fold .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 in@@ duction ) resulting in lowering the AU@@ C by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
this is due to this due to the treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on which decreases in the pregnancy hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ in@@ a@@ emia and increased ins@@ ulin resistance of the mat@@ ernity and thus reduces the availability of met@@ abolic sub@@ str@@ ates for red@@ dish growth .

these lead to a temporary variation of the turbine and the Bre@@ eding inde@@ xes of the lens , as they are also observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic agents .
in clinical studies with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on they appeared in clinical studies on the triple of the upper limit of the normal division frequently on how to placebo but less common than in compar@@ isons under Met@@ form@@ in or Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff .

since the launch has rarely been reported via heart in@@ suffici@@ ency in Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , more frequently when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was applied in combination with ins@@ ulin or in patients with cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese .

in the more than a period of 3.5 years of ongoing pro@@ active study , questionn@@ aires occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.6 % ) of the patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2,5 % ) in patients treated with a compar@@ atively medication .
when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days occurred no symptoms .
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on seems to work on a activation of specific nuclear recept@@ ors ( per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome pro@@ lifer@@ ator Activ@@ ated Rec@@ ept@@ or @-@ g ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ g ) ) , resulting in the animal @-@ model to an increased ins@@ ulin in liver , fat and skel@@ eton muscle cells .
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduces glu@@ cose production in the liver and increases the periph@@ eral glu@@ cos@@ ity in case of ins@@ ulin resistance .
a clinical study with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on versus Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de as Mon@@ otherapy was continued over two years to investigate the time up to the post@@ ur@@ ing of the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.@@ 0 % after the first 6 treatment months ) .
at the time after two years after the beginning of therapy a blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.@@ 0 % ) by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on at 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de ) are maintained .
in a plac@@ ebo@@ x study over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar were inadequate despite dre@@ im@@ on@@ ati@@ cal optimization phase with ins@@ ulin , to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or placebo .
in patients under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduced the average H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c - value by 0.@@ 45 % , compared to the patient who continued only ins@@ ulin ; a reduction of ins@@ ulin in the group treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated group was observed .
in clinical studies about one year , under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on has shown a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the Alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Qu@@ o@@ ti@@ ent in comparison to the output values .
the effect of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( Mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small , on 18 weeks investigation of type @-@ 2 diabe@@ tics .
in most clinical trials compared to placebo a reduction of the overall plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and an increase of HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels as well as a minor but clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ - cholesterol levels observed .
in clinical studies about a period of up to two years reduced pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de the total plastic gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol levels .
compared to placebo under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , there was no statisti@@ cally significant increase in the L@@ DL cholesterol levels , while under Met@@ form@@ in and Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de reduced values have been observed .
in a study about 20 weeks reduced pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on not only the so@@ ber tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de , but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des levels , this is both an effect on the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and the hep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ d synthesis .
in the pro@@ active study , a cardiovascular out@@ come study , 5@@ 2@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ as@@ cul@@ ary disorder in groups random@@ ized , which received over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing anti@@ diabe@@ tic and cardiovascular therapy either pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or placebo .
after oral application Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is quickly res@@ or@@ ated , whereby the top concentr@@ ations of un@@ changing pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on can be reached in plasma 2 hours after application .
on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV for the effectiveness in about the triple of the effectiveness of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal .
in Inter@@ action studies could be proven that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on has no relevant effect on the pharmaceuticals or pharmaceutical dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
the simultaneous application of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with Gem@@ fi@@ bro@@ zi@@ l ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ induc@@ tor ) or lowers the Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( see Section 4.5 ) .
according to oral application of radio@@ active markings pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in humans the marker was found mainly in the thread ( 55 % ) and a lower extent in the har@@ n ( 45 % ) .
the mean plasma @-@ elimination period of un@@ changing pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on amounts to people 5 @-@ 6 hours , and all of the active met@@ abolic rate lies at 16 - 23 hours .
the Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ations from Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and its Met@@ abol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function lower than with healthy prob@@ es , whereby the rates of the oral clearing of the mat@@ ernity are resem@@ ble .
in to@@ xi@@ ologic studies occurred in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys in agreement after repeti@@ tive administration of plasma volume , an@@ a@@ emia and rever@@ sible ec@@ cent@@ ric heart hyper@@ trop@@ hia .
this is due to this due to the treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on which dimin@@ ished in the shape of hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ in@@ a@@ emia and increased ins@@ ulin resistance of the mat@@ ernity and reduces the availability of met@@ abolic sub@@ str@@ ates for red@@ dish growth .

in addition , the cans of Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane may need to be adapted when it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood sugar ( the complete list is the package price ) .
the Committee on Human Resources ( CH@@ MP ) to conclude that the benefits of Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ an in the treatment of diabetes are compared to the risks .
October 2002 , the European Commission presented the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S a permit for in@@ verse by Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ an in the entire European Union .
pre @-@ mixed ins@@ ulin products are usually applied once or twice daily when a quick initi@@ ale effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
the inj@@ ectors must be charged at least 6 seconds long under the skin to ensure that the entire dosage was inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood sugar is significantly improved by a intensified ins@@ ulin therapy , the hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia @-@ War@@ n@@ symptoms can be changed and should be advised accordingly .
any change regarding strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , ins@@ ulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ ph@@ as@@ tical , long @-@ effective ins@@ ulin , or in@@ sul@@ in@@ an@@ alo@@ gon ) and / or manufacturing method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA to ins@@ ulin animal origin ) may result in a change of dosage is required .
if a dosage adjustment is necessary during the transition to Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ an , it may be necessary in the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
some patients in which hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic reactions occurred after a change of animal in human ins@@ ulin , reported that the early warnings of a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia were less pronounced or different than with their previous ins@@ ulin .
before trips that go over several time zones , the patient should be pointed to the advice of his physician because such travel can lead to that ins@@ ulin and meals are applied or taken to other times .
the doctor must therefore consider possible interactions with the therapy and always ask his patients to ask for other medicines .

the effect begins within half an hour , the active substance will be reached within 2 to 8 hours and the whole capacity is up to 24 hours .
Res@@ or@@ ption The res@@ or@@ tion profile is due to the fact that it is a mixture of ins@@ ulin products with faster or delayed res@@ or@@ ption .
a series of sp@@ ection ( hydro@@ ly@@ se@@ - ) places on the Human@@ ins@@ ul@@ in@@ mol@@ ules were considered , none of the met@@ abolic met@@ af@@ ites were active .

Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id must not be used in patients who may be over@@ sensitive to ins@@ ulin human ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , the cans of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id may need to be adjusted when it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood sugar .
October 2002 , the European Commission presented the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S a permit for in@@ solven@@ cy of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id throughout the European Union .
when two types of ins@@ ulin are mixed , first the amount of the fast @-@ acting In@@ sul@@ ins must be raised , then the amount of long @-@ acting In@@ sul@@ ins .
3 In case of switching to Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id when patient is required a dosage adjustment can be necessary in the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
before trips that go over several time zones , the patient should be pointed to the advice of his physician because such travel can lead to that ins@@ ulin and meals are applied or taken to other times .

if the ureth@@ ra is still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ ite , the dose may be increased to 120 mg once a day .
during the first treatment months of treatment still toxicity may occur ; therefore , advised that patients may take at least during the first six months of treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic nor further medicines for the prevention of tox@@ ic@@ an@@ cies .
the medicine is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ tran@@ spl@@ ant because it was not studied for these groups .

in the second study two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was applied in a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main inde@@ b@@ ator for the effectiveness was the number of patients , their ureth@@ ra in the blood with the last three measurements under 6 mg / d@@ l lay .
in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 2@@ 62 ) of patients , the Aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg income , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of patients , once daily 120 mg , in the last three measurements a ur@@ inary acid level in the blood of under 6 mg / d@@ l .
compared to this , this was 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and no of the 134 patients under placebo .
the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , skin rash and ab@@ normal liver values .
especially in patients with heart defects , there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Human@@ itarian Therap@@ y ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ur@@ inary tract in the blood of more effective than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects associated with the heart and blood vessels .

if the Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ sow@@ ed bricks after 2 @-@ 4 weeks still amounts to 6 mg / d@@ l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , a dosage increase can be considered at AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily .
in patients with severe kidney functions , the effectiveness and security have not been fully examined ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ - Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) .

it is therefore recommended to carry out before the start of the F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at@@ treatment and in the further course depending on the clin@@ ically report a liver clean@@ est ( see section 5.1 ) .
The@@ ophy@@ l@@ line was conducted not removable studies at F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O shirts can lead to an increase in the the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line image ( a inhibit@@ ing of the met@@ abolic ization of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line was also reported for other X@@ O @-@ Hem@@ mer ) .
at Pro@@ ban@@ den was the simultaneous gift of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and Nap@@ ro@@ xen 250 mg 2 x daily with an increase in F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at@@ ement ( C@@ max 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and T@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical studies the application of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 @-@ shirts are not related to a clin@@ ically significant increase of unwanted events .
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in , without having a dosage adjustment for f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or at the same time spent other agents .
in a study involving promot@@ ers 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x daily a medium 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strate which indicates a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at to the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzy@@ me in vi@@ vo .
An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of a ant@@ acid , the magnesium @-@ hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminium hydro@@ xi@@ de ( about 1 hour ) delayed and a decline of the C@@ max around 32 % , but no significant change in the AU@@ C result .
pregnancy data via a very limited number of exp@@ ired pregn@@ an@@ cies cannot be taken on side effects of m@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at to the pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ bor@@ ns .
animal experimental studies do not leave directly or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embryonic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see Section 5.3 ) .
patients should be careful when taxes of a vehicle , use of machines or in the exercise of dangerous activities until they can be certain that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC affects their performance .
a numer@@ ically higher incidence of the exam@@ in@@ ol group reported in the overall f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at@@ ascular group in the pi@@ vot@@ al study of phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) and in long @-@ term - extension studies ( 1,4 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no fixed connection with f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at could be found .
the risk factors in these patients were a arter@@ ial erotic illness and / or a m@@ yo@@ k@@ ard@@ in@@ color , or a de@@ compens@@ ated heart attack in the nurse .
frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) side effects which could occur in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and which were reported in all f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatments altogether more than once , are listed below .
diar@@ rhe@@ a , nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting are more common in patients who are simultaneously treated with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In the clinical trials no serious skin @-@ off@@ s or severe hyper@@ sensitive actions were observed .
7 Off@@ ene slow@@ ing studies in the open long @-@ time studies have been treated 9@@ 06 patients up to 1 year long , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years long , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
the events reported during long @-@ term studies @-@ related events were similar to those reported in the studies of phase 3 ( see table 1 ) .
the following treatment related events were reported in all f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at@@ - treatment groups in total more than once and occurred in patients , the F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term failure studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1.@@ 900 patient @-@ years ) , according to the statements occasionally on .

clinical study results The effectiveness of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC has been described in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ act study as described below ) , which were conducted with 1.@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ uri@@ k@@ emia and tox@@ ics .
the primary activity point was in each study of the proportion of patients , where the last three months were certain Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ sow@@ ed bricks &lt; 6.@@ 0 mg / d@@ l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 2@@ 67 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg / d@@ l or 100 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with a Ser@@ um Cre@@ ole range at the beginning of &gt; 1.5 mg / d@@ l and &lt; 2,@@ 0 mg / d@@ l .
the AP@@ EX study showed at 6 mg / d@@ l ( see table 2 and figure 1 ) ( see table 2 and figure 1 ) ( see table 2 and figure 1 ) ( see table 2 and figure 1 ) ( see table 2 and figure 1 ) ( see table 2 and figure 1 ) daily compared to the treatment with traditional doses Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ act study showed in view of the permanent reduction of serv@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ bag pi@@ le under 6 mg / d@@ l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) the statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with the traditional dose Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
patients with Ser@@ um@@ Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2,@@ 0 mg / d@@ l ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 509 ) were summar@@ ised for analyses . * p &lt; 0,@@ 001 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0,@@ 001 versus 80 mg
lowering the Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ sä@@ ur@@ es@@ pi@@ le on &lt; 6.@@ 0 mg / d@@ l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the doctor &apos;s visit to week 2 and permanently maintain the entire treatment .
509 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with Ser@@ um Cre@@ ate &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2,@@ 0 mg / d@@ l received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end @-@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney func@@ tionally The AP@@ EX study evaluated the effectiveness at 40 patients with kidney functions ( d. h ) .
with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC the primary activity point at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients reached .
there was no clin@@ ically significant differences with regard to the percentage of Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ acid acid concentration at pro@@ ban@@ den , regardless of their kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney dysfunction ) .
primary end @-@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ acid mut@@ ations ≥ 10 mg / d@@ l About 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ act study ) had a Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / d@@ l .
the data collected during two years in the open reference study of phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction in the Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ sow@@ ed bricks rose to &lt; 6 mg / d@@ l ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , so that less than 3 % of patients needed in the months 16 @-@ 24 ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients needed no treatment against a plaster ) .
this was associated with a reduction of the tox@@ ic@@ ation size , which had a complete disappearance of the plaster no@@ des up to the month 24 % of the patients .
increased TS@@ H@@ - Valu@@ es ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) have been observed in patients who received a long @-@ term treatment with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.6 % ) and also in patients , the Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.6 % ) in the open long @-@ term extension studies ( see Section 4.4 ) .
at healthy pro@@ ban@@ den increased the maximum plasma con@@ cent@@ ric system ( C@@ max ) and the area under the Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation period ( AU@@ C ) of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at after agreement easier and multi@@ pler cans from 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportional .
for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg is observed for F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at an increase in AU@@ C , which is greater than the dos@@ is@@ dis@@ proportionate increase .
after ing@@ esting simple or multi @-@ pl@@ ers of 80 and 120 mg 1 x per day the C@@ max is about 2.8 @-@ 3,@@ 2 µ@@ g / ml and 5,@@ 0 @-@ 5,@@ 3 µ@@ g / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change in the percentage decrease in the Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ acid concentration , provided that this was tested ( multiple cans of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent ste@@ ady state distribution volume ( V@@ SS / F ) of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is located in the range from 29 to 75 l to intake of doses from 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plastic connection of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at amounts to approximately 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary bond to Alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant above the concentration width , which is achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
in vit@@ ro @-@ studies in human li@@ festyles showed that these oxid@@ ative Met@@ abol@@ ites showed that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 are formed , and that F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at@@ scher cur@@ oni@@ d is built mainly by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 .
after taking a 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ mark@@ i@@ ded F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at found themselves about 49 % of the dose in urine as un@@ changing F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , its known oxid@@ ative Met@@ abol@@ ites and its con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) as well as other un@@ known Met@@ abol@@ ites ( 3 % ) .
in addition to the ex@@ cre@@ tion over the urine , there was also about 45 % of the dose in the chair as un@@ changing F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , its known oxid@@ ative Met@@ abol@@ ites and its con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) as well as other un@@ familiar Met@@ abol@@ ites ( 7 % ) .
special patient groups of kidney doses after ing@@ es@@ low doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with lighter , moderate or severe kidney failure , the C@@ max of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at changed not in proportion to pro@@ ban@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at with normal kidney function .
the mid @-@ scale AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at took about the 1.8 @-@ fold from 7.5 μ . h / ml in the group with normal kidney function on 13.@@ 2 μ in the group with severe kidney function .

these findings are seen as a result of specific Pur@@ in@@ met@@ isation and urine composition and is not relevant for clinical use as a result .
it was established that F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in oral cans of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on the fertili@@ zation and re@@ production performance of male and female rats .
at high doses , which were approximately at 4.@@ 3 times of human therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxicity arise , the mat@@ ernal toxicity entered , which was accompanied with a lowering of the Auf@@ zu@@ cht@@ age and a development delay in the descendants of rats .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease where the bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after men@@ op@@ ause , where a risk for a low vitamin D mirror is made .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acid , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid an irrit@@ ation of o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient must take up until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest , 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
as Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at and vitamin D@@ 3 are already used separately in medicines that are approved in the European Union , the company received data from previous studies and published literature .
the company also led a study with 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis to meet the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in terms of increasing vitamin D spi@@ ders .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment the proportion of patients with low vitamin D mirrors have been treated with the patients who were treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 11 % ) than with those who only income Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at income ( 32 % ) .
the company also set data before giving the Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at dose exactly the dose which is needed for preventing a bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of muscul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones , or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system , dy@@ sp@@ urs ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , si@@ p@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , si@@ p@@ rhe@@ a ( lo@@ wered abdom@@ en ) , infl@@ ated abdom@@ en ( blow@@ n stomach ) as well as sau@@ ces .
in patients with et@@ horizontal hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , vitamin D@@ 3 or any of the other components may not be used by AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
it may not be used in diseases of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia or in patients who cannot stand up or sit at least 30 minutes .
Janu@@ ary@@ 2007 elected the European Commission of Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ any Ltd . a permit for inclusion of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in the entire European Union .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or taking medicines ( including ant@@ acid , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
the following notes are accurate to follow in order to reduce the risk of men@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and related side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed after the day only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • The patients should not chew@@ ing the tablet or the tablet in the mouth , as a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a consists of . • The patients should not be carried out before the first food intake of the day , which should take place earlier than 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
B. pe@@ p@@ tic Ul@@ kus , active gast@@ ro@@ intestinal ble@@ eding or surgical interventions at the upper gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract but P@@ yl@@ or@@ op@@ last@@ y , only under special caution ( see section 4.3 ) .
Ö@@ sop@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as Ö@@ sop@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al Ul@@ zer@@ a and ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ g@@ ations , rarely followed by ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al Stri@@ tions , were reported in patients under the intake of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( partly these severe and required a hospital assignment ) .
the doctor should therefore alert attention to all signs and symptoms that are advised on possible ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation such as dy@@ cel@@ ag@@ ie , pain when swal@@ lowing or retro@@ ant pain , or new or wor@@ lim@@ mer@@ ing so@@ d@@ ling the medicine and obtain medical advice ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
3 The risk of he@@ ed@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients that do not take the medicine correctly and / or it after the occurrence of symptoms that refer to a solution @-@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dosage instructions can be passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see Section 4.2 ) .
while in large pre@@ determined clinical studies with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at no higher risk has been determined , were rare ( according to market introduction ) stomach and du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ cer@@ a , including some serious severe and with complications , reported ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose of the Kie@@ fer , usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose therapy regime contains predominantly intraven@@ ous bis@@ phosph@@ ate .
there are no data available to indicate whether the inser@@ tion of a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ at@@ therapy in patients who require a ortho@@ graphy surgical procedure , reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose of the Kie@@ fer .
the clinical assessment by the treated doctor is decisive for treatment planning in each patient based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
patients should be reli@@ ant that they should take the tablet every morning after taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , after having noticed its failure .
they should not take two tablets on the same day , but taking the intake of one tablet a week as originally planned at this week@@ day .
other diseases that affect the mineral metabolism ( like vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) , should be treated at the beginning of therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE as well .
Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at Food and Be@@ verages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acid and some or@@ ale medicines may affect the res@@ or@@ ption of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at if they are taken at the same time .
therefore patients must wait after taking Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific Inter@@ action studies were not conducted , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at in clinical studies have been taken together with a variety of usually prescribed medicines without that clin@@ ically relevant interactions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for application of post @-@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy nor of breast@@ feeding women .
animal studies with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at cannot be viewed directly damaging effects in relation to pregnancy , the embryo / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose of the j@@ aw was reported in patients under Bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports originate from cancer patients , however , was also reported at oste@@ opor@@ os@@ ep@@ ati@@ ans .

Adv@@ ag@@ raf is administered to adult patients whose kidney or liver has been transplan@@ ts to prevent a desc@@ end of transplan@@ ts by the immune system .
since Tac@@ ru@@ lim@@ us and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft has already been used in the EU , the company has presented the results of previously performed studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from the published literature .
furthermore , the results of a clinical study were presented to 6@@ 68 patients with Ni@@ er@@ entran@@ ts , whereby the application of Adv@@ ag@@ raf with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in was compared .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the number of patients with which the tran@@ spl@@ ant was cr@@ ashed after a treatment duration of one year ( by example , for example , how often a renewed organ transplan@@ tation or a res@@ ump@@ tion of the di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) .
in addition , more recent studies on 119 patients with low transplan@@ tation and 129 patients were carried out with liver tran@@ spl@@ ant and examined how Adv@@ ag@@ raf is recorded in comparison to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft from the body .

in patients with et@@ horizontal hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against Tac@@ raw lim@@ us , macro@@ lid antibiotics ( such as er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or one of the other components may not be applied .
patients and doctors have to be careful when others ( especially herbal ) medicines will simultaneously be taken simultaneously with Adv@@ ag@@ raf because the Adv@@ ag@@ raf @-@ dose or the dose of the same medication may be adjusted accordingly .

only doctors who are familiar with the immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and the treatment of tran@@ spl@@ ant patients should assign this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences of the systemic exposure of Tac@@ vi@@ lim@@ us this can lead to tran@@ spl@@ its or to an increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or over@@ immun@@ o@@ immune systems .
patients should always keep the same Tac@@ on@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; change of formulation or the regime should be conducted only under the tigh@@ tening control of one in the tran@@ spl@@ ant @-@ experienced physician ( see sections 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
as a result of a conversion to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic medication must be carried out and corresponding dosage adjustments to ensure that the systemic exposure of Tac@@ vi@@ lim@@ us will remain .
the dosage of Adv@@ ag@@ raf should be primarily based on the clinical assessment of dis@@ sto@@ cking and compatibility in individual case and on blood levels .
after the conversion of Pro@@ gra@@ f on Adv@@ ag@@ raf , the Tac@@ ru@@ lim@@ us valley should be controlled before the change@@ over and over two weeks of conversion .
the day 4 was the systemic exposure , measured as a se@@ am mirror , comparable with both formulations both in kidney and le@@ aning patients .
careful and repeat@@ able controls of the Tac@@ ru@@ lim@@ us valley mirror are recommended during the first two weeks after tran@@ spl@@ ant under Adv@@ ag@@ raf to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate after@@ math phase .
since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low clearing , an adjustment of the Adv@@ ag@@ raf @-@ Dos@@ is@@ esch@@ eme can take several days until the ste@@ ady State reaches .
if the condition of the patient in the first post@@ operative phase no or@@ ale intake of medicines allows , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentr@@ ates on the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) are introduced with a dose of ca .
the duration of the application to the repression of the transplan@@ tation must be maintained by the immune system ; consequ@@ ent can therefore not be given a maximum duration of the oral therapy .
dosage recommendations - Ni@@ er@@ entran@@ tation proph@@ yla@@ xis of the transplan@@ tation The or@@ ale Adv@@ ag@@ raf therapy should start with 0,@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as a day daily gift in the morning .
further dos@@ is@@ adjustments can be later required since the Phar@@ o@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can change in the course of stabili@@ zation of patients after transplan@@ tation .
dos@@ is@@ recommendations - liver tran@@ spl@@ ant proph@@ yla@@ xis the or@@ ale Adv@@ ag@@ raf therapy should start with 0,@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a day daily gift in the morning .
dosage route - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f on Adv@@ ag@@ raf must be a tran@@ spl@@ ant receiver of twice daily dosage of pro@@ gra@@ f capsules on a once daily intake of Adv@@ ag@@ raf &apos;s times , this change@@ over in relation 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the entire daily dose .
kidney and liver tran@@ spl@@ ant After an conversion from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ ants to Adv@@ ag@@ raf once daily , the treatment with the respectively in Ni@@ er@@ en- and liver tran@@ spl@@ ant initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis must begin with the proph@@ yla@@ xis of the transplan@@ tation .
heart transplan@@ tation At adult patients who are being placed on Adv@@ ag@@ raf is a oral Initi@@ al dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day every day in the morning .
other tran@@ spl@@ itter makes it no clinical experience with Adv@@ ag@@ raf for lung , pan@@ ties and col@@ on transplan@@ ts occurred in a oral Initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis of 0.@@ 10 mg / kg / day and during intestinal transplan@@ ts in an oral Initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis of 0.@@ 3 mg / kg / day .
dosage adjustment in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function to maintain blood talents in the desired area can be required in patients with severe liver functioning of the dose .
patients with reduced kidney function Da the kidney function has no influence on the pharmaceuticals of Tac@@ vi@@ lim@@ us , can be assumed that a dosage adjustment is not required .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ oto@@ x@@ ical potenti@@ als of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , a me@@ tic@@ ing monitoring of kidney function ( including a regular determination of the Ser@@ um@@ cre@@ at@@ in@@ insp@@ ects , a calculation of cre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ ers and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) .
change@@ over from Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in on Adv@@ ag@@ raf in the change@@ over from a Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in@@ - to a tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is advisable ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations on the valley mirror in full @-@ bloo@@ dies@@ t The dose should be primarily based on the clinical assessment of dis@@ sto@@ cking and toler@@ ability in the individual case under the aid of full @-@ bloo@@ dies@@ t @-@ Tal@@ si controls .
it is recommended to carry out frequent checks of the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley levels during the first two weeks after tran@@ spl@@ ant , followed by perio@@ dic checks during the maintenance therapy .
blood circulation of Tac@@ vi@@ lim@@ us should also change after the conversion of Pro@@ gra@@ f on Adv@@ ag@@ raf , dosage adjustment , changes of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or even more simultaneous application of substances which could change the Tac@@ ru@@ lim@@ us whol@@ ec@@ cent@@ ric concentr@@ ations ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since Adv@@ ag@@ raf is a medicine with a low clearing , adjustments of the dose may need several days until the ste@@ ady state has entered .
the data in clinical studies make it possible that a successful treatment is possible in most cases if the slow@@ s not exceed the blood 20 n@@ g / ml .
in clinical practice , the slow@@ s of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us lie in full swing in the first time after liver tran@@ spl@@ ations usually in the range of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and for ren@@ al patients with 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml .
during the following nar@@ ration treatment of liver , Ni@@ er@@ en- and cardi@@ ac @-@ transplan@@ ts were usually used blood concentr@@ ations in the range of 5 to 15 n@@ g / ml .
this has led to severe und@@ es@@ irable events , including transplan@@ ting or other side effects which can occur in a sequence of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us under@@ or or exposure .
patients should always keep the same Tac@@ on@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; change of formulation or the regime should be conducted only under the tigh@@ tening control of one in the tran@@ spl@@ ant @-@ experienced physician ( see sections 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with transplan@@ tation , which proved to be done against other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ s@@ ants as re@@ frac@@ tory products , there are no clinical data for re@@ tar@@ ded formulation Adv@@ ag@@ raf .
for proph@@ yla@@ xis of the transplan@@ tation on adult heart transplan@@ ts and tran@@ spl@@ its people in the chin @-@ age are not yet no clinical data for the re@@ tar@@ ded formulation Adv@@ ag@@ raf .
because of possible interactions , which can lead to a tigh@@ tening of the tac@@ kl@@ lim@@ b levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the intake of herbal supplements , the cur@@ rant ( hyper@@ icum per@@ for@@ atum ) , or other plant cures during a treatment with Adv@@ ag@@ raf ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea is a particularly careful monitoring of the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - concentr@@ ations in the blood provided that the Tac@@ ru@@ lim@@ us blood mirror in such circumstances can be significant fluctu@@ ations .
in rare cases , under Pro@@ gra@@ f there was a cardi@@ omy@@ opath@@ y attached chamber - or Sept@@ um@@ hyper@@ trop@@ hia , which can therefore also be found under Adv@@ ag@@ raf .
other factors that increase the risk of such sound@@ ing disorders , are an already existing heart suffering , a treatment with cor@@ tical ero@@ ids , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver dys@@ functions , infections , liquid over@@ load and oils .
as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ s@@ va , the impact of sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of mal@@ ign@@ ing skin lesi@@ ons by suitable clothing or use of a solar protection by means of a high protective factor .
if patients , the Tac@@ vi@@ lim@@ us occupy symptoms for pr@@ es like head@@ aches , altered state of consciousness , cr@@ ashes and visual disorders , should be a radi@@ ological investigation ( e.@@ g .

the simultaneous application of medicines or herbal remedies that are known as Hem@@ mer or in@@ duction of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can affect the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and thus reduce the blood values of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or lower their blood values .
it is therefore recommended to change the Tac@@ ru@@ lim@@ us@@ - blood mirror at the same gift of substances which can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and to adjust the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose to maintain uniform concentr@@ ations accordingly ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) .

advoc@@ ate is used for treatment and prevention of ble@@ eding in patients with H@@ äm@@ ophi@@ lia A ( one by the lack of factor VIII conditioned , inn@@ ate ble@@ eding disorder ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application varies according to whether Adv@@ ate is applied to the treatment of ble@@ eding or to prevent ble@@ eding in surgical procedures .
patients with H@@ äm@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency , which causes blood cl@@ amping problems like ble@@ eding in joints , muscles or internal organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but according to a method that is called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology . &quot;
it is produced by a cell that has been introduced into an gene ( DNA ) which resulted in the formation of the human scent factor VIII .
advoc@@ ate is similar to another in the European Union approved medicines called re@@ agents , however , is otherwise made otherwise , so that the drug contains no proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate H@@ äm@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study with 53 children under six years , the application of the drug was examined by means of prevention of ble@@ eding and in surgical procedures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the main study the effectiveness of Adv@@ ate in the prevention of ble@@ eding in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new blood sep@@ sis has been awarded with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are Sch@@ win@@ em@@ , head@@ aches , Py@@ re@@ xy ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII .
advoc@@ ate must not be used in patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against the human scent factor VIII , mouse or ham@@ ster protein or any of the other components .
in March 2004 , the European Commission appointed the company Ba@@ x@@ ter AG appro@@ ving a permit for inclusion of Adv@@ ate in the entire European Union .
dosage The dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution therapy set up according to the sever@@ ity of the factor VIII , according to the place and extent of the blood and the clinical state of the patient .
in the following hem@@ o@@ rh@@ em@@ ic events , the factor VIII in the corresponding period should not sink down under the specified plastic bricks ( in % of the standard or in i.e. / d@@ l ) .
inj@@ ections every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repe@@ ating until the pain and acute impair@@ ment are eliminated .
inj@@ ections every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the risk exceeds the patient .
during the treatment of treatment it is recommended to control the inj@@ ectable dose and the frequency of inj@@ ections a proper determination of the factor VIII @-@ plasma cutting .
individual patients may differ in their reaction to factor VIII , different in vi@@ vo Recovery and have different half @-@ times .
3 proph@@ yla@@ xis in long @-@ term proph@@ yla@@ xis in patients with severe h@@ amm@@ ophi@@ lia A should be doses aged between 20 and 40 , by factor VIII per kg body weight in the distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VIII @-@ plasma activities cannot be reached or if the ble@@ eding is not controlled with a reasonable dose , a test must be carried out to prove a inhibit@@ or .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective so other therapeutic interventions need to be weigh@@ ed .
the appointments should be directed after the treatment of the patient , whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alised antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with H@@ äm@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ator@@ ical activity by factor VIII , Ig@@ G immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma by modi@@ fying Be@@ thes@@ da As@@ say .
developing the risk , inhibit@@ ors to develop , cor@@ relate with the extent of exposure to the factor VIII , whereby the risk within the first 20 Ex@@ cer@@ os stage is on the largest and of genetic and other factors .
in case @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with over 100 extran@@ et and an@@ am@@ nest@@ y of inhibit@@ ors , according to the change@@ over from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product to another , the re@@ moves of ( lower ) inhibit@@ ors .
due to the rare appearance of the h@@ amm@@ ophi@@ lia A in women lie on the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and l@@ ac@@ tation .
the A@@ DR@@ s &apos;s largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) , which appeared in previously un@@ treated patients who have a higher risk to the formation of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( each 3 patients ) .
very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency on the basis of available data not removable ) .

based on the data available since the initial data transfer , the CH@@ MP is continuing to assess the benefits of risk assessment , but considering that the safety profile for the following reasons must be closely monitored :
therefore , the CH@@ MP is on the basis of the security code of A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE , which makes a filing of PS@@ UR@@ s every 6 months required , decided that the eligi@@ bility holder should apply for another five years .
December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited announces the Committee on Human Development ( CH@@ MP ) officially that the company will withdraw his request for approval for the processing of Adv@@ oc@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
normally , however , the breast , the brain , the bones , or the cros@@ sover ( tissue , the other structures in the body connects , surrounds and rel@@ ies ) of it .
this is a type of virus that &apos;s gene@@ tically modified so that it can carry out a gene into the cells of the body .
the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus , &quot; that has changed so that there cannot be copies of themselves and therefore cannot trigger infections in humans .
Adv@@ oc@@ in could have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and thus allow cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein , which is made of the not broken in the human body existing p@@ 53 gene , usually contributes to the restoration of corrupt DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA can not be restored .
at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i Cancer , in which the p@@ 53 gene is def@@ ective , the p@@ 53 protein is not working properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share .
the company presented data from a study with a patient before the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i Cancer in the field of under@@ mining , into the bones and the brain .
after the CH@@ MP asked the answers to the questions asked questions , there were still some questions un@@ solved .
based on the examination of initial documents submitted the CH@@ MP to tag 120 creates a list of questions that will be sent to the company .
according to the CH@@ MP was not sufficiently proven that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tum@@ ors brings benefits to patients .
the committee also had concerns about the processing of the medication by means of the body , type of administration , as well as the security of the medication .
in addition , the company had not sufficiently proven that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be produced in a reliable manner and that it is neither for the environment or for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the firm has not been aware of the CH@@ MP , whether the return consequences for patients currently participating in clinical studies or &quot; Comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changing realities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are so assembled that one of the effective components will be released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used for treating the symptoms of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( h@@ ay fever , applied by an allergy to pol@@ len inflammation of the nas@@ al passages ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling ( hidden nose ) .
for adults and young people aged 12 years , the recommended dose of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice daily , which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and ended as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nose @-@ s@@ mu@@ cos@@ a ( pet@@ op@@ ed nose ) .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medication can be scr@@ am@@ using on the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main measures were the changes of the heav@@ eg@@ ra@@ ids of the hypo@@ cris@@ y ymp@@ tom@@ ome that were reported by the patients prior to the start of treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study patients received their symptoms every 12 hours into a diary and rated with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
when considering all gras@@ shop@@ pers of ymp@@ tom@@ y except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose reported the patients , the Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , about an acceptance of symptoms around 4@@ 6.@@ 0 % , compared with 3@@ 5,@@ 9 % in the patients , the p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine alone .
if only the swelling of the nose @-@ s@@ mu@@ cos@@ a was seen , the patients showed under the aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze a alle@@ vi@@ ation of symptoms around 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients , the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine alone .
the most common side effects of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ mic ( cardi@@ ac disease ) , phar@@ yn@@ gi@@ tis , ant@@ or@@ ex@@ ia ( appetite , head@@ ache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ ability ) , sle@@ eve disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who may be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine or one of the other components , against ad@@ ren@@ aming agents or lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( a different medicine for the treatment of allergies ) are not applied .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may also not be used in patients suffering from a bott@@ len@@ ght ( high eye pressure ) , cardi@@ ac disease or v@@ ascular disease ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ ose ( over@@ function of the thy@@ roid ) or have already caused a hem@@ o@@ rh@@ ag@@ onian stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission appointed the company SP Europe granted approval for the in@@ traffic of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in the entire European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , however , is to swal@@ low in the whole ( that is , without cr@@ ashed or chew@@ ing ) .
the aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be applied to children under 12 years due to the failure of data for the ambig@@ u@@ ity and efficacy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the end of the symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the usage time on 10 days because in long @-@ term waste the activity of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine can decrease in time .
after decline of the swelling of the mu@@ cos@@ as in the upper air@@ ways the treatment can be continued with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine as mon@@ otherapy .
since aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine contains , the drug is also contra@@ sting in patients who are treated with a mon@@ o@@ am@@ in@@ oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) -@@ Hem@@ mer or within 2 weeks after completion of such therapy .
this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ e@@ tic activity in combined application of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ ct@@ ine , per@@ go@@ id , lan@@ erg@@ ine , cab@@ ine or nas@@ al , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ edr@@ ine , Ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ oline , Nap@@ haz@@ ard etc . ) .
the security and effectiveness of this combination therapy have not been tested for this patient collective , and the data will not be sufficient for the dosage .
the safety and effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dis@@ rup@@ ting and the data will not be sufficient for the dosage .
patients must be informed that treatment in the occurrence of hyper@@ tension or a t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ ite or from Pal@@ pit@@ ations , ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , nau@@ sea or any other neurological symptoms ( like head@@ aches or a rein@@ forcement of the head@@ aches ) must be set .
in the treatment of following patients groups , patients suffering from digital is • patients with cardi@@ ac disease • patients with hyper@@ tension • patients with hyper@@ tension • patients with a m@@ yo@@ k@@ ard@@ in@@ color in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bli@@ en@@ hal@@ os@@ stru@@ al stru@@ al stru@@ al stru@@ al stru@@ al stru@@ z@@ stru@@ al or bron@@ chi@@ ger@@ m in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is entitled at least 48 hours prior to performing der@@ mat@@ ological testing since anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ini@@ ka otherwise can prevent positive reactions to indicators for door@@ step or reduce their scale .
within the framework of clinical tests with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , where er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered , however , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma @-@ concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine were observed .
in the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or testing there were no significant differences between the patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and the patients treated with placebo @-@ treated patients regardless of whether des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was taken alone or with alcohol .
that for the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine responsible enzy@@ me has not yet been identified so that interactions with other drugs cannot be excluded completely .
des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in@@ hi@@ bits in @-@ vi@@ vo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 not , and in @-@ vit@@ ro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not in@@ hibit and neither a sub@@ strate nor a inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ Gly@@ kop@@ rot@@ eins .
the in@@ consistency of the use of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not guaranteed , experience from a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies , however , no increase in frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency at the normal population .
since re@@ production studies at animals are not always transmitted to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ ct@@ ory properties of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine should not be applied to aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in pregnancy .
however , patients should be raised about it that in very rare cases it can come to a ben@@ r@@ ity that can lead to a impair@@ ment of the traffic or the ability to operate machinery .
symptoms may vary between a Z@@ NS depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , dimin@@ ished mental attention , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , coron@@ ary cardiovascular collagen ) and a Z@@ NS stimulation ( ins@@ om@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ) with possible let@@ ins .

a Z@@ NS stimulation is particularly probable in children , just like A@@ trop@@ hi@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth @-@ dry , pl@@ up@@ ill@@ en@@ rigid and - di@@ lat@@ ation , bon@@ ther@@ ing , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gast@@ ro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro @-@ inflammat@@ ory cy@@ to@@ k@@ inen such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the Ad@@ hem@@ sion@@ sm@@ ol@@ ls P @-@ selection on endo@@ th@@ el@@ cells .
in a single dose study with adults showed Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg did not affect standard measuring sizes of the flu@@ ps , including the strengthening of subjective di@@ ligence or the tasks associated with flying .
in controlled clinical trials at the recommended dosage of 5 mg per day , no increased frequency of pun@@ ctu@@ ality in comparison to placebo .
the or@@ ale application of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in the recommended dosage can produce more person@@ om@@ im@@ e@@ tic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ or or manifestations of a Z@@ NS arousal .
it took 1,@@ 2@@ 48 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies the hi@@ stam@@ in@@ antagon@@ istic effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets , determined by the overall effect for the symptom ( except nas@@ al @-@ skin @-@ swelling ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the fluctu@@ ating effect , determined by the nose @-@ s@@ ligh@@ tening effect , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in regard to gender , age or ethnic affili@@ ation groups .
as part of a single dose study for the Pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine within 30 minutes of administration in the plasma .

as part of a pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ specialist study , which was carried out with the formulation as a tablet to healthy adult pro@@ ban@@ den , has been realized that four pro@@ ban@@ den des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is very rare .
a component Inter@@ action study shows that the exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine according to the sole gift of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in bio@@ equivalent was to exposure to G@@ abe an Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
based on conventional studies on security har@@ mac@@ ology , for toxicity in repeti@@ tive gift , to Gen@@ oto@@ x@@ icity and to re@@ producing sto@@ x@@ icity , the pre@@ clinical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine dis@@ agree with no particular dangers to humans .
the combination poss@@ essed no greater toxicity than their individual components , and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine .
in Re@@ duction sto@@ xi@@ ological studies the combination of Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in / p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was in the oral g@@ gles in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day not ter@@ ato@@ genic .
March 2007 and in Module 1.@@ 8.1 of the authorisation application has been established , drug @-@ vig@@ il@@ ance system is established and works before and while the product is on the market .

it is available as a 5 mg tablet , 5 m@@ g@@ - Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at for inser@@ tion ( soluble tablet ) , 2,5 m@@ g@@ - and 5 mg mel@@ ting tab@@ let@@ ins ( tablets that dis@@ solve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as 0,5 mg / ml solution .
for children from one to five years the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once daily , which in the form of 2.5 ml Sir@@ up b@@ z@@ w .
for children aged six to eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once daily , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup .
A@@ eri@@ us has been studied in a total of eight studies with about 4 800 adults and young people with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies at seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies of patients who also had as@@ thma ) .
the effectiveness was measured by changing the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the p@@ add@@ ling , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance in the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment .
further studies have been submitted to verify that the body uses the Sir@@ up , the solution to the inser@@ tion and the mel@@ ting tab@@ let@@ ins are used in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless .
in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us were at an average absorption of the symptom ( symptom score ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients , which received a placebo .
in both studies at Ur@@ tik@@ aria was the acceptance of the symptom after six @-@ week treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared to 40 and 33 % compared with placebo @-@ treated patients .
A@@ eri@@ us must not be used in patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine or any of the other components .
January 2001 , the European Commission adopted a approval for Inland A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union .
one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , to alle@@ vi@@ ate the symptoms in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mit@@ er and Persian allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there are limited experience of clinical trials to improve the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in young people from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of inter@@ acting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be carried out according to the previous illness . after the end of the symptoms , the symptoms occur and may be res@@ umed at their re @-@ occur .
in the Persian allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( appearance of symptoms at 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) can be recommended to patients during the aller@@ gen period .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions have not been observed in clinical studies with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in tablets during which Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clin@@ ically @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , at the same intake of as@@ eri@@ us and alcohol the powerful impact of alcohol is not strengthened ( see section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be raised about it that in very rare cases it can come to ben@@ r@@ ity , which can lead to a impair@@ ment of the modes of transport or the ability to operate machinery .
in clinical studies in different indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic judgments , were reported in the recommended dose of 5 mg per day 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , than in patients treated with placebo .
the most common side effects which was reported more frequently than with placebo , fatigue ( 1.2 % ) , mou@@ th@@ wash ( 0.@@ 8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0.@@ 6 % ) .
during a clinical study with 5@@ 78 adol@@ escent patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common side @-@ effect head@@ aches was treated with 5,@@ 9 % of patients who were treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and at 6.@@ 9 % of the patients treated with placebo .
in a multi@@ purpose dose , administered by up to 45 mg of di@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( nin@@ et@@ een clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
this includes both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro @-@ inflammat@@ ory cy@@ to@@ k@@ inen such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the no@@ hem@@ sion@@ sm@@ ol@@ ls P @-@ selection on endo@@ th@@ eli@@ al cells .
within the framework of a clinical study with multiple sclerosis , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , in a dosage of up to 20 mg per day , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clin@@ ically @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dosage of 45 mg per day ( the Ne@@ un @-@ clinical dose ) was administered over ten days showed no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c @-@ Inter@@ v@@ alls .
with an individual dos@@ is@@ - study with adults showed Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg did not affect standard measuring sizes of the flu@@ ps , including the strengthening of subjective di@@ ligence or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the alle@@ vi@@ ation of symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ch on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in sa@@ is@@ onal and Per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s can also be divided into dependence on the duration of the symptoms , alternatively in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and pers@@ ist allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
internal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
Persian allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as a occurrence of symptoms to 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
as shown by the overall effect of the questionnaire for the quality of life at Rhino con@@ jun@@ c@@ ti@@ vi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively dimin@@ ished the caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria was dep@@ rec@@ ated for further forms of the Ur@@ tik@@ aria , since the underlying path@@ ology regardless of the equ@@ ti@@ ology in the different forms is similar and chronic patients can become easier pro@@ spec@@ tively .
since the H@@ ist@@ am@@ in@@ fre@@ is@@ cation is a young factor in all ur@@ inary diseases , is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is expected to improve the symptoms in other forms of the Ur@@ tik@@ aria to improve the symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled studies about 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria was A@@ eri@@ us effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of p@@ add@@ les at the end of the first tin intervals .
as in other studies with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ini@@ ka with chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria , the minority of patients who are not based on anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ka re@@ acted from the study .
an improvement in the it@@ ching of more than 50 % was observed at 55 % of the patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in @-@ treated patients compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo @-@ treated patients .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the disorder of sleep and al@@ on@@ eness , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evaluating these variables .
in a pharmaceutical drug study , in which the patients were comparable with the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , at 4 % of patients reached a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
there are no clu@@ es for a clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation for once daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days before .
however , that for the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine responsible enzy@@ me has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines will not be excluded completely
des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in@@ hi@@ bits in @-@ vi@@ vo not C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vit@@ ro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not in@@ hibit and neither a sub@@ strate nor a inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ Gly@@ kop@@ rot@@ eins .
in a single dos@@ is@@ study with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dosage of 7.5 mg used meals ( fatty , low @-@ cal@@ orie breakfast ) not to the availability of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
the clinical studies conducted with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in carried out in clinical trials , at a comparable degree of exposure of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , no qualitative or quantitative differences in terms of toxicity of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
based on conventional studies for safety sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology , toxicity in repeti@@ tive casting , gen@@ oto@@ x@@ icity and to re@@ producing sto@@ x@@ icity , the pre@@ clinical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine dis@@ agree with no particular dangers to humans .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals to alle@@ vi@@ ate the symptoms in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mit@@ er and pers@@ ist allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the des@@ crip@@ tive doctor should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s are caused by an infection ( see under section 4.4 ) and that no data is available to support a treatment of infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion from upper brea@@ ths or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es should play a role in diagnos@@ ing the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical investigations and appropriate laboratory and skin examination .
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed di@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in limited and experienced a higher sub@@ stan@@ z@@ load ( see below 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up in children between 2 and 11 years that are restricted to met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed , is identical to that with children , who are normal met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed .
this medicine includes Sac@@ char@@ ose and Sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients should not occupy patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of a fru@@ ct@@ ose intolerance , glu@@ cose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose or a Sac@@ char@@ ase @-@ is@@ om@@ in@@ ad@@ in@@ ence of this medicine .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions have been observed within the framework of clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , where er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clin@@ ically @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , at simultaneous intake of A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol the powerful impact of alcohol is not ampli@@ fied ( see section 5.1 ) .
the overall prevalence of side @-@ side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up group , similar to the placebo group .
in clinical studies with adults and young people in different indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic judgments were reported in the recommended dose 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , than in patients treated with placebo .
in a multi@@ purpose dosage study of adults and adolescents , in which up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( nin@@ et@@ een @-@ day clinical dose ) have been administered and no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
children aged between 1 and 11 years , who came to an anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ine therapy , received a daily des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ind@@ osis of 1,@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic judgments and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adults and children are similar , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine can be regulated by adults on the children &apos;s population extr@@ ap@@ o@@ amer@@ ica .
within the framework of a clinical study with multi@@ plying to adults and young people , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dosage of up to 20 mg per day over 14 days has been applied no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect .
in a clin@@ ically @-@ pharmac@@ ological study on adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dosage of 45 mg per day ( the Ne@@ un @-@ clinical dose ) was applied for ten days at adults , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c @-@ Inter@@ v@@ alls .
in controlled clinical trials at the recommended dosage of 5 mg per day for adults and teenagers , no increased frequency of pun@@ ctu@@ ality in comparison to placebo .
in a single daily dose of 7.5 mg led A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical studies no impair@@ ment of the Psych@@ omot@@ or .
in clin@@ ically @-@ pharmac@@ ological studies of adults it came through the simultaneous intake of alcohol neither to a strengthening of alcohol induc@@ tive power .
in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in the alle@@ vi@@ ation of symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ch on the palate .
as shown by the overall effect of the questionnaire for the quality of life at Rhino con@@ jun@@ c@@ ti@@ vi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively dimin@@ ished by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
in two placebo @-@ controlled studies about 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria was A@@ eri@@ us effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of p@@ add@@ les at the end of the first tin intervals .
the spread of this restricted phen@@ otyp@@ e phen@@ otyp@@ e was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than at Kau@@ k@@ asi@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ o@@ wi@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with the sy@@ r@@ arity in children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , which is restricted to met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed .
the burden ( AU@@ C ) by des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in was after 3 to 6 hours about 6@@ times higher and the C@@ max about 3 to 4@@ times higher with a termin@@ al half @-@ time of approximately 120 hours .
there are no clu@@ es for a clin@@ ically relevant active ingredient g@@ rief after once daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In various single dose studies showed that AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ max values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients were comparable with those of recommended doses with those of adults , the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in Sir@@ up in a dosage of 5 mg .

this medicine contains Sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients should not take patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of a fru@@ ct@@ ose intolerance , glu@@ cose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose or a Sac@@ char@@ ase @-@ is@@ om@@ in@@ suff@@ ency of this medicine .
the overall prevalence of side @-@ effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in group , similar to the placebo group .
in small children between 6 and 23 months the most common side effects were reported via the more frequently than placebo , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( 3,@@ 7 % ) , fever ( 2.3 % ) and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness ( 2.3 % ) .
an additional study were observed in an additional study of 2.5 mg des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine solution for inser@@ tion no side @-@ effects in patients aged between 6 and 11 years .
at the recommended doses the plasma @-@ concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( see under section 5.2 ) in the children &apos;s and adult population is comparable .
in controlled clinical trials at the recommended dosage of 5 mg per day for adults and teenagers , no increased frequency of pun@@ ctu@@ ality in comparison to placebo .
in addition to the established classification in sa@@ is@@ onal and Per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may vary depending on the duration of the symptoms alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and
as shown by the overall effect of the questionnaire for the quality of life at Rhino con@@ jun@@ c@@ ti@@ vi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
the spread of this restricted phen@@ otyp@@ e phen@@ otyp@@ e was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than at Kau@@ k@@ asi@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
since A@@ eri@@ us solution for inser@@ ting the same concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine contains , there was no bio@@ equivalent study , and it is expected that it matches the Sir@@ up and the tablets .
in various single dose studies showed that AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ max values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients were comparable to those recommended doses with those of adults , the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in Sir@@ up in a dosage of 5 mg .

in June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. the Committee for Human Development ( CH@@ MP ) officially launched its application for approval for In@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to prevent the avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influenza in adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect the flu , which is caused by the tribe ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influenza A virus .
this is a special kind of vaccine that could cause a trunk of Gri@@ p@@ pe@@ virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new tribe of the Gri@@ p@@ pe@@ virus emerges , which can easily spread from man to person because people do not have immunity ( no protection ) against it .
after administration of the vaccine , the immune system det@@ ects the parts of the grip @-@ virus as a &quot; body @-@ foreign &quot; and forms antibodies against it .
thus the immune system is able to form faster antibodies in contact with a grip @-@ virus of this pedi@@ ms .
subsequently , the membran@@ es of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which recognizes the human body as physical alien ) , un@@ matched and used as a component of the vaccine .
inspection of some of the study entr@@ es showed that the study was not conducted according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
thus , the scope of the clinical data base for the evaluation of the safety of the vaccine is not made to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for preventive vaccines .
if you are interested in a clinical trial and require further information regarding your treatment please contact your doctor .
for more information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) .
it is applied in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years that are caused by human immun@@ o@@ weaker virus from type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which are caused by the acquired immun@@ os@@ yn@@ iciency Syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , it is available as a solution to pick up , but these cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the security of this combination has not been studied .
a@@ gener@@ ase should only be assessed when the doctor has examined , which anti@@ viral medicines has been taken before , and the lik@@ eli@@ hood has asser@@ ted that the virus is addressed to the drug .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which will be taken along with twice daily 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medicines .
in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of a@@ gener@@ ase is aimed after body weight .
a@@ gener@@ ase is reduced when combined with other anti@@ viral medicines the HIV crowd in the blood and keeps them at a low level .
AIDS does not cure , however , can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also delay the development of associated infections and diseases .
A@@ gener@@ ase was examined in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , however without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ esters .
this reinforced with low do@@ si@@ sted Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r enhanced drug A@@ gener@@ ase was taken at 20@@ 6 adults , which had previously been prot@@ rac@@ ers earlier , with other prot@@ rac@@ ers .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the proportion of patients with non @-@ breaking concentr@@ ations of HIV in the blood ( Vir@@ us@@ last ) or the change in Vir@@ us@@ last after treatment .
in the studies involving patients who previously had no prot@@ esters had been taken under A@@ gener@@ ase more patients a Vir@@ us@@ last among 400 copies / ml than on placebo but a@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children reduced A@@ gener@@ ase , the Vir@@ us@@ last , although were treated by the children who were treated earlier with Prot@@ ect dents , very few of the treatment said .
in the study with adults who had been treated earlier with Prot@@ eas@@ ed drugs , the Vir@@ us@@ last increase was just as effective as other prot@@ rac@@ ers after 16 @-@ week treatment :
in patients with HIV , which was resist@@ ent against four other prot@@ eas@@ ers , it came under A@@ gener@@ ase along with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger waste of the Vir@@ us@@ last after four weeks than with the patient who continues to have their previous prot@@ esters :
the most common side effects of an@@ gener@@ ase ( observed with more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , flat sea ( nau@@ sea ) , v@@ om@@ iting , rash and f@@ ati@@ gue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against am@@ a@@ avi@@ r or one of the other components .
a@@ gener@@ ase may also not be used in patients suffering from cur@@ rants ( a herbal supplement to treat depression ) or drugs that are as well as ast@@ er@@ ase and are harmful to high concentr@@ ations in the blood of health .
as with other medicines for HIV , the an@@ gener@@ ase is taking into account the risk of an Li@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , one oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose ( symptoms of bone tissue ) or an immun@@ o@@ activation syn@@ dro@@ ms ( symptoms of an infection which are caused by the recovered immune system ) .
the Committee for Human Development ( CH@@ MP ) to conclude that the benefits of a@@ generic medicines used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines used to treat HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken along with the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic amplifier , but the Committee established that the use of an@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who have previously won &apos;t have been proven before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally approved under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as at the time of approval for scientific reasons , limited information is limited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
October 2000 , the European Commission presented the Gla@@ xo Group company Limited permit permission for In@@ gener@@ ase in the entire European Union .
an@@ gener@@ ase is available in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1@@ - infected , prototyp@@ ing adult and children from 4 years old .
for usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are to be administered for the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic boobs of am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance resistance and the pre @-@ treatment of the patient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ a@@ avi@@ r as a solution to inc@@ and@@ ing is less than 14 % lower than from Am@@ ra@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , are an@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution to inser@@ tion on a milli@@ grams per milli@@ gram basis not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg Am@@ bit@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the ampli@@ fying commitment of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ bs ) , higher doses must be applied to a@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg Am@@ bit@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg Am@@ ti@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the pharmaceuticals , efficacy and safety of an@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ esters have not been studied in children .
in@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age , due to the mis@@ sal of data for in@@ consistency and effectiveness ( see Section 5.2 ) .
based on the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic data the dosage should be reduced to A@@ gener@@ ase capsules in adult patients with medium @-@ he@@ avi@@ or liver distur@@ b on 450 mg twice daily and in patients with heavy liver function to be reduced to 300 mg twice daily .
the simultaneous application is to be done in patients with mild or even liver distur@@ b@@ ance with caution , in patients with severe liver function , it is contra@@ sting ( see section 4.3 ) .
a@@ gener@@ ase may not be given simultaneously with medicines that possess a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzy@@ me 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal supplements which contain cur@@ rants ( hyper@@ icum per@@ for@@ atum ) , may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentr@@ ations and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of am@@ a@@ avi@@ r during the intake of amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be noted that a@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of an HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including the treatment with an@@ gener@@ ase prevents the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
should usually be applied A@@ gener@@ ase capsules along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hep@@ atitis B or C and are treated with an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy , have an increased risk for heavy liver effects with potentially deadly disease .
for the event of simultaneous viral treatment of hep@@ atitis B or C please read the relevant information of this medicine .
patients with pre @-@ existing monitoring function including a chronic @-@ active hep@@ atitis show an increased frequency of liver dys@@ functions under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ tic@@ ason or other glu@@ cose cor@@ es , it is not recommended that the potential benefits of a treatment is associated with the risk of systemic cor@@ tical effects including Mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of the tri@@ ni@@ cal function ( see Section 4.5 ) .
as the metabolism of the H@@ M@@ G @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduction Hem@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ vast@@ atin strongly depends on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , becomes a simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ vast@@ atin because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ sen .
4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , like Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ular Ratio ) , methods are available for determining the substance concentration .
in patients who are taking these medicines at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase can be less effective because of reduced plas@@ m@@ ics in am@@ a@@ vi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of met@@ abolic interactions with Am@@ ro@@ vi@@ r can be the effectiveness of hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills , however the information is not sufficient to cher@@ ish the type of interactions .
when meth@@ ad@@ one is given simultaneously with Am@@ ti@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ i@@ at@@ ent@@ ment symptoms , especially if also low doses are administered by Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
because of the potential risk of toxicity due to the high prop@@ yl@@ ch@@ y@@ col@@ ge@@ ance of the a@@ gener@@ ase solution for inclusion , this Dar@@ reich@@ ungs@@ form is contra@@ sted in children under a age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups .
dis@@ gener@@ ase should be placed on duration 5 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms , or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in patients , which received an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ rac@@ ers , was reported on the appearance of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia or an extr@@ ater@@ restri@@ al of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other diseases , to their therapy medicines that were necessary with the development of a diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or a hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
B. higher age , and with drug addiction factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and the associated met@@ abolic disorders , associated with .
at h@@ amm@@ op@@ hil@@ es patients ( type A and B ) , which were treated with Prot@@ ectors , reports of an increase of ble@@ eding including spontaneous k@@ ut@@ aner ha@@ em@@ ome and hem@@ ost@@ eo@@ arthritis .
in HIV infected patients with serious immune def@@ ective can develop an inflammat@@ ory reaction to as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections that leads to severe clinical states or deterioration of symptoms .
although a multi @-@ fact@@ orial equ@@ ti@@ ology is adopted ( including the use of cor@@ n@@ ost@@ ero@@ ids , alcohol consumption , heavy immune diseases , higher body mass index ) , were reported cases of Oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose especially in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeu@@ tical width a@@ gener@@ ase may not be given simultaneously with medicines that possess a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzy@@ me 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeu@@ tical width as@@ ymp@@ h with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be confused with medicines whose active ingredients are produced mainly via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are connected to the increased plas@@ m@@ ics with hard@@ est and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in has caused a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ ti@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and lead to a resistance development .
in the attempt to compens@@ ate the lower plastic wrap through a dosage increase of other prot@@ ector inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very frequently unwanted effects on the liver have been observed .
Johann@@ is@@ k@@ wort ( hyper@@ icum per@@ for@@ atum ) The Ser@@ um mirror of am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r can be humili@@ ated by the simultaneous application of herbal preparations with cur@@ rants ( hyper@@ icum per@@ for@@ atum ) .
if a patient begins already Johann@@ is@@ k@@ wort , the am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r@@ ting mirror and , if possible to review the Vir@@ us@@ last and to enforce the cur@@ rant .
a dosage adjustment for one of the medicine is not required if clo@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with Am@@ ti@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
5@@ 08 % increases , for C@@ max on the other hand by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with Am@@ bit@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical studies , doses of 600 mg of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice were applied twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , which occupy the effectiveness and in@@ consistency of this treatment reg@@ imen .
52 % humili@@ ates when Am@@ ti@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ ti@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Knights ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg of k@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
a dosage intake for simultaneous administration of Am@@ ro@@ vi@@ r and Cal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , it is recommended a tigh@@ tly monitoring , because the effectiveness and in@@ consistency of this combination is not known .
there was no pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic study carried out in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine , but is recommended due to the imagin@@ ative component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , however , that the revenue of di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine and a@@ gener@@ ase is at least an hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) .
therefore , at the gift of E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ ti@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dosage adjustment is required .
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ ti@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ eas@@ ers would be low .
the effect of Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ in on other prot@@ eas@@ ers and existing limited data may susp@@ ect that Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ in the Ser@@ um@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation of Am@@ bit@@ avi@@ r might be sen@@ sed .
if these drugs should be used at the same time , caution is advisable because Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din could be less effective because of the decreased and possibly sub@@ therapeutic plas@@ m@@ ics could be less effective .
when these medicines are used together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be made , as a precise predi@@ ction of the effect of the combination of am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
the simultaneous fig@@ ment of am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to a rise in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) of Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 193 % and thus an increase of the side @-@ related side effects associated with ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , becomes a reduction in the dosage of Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data is available .
pharmaceutical Studies with A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not carried out , however , the plas@@ m@@ ics of both medicines could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily lead to an increase in C@@ max of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole compared to the value which was observed after 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily without simultaneous application of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines that are listed below are also sub@@ str@@ ates , Hem@@ mer or in@@ duction of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , if they are applied together with as@@ gener@@ ase , possibly at interactions .
patients should therefore be linked to toxic reactions , which are associated with these medicines , if they are applied in combination with aging .
based on the data of other prot@@ eas@@ ers it is advisable that An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da is not taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase because it can come to res@@ or@@ tion disorders .
the simultaneous application of anti@@ conv@@ ul@@ si@@ va , which are known as enzymes ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in ) , with Am@@ ro@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degra@@ dation of the plas@@ m@@ alls of Am@@ ro@@ vi@@ r .
the Ser@@ um concentr@@ ations of calcium can@@ al@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , Dil@@ en@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ os@@ pin pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin pin , Ni@@ der@@ pin pin , N@@ ins@@ ulator and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by Am@@ bl@@ avi@@ r . thus , possibly the activity and toxicity of these medicines will be increased .
the simultaneous ing@@ esting with as@@ ap@@ ase can considerably increase their plasma concentr@@ ations with PD@@ E@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in connection with side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ ting , visual dys@@ functions and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days on promot@@ ers were significantly higher , while the endo@@ genic cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l rose by about 86 % of the tank interval 82 to 89 % ) .
consequently , the simultaneous fig@@ ment of A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended along with these glu@@ cose ra@@ ids , unless the potential benefits of treatment of systemic coron@@ ary cor@@ tical effects ( see Section 4.4 ) .
at H@@ M@@ G @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduction inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and sim@@ vast@@ atin , whose compar@@ isons depends heavily by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are pronounced enhancements of the plas@@ m@@ ics in simultaneous administration of an@@ gener@@ ase .
since Plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ vot@@ ings of these H@@ M@@ G @-@ Co@@ A reduction shirts can lead to My@@ opath@@ y including a R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ sis , the combined application of these medicines is not recommended with am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r .
it will be a prevalent monitoring of the therapeutic concentr@@ ations up to stabili@@ zation of the mirror , as the Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ations of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased in simultaneous gift of am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase can not be applied together with oral bi@@ ased Mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) , while in the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase is offered with par@@ ent@@ alem Mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am caution .
data on the simultaneous application of par@@ ent@@ alem Mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am with other prot@@ ers inhibit@@ ors to a possible increase in plasma cutting bar of Mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am by 3 to 4 @-@ fold .
when meth@@ ad@@ on is administered together with Am@@ ti@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ i@@ at@@ ent@@ ment symptoms , especially if also low doses are administered by Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
because of the per se low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , there is currently no recommendation to be given as the Am@@ ti@@ avi@@ r@@ - dose to adapt simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ on simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ on .
with simultaneous gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with map@@ ase , an increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular ratio ) is recommended because of the possibility of dis@@ abling or rein@@ forcement of anti@@ thro@@ om effects ( see section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills cannot be predicted , therefore , alternative methods are recommended for contrac@@ eption .
a careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended in simultaneous gift of a@@ gener@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .

many of these events are not clari@@ fied whether they are applied in connection with the intake of as@@ gener@@ ase or another at the same time to HIV treatment , or whether they are a result of the under@@ mining disease .
most of the side @-@ mentioned side effects are taken from two clinical studies ( PRO@@ AB@@ 3@@ 001 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which with prototyp@@ ing patients were not treated 1200 mg A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily .

the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 @-@ algorithm for Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of the mut@@ ations of V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ A / L / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / F / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V / V ) .
the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to changes through additional data , and it is recommended to always use the current interpre@@ tations for analy@@ zing the results of resistance testing .
on phenomenal resistance analysis laboratories in conjunction with the prototyp@@ ical data for de@@ valu@@ ation of the activity of Am@@ ti@@ vi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ers @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
companies that distribute diagnostic resistance tests , have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phenomenal cut @-@ off@@ s ( partition points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be applied to interpretation of results of a resistance testing .
each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to am@@ a@@ avi@@ r Associ@@ ated genetic patterns generates a certain cr@@ ashes against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ le@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved .
there are currently data for cross @-@ resist@@ ence between Am@@ bit@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ rac@@ ers for all 4 Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r resistance , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
based on twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ spective patients , with which a Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , Dar@@ un@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , Dar@@ un@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ qu@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
the other way round , Am@@ bit@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ esters @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the preservation of these activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
early departure of a reconc@@ iling therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in boundaries that can affect the subsequent treatment .
the cover of the effectiveness of arom@@ a@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study ( Vir@@ us@@ last ≥ 1000 copies per day ) and nuclear therapy ( standard of care , so@@ C ) with a PI , primarily with low g@@ do@@ si@@ ru@@ b cr@@ r .
one hundred and thre@@ es@@ thre@@ es@@ thre@@ es@@ sev@@ enty ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least one other PI and at least one NR@@ TI were included in the partial study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis presented the non @-@ sub @-@ superi@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the time @-@ ad@@ owed of the output ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in Vir@@ us@@ last ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , at a non @-@ sub @-@ shaft of 0.@@ 4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the proof of the effectiveness of un@@ bund@@ led A@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled studies with a total of 2@@ 88 HIV infected children aged 2 to 18 years , of which 152 were treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ gener@@ ase solution to take and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
it was not given a low do@@ si@@ sted Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the NR@@ TI@@ s together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of the patients included a plasma @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml at a medi@@ an increase in the CD@@ 4 cell number of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value .
19 Basi@@ l on this data should be taken into consideration when treatment @-@ treated children of the expected benefits of &quot; un@@ bund@@ ling &quot; a@@ gener@@ ase .
after oral administration , the average duration ( t@@ max ) is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
5@@ 08 % increases , for C@@ max on the other hand reduced by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) along with Am@@ bit@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of Am@@ ti@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % discount of AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ bit@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimum concentration in the ste@@ ady state ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ influenced by the food intake , although the simultaneous food intake affects the scale and rate of res@@ or@@ ption .
the seem@@ ing distribution volume is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg for a weight weight of 70 kg ) and leaves on a large distribution volume as well as an enormous penetration by am@@ a@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissues close .
this change leads to a decrease in the overall concentration of the substance in the plasma , whereby the amount of un@@ born am@@ a@@ avi@@ r which represents the active part , probably remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bund@@ ling Am@@ bit@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage percentage of free active component during the duration of use of the total medical practitioner in the ste@@ ady state over the range of C@@ max , ss up to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must indu@@ ce or in@@ hi@@ ve or a sub@@ strate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 to be administered with caution when they are given simultaneously with aging ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the Gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg times daily , leads to a similar daily am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily .
Am@@ stress@@ avi@@ r is available from the solution 14 % less bio@@ available than from the capsules ; therefore are a@@ gener@@ ase solution and a@@ gener@@ ase capsules are ex@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram basis .
the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r neg@@ li@@ gible , therefore the impact of ren@@ al function is likely to be low on the elimination of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
this treatment schem@@ ata lead to am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r @-@ plasma cutting , comparable to those that are obtained from healthy prob@@ es after a dose of 1200 mg of Am@@ bit@@ avi@@ r twice daily without simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on the edge of co@@ ver@@ ogen@@ r on mice and rats , in case of male animals en@@ ig@@ ne hep@@ at@@ ell@@ ular Aden@@ omes in doses at dos@@ ages ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - kind@@ le ( rat ) of exposure to men , after twice daily com@@ mu@@ te of 1200 mg Am@@ bit@@ avi@@ r , languages .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of the hep@@ at@@ cellular Aden@@ omes and car@@ cin@@ oma were not yet un@@ solved and the relevance of these observed effects for the human being is unclear .
from these expos@@ ures data to humans , both from clinical studies as well as from the therapeutic application , however , there are little evidence of accepting a clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and In @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ Gen@@ oto@@ x@@ iz@@ ational tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , mouse @-@ l@@ ymp@@ ho@@ m test , included in rats and chromos@@ ome gra@@ zing in human periph@@ eral l@@ ymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , was Am@@ bit@@ avi@@ r neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ oto@@ x@@ ic .
this liver tox@@ ics can be monitored and proven in clinical daily life by measuring A@@ ST , AL@@ T and the activity of al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ or@@ us .
so far in clinical studies have not been observed any significant liver tox@@ ic@@ ation in patients , either during the administration of an@@ gener@@ ase or after the end of treatment .
studies on the toxicity in juven@@ iles , which were treated at an age of 4 days showed both in the control and in the animals of the animal temper@@ ament @-@ treated animals a high mortality .
in a systemic plasma cutting , which was significant among ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure to therapeu@@ tical dosage among men , however , a number of minor changes including Th@@ y@@ mus@@ el@@ ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ et@@ alter@@ ations were observed , which point to a delayed development .
24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the ampli@@ fying commitment of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ bs ) , higher doses must be applied to a@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg Am@@ bit@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg Am@@ ti@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the simultaneous application is to be done in patients with more vig@@ il@@ ant or easier liver function with caution , in patients with severe liver function , it is contra@@ sted ( see section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , like Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ular Ratio ) , methods are available for determining the substance concentration .
dis@@ gener@@ ase should be placed on duration 27 when a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms , or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk for a light pod@@ ystro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug addiction factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and the associated met@@ abolic disorders .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in has caused a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ ti@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and lead to a resistance development .
5@@ 08 % increases , for C@@ max on the other hand by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with Am@@ bit@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .

a dosage intake for simultaneous administration of Am@@ ro@@ vi@@ r and Cal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , it is recommended a tigh@@ tly monitoring , because the effectiveness and in@@ consistency of this combination is not known .
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ ti@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ eas@@ ers would be low .
when these medicines are used together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be made , as a precise predi@@ ction of the effect of the combination of am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , becomes a reduction in the dosage of Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although there are no clinical data .
the Ser@@ um concentr@@ ations of calcium can@@ al@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , Dil@@ en@@ az@@ em , Rocky pin , Nic@@ ardi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin pin , Ni@@ der@@ pin pin , N@@ ins@@ ulator and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by Am@@ bit@@ avi@@ r , thus increasing the activity and toxicity of these medicines .

with simultaneous gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with map@@ ase , an increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular ratio ) is recommended because of the possibility of dis@@ abling or rein@@ forcement of anti@@ thro@@ om effects ( see section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of Orth@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.@@ 0@@ 35 mg E@@ thin@@ yl@@ est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1,@@ 0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ ind@@ ron ) led to a decrease in the AU@@ C and C@@ min by Am@@ bl@@ avi@@ r by 22 % b@@ z@@ w .

the cream is dil@@ uted in front of the bedroom , so that they have enough long ( about eight hours ) on the skin before it is washed off .
in all studies Al@@ dara was compared with a placebo ( same cream , but without the substance ) . • Al@@ dara was tested in four main studies on 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks .
the main inde@@ b@@ ator for the effectiveness was the number of patients with complete precip@@ itation of the treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dara was also examined in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell disease in two studies where patients were treated six weeks and al@@ dara or placebo either daily or five times a week .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the number of patients with complete precip@@ itation of tum@@ ors after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dara was also tested in two studies in a total of 5@@ 05 patients with acute ker@@ at@@ osis .
in all studies Al@@ dara were more effective than placebo . • In the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area , the full settlement rate was collected from 66 % to 80 % in the patients with Al@@ dara treated patients compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group .

the calculated half @-@ time period was about 10@@ times higher than the 2@@ hour half @-@ time after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in a previous study ; this indicates a prolonged Ret@@ ention of the medication in the skin .
the data for the systemic exposure showed that the Res@@ or@@ ption application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was low to topical application of patients aged 6 - 12 years and comparable to that with healthy adults and adults with acute ker@@ at@@ osis or super@@ vis@@ c@@ ine cell disease .
in a four @-@ month study for der@@ mal toxicity in the rat led doses from 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg . kg to significantly dimin@@ ished body weight and increased sp@@ le@@ en weight ; one likewise four months run through the der@@ mal application turned out with the mouse no similar effects .
a two @-@ year study on car@@ cin@@ ity of mice with mice in case of mice at three days a week in@@ duced no tum@@ ors at the use of the application .
the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a small systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ ed , a risk to man is due to systemic exposure to very low .
the tumor occurred in the group of mice treated with the real @-@ free cream , formerly and in greater numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for the enzy@@ me therapy in patients with secured diagnosis of a Mu@@ kop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ ot I ( M@@ PS I ; α @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the not neurological manifestations of the disease ( symptoms which cannot be associated with brain or nerves ) .
this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ ca@@ ic@@ ans , G@@ ags ) will not be dismant@@ led and thus accum@@ ulate in most organs in the body and damaging it .
the following not neurological symptoms of the M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , sti@@ ff joints , the movements complain , decreased pul@@ mon@@ ary volume , heart - and eye diseases .
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary met@@ abolic disorders .
the administration of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be done in a hospital or clinic with re@@ bu@@ oy@@ ancy devices , and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to administration , to prevent an allergic reaction .

in the study , mainly the security of the medicine was examined , however , it was also measured by its effectiveness ( by investig@@ ating its effect regarding the reduction of the G@@ AG concentr@@ ations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) .
in children under five years of sen@@ tim@@ az@@ y@@ me the G@@ AG concentr@@ ations in the urine around 60 % , and half of the treated children pointed to the end of the study a normal large liver .
the most common side effects of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed with more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ ache , nau@@ sea , stomach pain , pain , pain , pain in the li@@ mbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat feeling , fever and reactions at the in@@ fusion station .
very common side effects in patients under five years are heigh@@ tened blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement size of the lung function ) , T@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ an ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and sho@@ ok .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients who may be strongly over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or one of the other components ( an@@ aphy@@ l@@ actic reaction ) , not to be applied .
the European Chemicals Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will be updated every year with all new information that may be known to check and update this summary .
the maker of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will be patient to watch the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , as regards the reactions to the in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission elected Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. is a permit for In@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in the entire European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using Ch@@ o @-@ mam@@ mal @-@ cell cultures ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ vary , Ei@@ er@@ stock des Chinese Ham@@ sters ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is for long @-@ time enzymes in patients with secured diagnosis of a Mu@@ kop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ ot I ( M@@ PS I , α @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neurological manifestations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be done by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can , if the patient is wearing this , every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and effectiveness of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years was not determined and for these patients can not be recommended a dosage scheme .
safety and effectiveness of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver in@@ suff@@ solven@@ cy was not determined and for these patients can not be recommended a dosage scheme .
with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated patients can develop in@@ fusion @-@ conditional reactions , which are defined as any given by side effect , which occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be monitored carefully , and the in@@ fusion of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be done only in a proper clinical environment in which re@@ bu@@ oy@@ ancy devices are immediately available for medical emergen@@ cies .
due to the clinical phase @-@ 3 study , we expect almost all patients of Ig@@ G antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the start of treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when applying Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with caution ( see sections 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
as little experience exists in respect of the treatment after a longer break , due to the theoretical risk of an over@@ sensitive reaction after a break of treatment must be cau@@ tious .
60 minutes before the beginning of in@@ fusion with medication ( anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ine and / or anti@@ Py@@ re@@ tics ) to minimize the potential of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
in the event of a light or moderate in@@ fusion reaction , treatment with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ine and par@@ agli@@ amo@@ l / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be weigh@@ ed and / or a reduction in in@@ fusion rate to half the in@@ fusion rate , in which the reaction occurred .
in case of a single , heavy in@@ fusion reaction , the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are brought to decrease , treatment with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ine and par@@ agli@@ amo@@ l / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered .
in@@ fusion can be added again with a reduction in in@@ fusion rate at 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate when the reaction occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ine and par@@ aphr@@ amo@@ l / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ) as well as a reduction in in@@ fusion rate at 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of in@@ fusion rate , in which the previous reaction occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be applied simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or Proc@@ ain because a potential risk of interference with in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular intake consists of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
veterinary studies do not leave direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , the embryo / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
since no data on new@@ bor@@ ns which were expon@@ ential to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase over the mother &apos;s milk , is advised to satisfy during the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
the side effects in clinical studies have been predominantly examined as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions , which were observed in 53 % of patients in phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and at 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) .
unwanted medication acts associated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me that were observed during the phase 3 years or older during a duration of 45 years or older during a treatment duration of up to 4 years , are listed in the following table according to the following frequencies : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related participation of the upper air@@ ways and lungs in the history , there were heavy reactions to , including bronze pas@@ ism , respiratory and facial ( see section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ er@@ desired pharmaceutical effects associated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a Ph@@ as@@ - 2 @-@ study with a total of 20 patients aged 5 years , with predominantly severe delays and treatment duration up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 kg / kg intraven@@ ously weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
in most patients it came within 3 months after the start of the treatment to a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version , with the patient at the age of 5 years with a he@@ avier decay times ( average after 26 days over 45 days in patients aged 5 years and older ) .
until the end of phase 3 @-@ 3 study ( or up to a premature departure from the study ) , 13 / 45 patients were not entitled to proph@@ esi@@ ble antibodies ( R@@ IP ) ass@@ ay ass@@ ail@@ able antibodies against , including 3 patients , where there has never been to ser@@ o@@ con@@ version .
patients with lack of blood circulation are a robust reduction of G@@ AG &apos;s spi@@ der in Har@@ n , while in patients with high anti @-@ em@@ bodi@@ ments a variable reduction of G@@ AG in the har@@ n was to be as@@ cer@@ tained .
four patients ( three in the phase @-@ 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a mar@@ g@@ inal to small neutral effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ - activity in vit@@ ro , which seemed to imp@@ air the clinical effectiveness and / or the reduction of G@@ AG in the har@@ n .
the presence of antibodies seemed to stand in connection with the incidence of und@@ es@@ irable drug action , even if the appearance of und@@ es@@ irable drug actions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies in time .
the ration@@ ale for the enzy@@ me therapy is in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accum@@ ulated sub@@ strate and the prevention of further accumulation of adequate recovery of the enzymes .
after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly taken from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the Ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely about Mann@@ ing @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
the safety and effectiveness of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a random@@ ized , double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo@@ arding phase 3 @-@ 3 study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study that were calculated the entire disease spectrum was the majority of patients from the middle phen@@ otyp@@ e and only a patient pointed the heavy phen@@ otyp@@ e .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a for@@ ci@@ zed explicit volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end @-@ points for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute walking path in the 6 @-@ min@@ ut@@ e- sal@@ ary test .
all patients were subsequently cr@@ ush@@ ed for an open label study , where they received another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) each week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
after 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated patients to the placebo group is an improvement in the lung function and the in@@ capacity shown in the table below .
in the open reference study , an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects showed up to 208 weeks in der@@ Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and of 182 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as follows from the table below .
the decrease of the expected percentage FE@@ V is not significant over this period of clin@@ ically not significant and the absolute lung volumes increased further proportional to the height of growing children .
from 26 patients with a hep@@ atitis B prior to treatment 22 ( 85 % ) to the end of the study a normal liver size .
within the first 4 weeks a clear waste of the G@@ AG mirror in the har@@ n ( µ@@ g / mg cre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) established , which remained constant at the end of the study .
in regard to hetero@@ geneous health care , between the patients suffering by the use of a combined end result , the clin@@ ically significant changes are summar@@ ised for five efficacy issues ( expected percentage of the deb@@ tor of AH@@ I and visual acu@@ ity ) , was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deterioration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year @-@ round phase @-@ 2 study was conducted in which primarily the security and pharmaceuticals of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me was studied at 20 patients , which were at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years of age ( 16 patients with the heavy delay form and 4 with the middle @-@ run form ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased due to heigh@@ tened GA@@ G@@ - mirror in Har@@ n in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg .
in several patients a scale growth ( s = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) determined after the Z @-@ Score for those age group The younger patients with the heavy delay form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and every 4 patients with the middle @-@ run form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with severe delays to be limited only limited or even no progress in cognitive development .
in a phase @-@ 4 study , investigations into pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me @-@ d@@ osing schem@@ ata were performed on the G@@ AG mirror in Har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute test test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 kg / kg intraven@@ ously weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the metering scheme with 200 kg / kg intraven@@ ous every 2 weeks can be in patients who pose difficulties with weekly influenza , however , is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two doses are equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information that will be available every year , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the medicine will be updated .
the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients under the age of 5 was similar to that in older and less affected patients .
based on conventional studies on security tox@@ ic@@ ology , toxicity in mal@@ icious casting , toxicity in repeti@@ tive casting and re@@ producing sto@@ x@@ icity , the pre@@ clinical data cannot detect any particular dangers for humans .

A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( a different medicine against cancer ) if cancer has not been removed ( mal@@ ign@@ ant ) and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( mal@@ ign@@ ant ) - cancer has already spread itself to other parts of the body ) or is likely to spread slightly to other parts of the body ) . • advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ national &quot; lung cancer , which is not the record epith@@ eli@@ um cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta is treated with patients who have not yet been treated before , in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chem@@ o@@ therapies .
to reduce side effects , patients should take during the treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) and inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
when A@@ lim@@ ta is administered along with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , should before or after the gift of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , in addition an &quot; anti@@ em@@ e@@ tics &quot; ( medicine against v@@ om@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent li@@ que@@ fied gel ) .
in patients whose blood @-@ image changes or when certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be decreased above , or the dose should be reduced .
the active form of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed leaves the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells divide .
the transformation of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed in its active form goes easier to equi@@ p in cancer cells than in healthy cells , which leads to higher concentr@@ ations of the active form of the medication and a longer duration of cancer in cancer cells .
for the treatment of mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ oms , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a main study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously given no chemotherapy against their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ specific lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study were compared to 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease , which previously were previously treated with chemotherapy , with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( a different drug against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( a further medicine against cancer ) , and both in combination with c@@ il@@ pl@@ atin in a study at 1 7@@ 25 patients who had never received chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and Cis@@ pl@@ atin , survived on average 12.5 months , compared with 9,@@ 3 months at the sole administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who had previously received chemotherapy was the average survival @-@ time with A@@ lim@@ ta 8.@@ 3 months , compared with 7.@@ 9 months at Doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
in both studies , however , patients in which cancer are not ang@@ ulated the epith@@ eli@@ um cells , during the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta longer survival times than with the comparative medication .
September 2004 , the European Commission presented the company El@@ i Lil@@ ly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. , a permit for in@@ traffic of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union .
every flow rates must be resolved with 4.@@ 2 ml 0.@@ 9 % of so@@ dium chlori@@ de inj@@ ecting solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .

at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dosage examination needs to take place under Ber@@ brid@@ ging - satur@@ ation of the n@@ adi@@ rs of blood or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity of the predictable therapy cycles .
after recovery , patients must be treated in accordance with references in tables 1 , 2 and 3 which are applicable to ALI@@ M@@ TA as Mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ il@@ ine plat@@ inum .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute common Tox@@ icity C@@ rit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degrees 2 ble@@ eding .
should patients non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity may develop ( except neur@@ oto@@ x@@ icity ) , the therapy must be interrupted by ALI@@ M@@ TA until the patient is the value before treatment
the treatment with ALI@@ M@@ TA must be canc@@ eled when patients after 2 dos@@ ages are a hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity or not @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity or not @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity or so@@ - and on the appearance of degrees 3 or 4 neur@@ oto@@ x@@ icity .
clinical studies have no indication that in patients aged 65 Yahweh , or in comparison to patients aged 65 years an increased secondary risk .
ALI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use with children under 18 years of age , due to not sufficient data for the ambig@@ u@@ ity and effectiveness .
in clinical studies in clinical studies were necessary in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min no dosage adjustment necessary , which are recommended for all patients recommended Dos@@ is@@ cent .
the data base in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
however , patients have been studied with a liver functioning of &gt; 1 km of the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - Border value and / or Tran@@ sam@@ osis from &gt; the upper limit value ( in the existence of liver cancer ) or &gt; 5.@@ 0 @-@ kind@@ le of the upper limits ( in the presence of liver cancer ) not specifically studied in the studies .
patients must be monitored with regard to the button of garlic and p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed may not be administered to patients prior to their absolute neutr@@ ro@@ phil@@ en@@ ers once again reaches a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the Th@@ ro@@ symbols again a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dosage reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adir of the absolute Neut@@ ral phil@@ en@@ ers , Th@@ ro@@ symbols and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity , as observed in the previous treatment cycles - ( see Section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxicity and reduction of degrees 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity such as neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ al tox@@ ics such as neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie , f@@ eb@@ b Neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie and infection with degrees 3 / 4 Neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie was be@@ zz@@ ling if a pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
therefore , all patients must be dependent on P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed patients , fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a proph@@ es@@ tic measure for reduction @-@ related toxicity ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium kidney failure ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid the simultaneous ing@@ ster@@ oid Anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and Ac@@ et@@ yl@@ s@@ ali@@ - cy@@ ls@@ acid ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before the therapy , in the day of therapy and min@@ de@@ - T@@ ens 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
all patients , for which a therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed is intended to avoid taking N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ value for at least 5 days before the therapy , in the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
many patients in which these events occurred , they had corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation pressure , pre @-@ existing hyper@@ tension or Diabetes .
therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant liquid supply - accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space a dra@@ inage of the dra@@ inage before the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment are weigh@@ ed .
5 severe cardiovascular events , including M@@ yo@@ k@@ ard@@ in@@ ale events , and cereb@@ ral events were reported in clinical studies with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed occasionally , when this substance is commonly administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance .
for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated substances ( except yellow fever , this vaccination is contra@@ indi@@ an ) not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
as the possibility of a irrever@@ sible impair@@ ment is made possible by p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised before the treatment of treatment - to obtain advice on sperm archiving .
in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) can lead to high doses of ast@@ ero@@ id anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds , such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ic acid ( ≥ 1.3 g daily ) to a decreased p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ex@@ cre@@ tion with the result of a multip@@ ly appearance of side effects .
therefore caution is advisable when patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) are used high doses from N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or Ac@@ e- t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ut@@ acid in high dosage .
I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or Ac@@ et@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ - acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy , in the day of therapy and min@@ de@@ - T@@ ens 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.4 ) .
as no data is possible with respect to the Inter@@ action potential as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or Ro@@ f@@ ec@@ oxi@@ di@@ b , the simultaneous application with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy , the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed .
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the scent status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy calls for increased monitoring frequency of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular Ratio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient - du@@ ck with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for the use of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - ren An@@ tim@@ ber@@ ol@@ ites are expected in an application in pregnancy severe birth def@@ ective .
p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed may not be applied during pregnancy , except when necessarily earnings and after careful consideration of the utility for the mother and the risk for the fo@@ etus ( see section 4.4 ) .
as the possibility of irrever@@ sible damage to the reproductive capacity due to P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be pointed out before the treatment course , advice on the sperm count .

the lik@@ eli@@ hood of occurrence of gast@@ ro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) can increase if alli is taken along with a fat @-@ sufficient individual period or gre@@ edy diet .
as the weight reduction in diabetes can be accompanied with improved met@@ abolic control , patients should take a medicine against diabetes , prior to the beginning of a therapy with alli a doctor or pharmac@@ ist , because the dosage of anti@@ diabe@@ tic needs to be adjusted .
patients who take alli as well as medicines for hyper@@ tension or increased cholesterol levels , should consult their physician or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage needs to be adjusted to this medicine .
it is recommended to meet additional sp@@ aw@@ ful actions , in order to prevent the or@@ als possible in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea possible predi@@ ctions of oral contrac@@ eption ( see Section 4.5 ) .

in clinical studies the most common in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams to observed side @-@ effects ( total 6@@ 33 patients ) , who were at least possibly with alo@@ xi in the context , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitive actions and reactions of appointment ( burning , har@@ dening , complaints and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experiences .
in the group with the highest d@@ osing , similar frequencies showed themselves similar to unwanted events such as in the other d@@ osing groups ; there were no dosage of drugs to observe .
there have been no di@@ aly@@ sis studies , due to the large distribution volume , however , a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably no effective therapy with a alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dose .
in two random@@ ized col@@ blin@@ ded studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients , which received a moderate chemotherapy with &lt; 50 mg / m2 , car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin , &lt; 1,500 mg / m2 Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 kg / m2 ( half @-@ time 4 hours ) or 100 mg Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ time 7,@@ 3 hours ) , which was given every day 1 without D@@ exam@@ eth@@ ason intraven@@ ously .
in a random@@ ised double blin@@ ded study , a total of 667 patients were obtained with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ Cis@@ pl@@ atin , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ cker and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ zin , as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , who were compared to 32 mg On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron , which were given to 1 intraven@@ ously .
results of the studies with moderate chemotherapy and the study with strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables .
in clinical studies on the indication of chemotherapy @-@ in@@ duced nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) were the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ T@@ c inter@@ v@@ alls with the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron comparable .
after the pre@@ dat@@ ory investigations , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the i@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and re@@ pol@@ arization involved in the Ionian channels and extend the duration of the shareholder potential .
the aim of the study conducted at 221 healthy pro@@ ban@@ den was assessing the EC@@ G @-@ effects of i.@@ V. administered by 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
Res@@ or@@ ption After intraven@@ ous gift follows an initial elimination of the Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ations a slow elimination from the body with an average half @-@ term half of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area under the concentr@@ ations time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ) are generally proportional to the entire dosage range of 0.@@ 3 90 μ g / kg for healthy and cancer patients .
after intraven@@ ous gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the average of 11 Ho@@ den@@ os@@ et@@ ron @-@ plasma cutting ( ± SD ) increase in the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron @-@ Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation at 42 ± 34 % .
from the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic sim@@ ulations that the total amount of 0.@@ 25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron reached total tex@@ position ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - the value ) reached by 0.@@ 75 mg of total value ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - the value of 0.@@ 75 mg measured ) with the intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous of 0.@@ 75 mg higher .
about 40 % are eliminated through the kidneys , and about a further 50 % are converted into two primary met@@ abolic density , which have compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron about less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on 5@@ HT@@ 3 recept@@ ors .
in @-@ vit@@ ro studies on the Met@@ abol@@ isation have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in a lesser degree that I@@ so@@ enz@@ me C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
Eli@@ mination After a intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were re@@ found about 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , as un@@ altered active ingredients made about 40 % of the given dose .
after a unique intraven@@ ous bolt of healthy , the total body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
while patients with severe liver function is increased the termin@@ ale Eli@@ min@@ ation reduction and the average systemic exposure with Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , however , a reduction of the dose is however not justified .
in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were observed only after exports , which are regarded as sufficient above the maximum human therapeutic exposure , which indicates a small relevance for clinical use .
10 From the clinical studies there are indications that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block in very high concentr@@ ations of iter@@ acy channels , which can be involved in the v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and re@@ pol@@ arization and extend the shareholder period .
high doses Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose dischar@@ ged in approximately the 30@@ s of the therapeutic exposure to humans ) , led to a growing frequency of liver tum@@ ours , endo@@ cr@@ ine Ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid , pit@@ u@@ itary ) and skin tum@@ ors by rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not completely known , but due to the used high doses and as Alo@@ xi is determined by humans to one unique application , the relevance of these results has been low for humans .

June 2006 , the Committee on Human Healthcare Panel ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative credit , in which the approval of approval for the processing of hep@@ atitis C envisaged by Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml inj@@ ecting solution was recommended .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon a biological medicine named Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A should resem@@ ble an effective component in the EU ( also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference phar@@ ma &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ standing ) hep@@ atitis C ( one caused by an viral infection ) .
in a micro@@ scope examination the liver tissue damage indicates , moreover the values of the liver enzy@@ me Alan@@ in@@ - Amin@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) increases in the blood .
it is produced by a yeast into which a gene ( DNA ) was brought to the formation of the substance .
the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon presented data which occupy the comparison of al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( substance structure , composition and purity of the medication , active , safety and effectiveness at hep@@ atitis C ) .
in the study to patients with hep@@ atitis C , the effectiveness of al@@ ph@@ eon has been compared with the effectiveness of the reference product to 4@@ 55 patients .
the study was measured how many patients after 12 out of 48 treatment weeks as well as 6 months after the treatment of the treatment said ( i.e. no sign of the virus in the blood ) .

furthermore , concerns were raised , that the data for the stability of the substance and of the market @-@ based pharmaceutical drugs have not been sufficient .
the number of patients with hep@@ atitis C , which spoke to treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar in the clinical study .
after the treatment of the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease has res@@ sed more patients than with the reference guide ; moreover , Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects .
apart from that , the test to investigate the question is to what extent the drug is an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) , not sufficiently vali@@ dated .
it may be applied to the treatment of Im@@ peti@@ go ( one with cr@@ ush@@ ed skin infections ) and small in@@ explic@@ ations ( cr@@ acks or sn@@ aps ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wn wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go does not need to be used to treat infections caused by eth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant st@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because al@@ go against this type of infections may not affect this type of infections .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied in patients aged nine months , but in patients under 18 years of age , the skin surface may not be more than 2 % of the surface .
if the patient does not address the patient after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient once more and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial reef ( the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced ) and in@@ hi@@ bits the growth of the bacteria .
the main indicator of the effectiveness in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was cleared after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.@@ 1 % ) of 71 patients under placebo on the treatment .
when treating in@@ doors the Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ efal@@ ex@@ in similar response : when the results of both studies were taken together at Hau@@ tw@@ unden , about 90 % of the patients between the two groups were applied to the treatment .
however , in these two studies , however , that Al@@ tar@@ go was caused during the treatment of waste ( eit@@ ed hol@@ low spaces in the body tissues ) or of infections caused by MR@@ SA , not effective enough .
the most common side @-@ effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a stim@@ ation at the Princip@@ le .
the Committee for Hum@@ ili@@ ary ( CH@@ MP ) to conclude that the advantages of Al@@ tar@@ go during the short @-@ term treatment of the following superf@@ icial skin infections in relation to the risks outw@@ eigh@@ ed : • Im@@ peti@@ go , • infected small in@@ fir@@ ings , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission presented the Gla@@ xo Group Company Ltd. a permit for in@@ traffic of Al@@ tar@@ go across the European Union .
patients in which two or three days no improvement shows , should be examined even once and will be considered an alternative therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
in case of awareness or serious local irrit@@ ation by applying ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be the treatment should be canc@@ eled , the sal@@ be carefully insp@@ ected and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection can be started .
re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not intended to be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known as patho@@ gens or suspected ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical studies at secondary open wounds , the effectiveness of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin was caused by patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) were insufficient .
an alternative therapy is to be considered when after a 2- to 3 @-@ day treatment no bet@@ tering or deterioration of the infected site occurs .
the effect of simultaneous application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other topical means on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous application of other topical medicines is not recommended .
due to the low plasma con@@ cent@@ ric concentr@@ ations , which have been reached by humans for topical skin or infected superf@@ icial wounds , is a clin@@ ically relevant shirt in vi@@ vo not expected ( see section 5.2 ) .
3 After simultaneous gift of 2 times a day 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole increased the average ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max to topical application of 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be on a ch@@ opped skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the small systemic exposure to topical application in patients may not be required if topical re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during a systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a re@@ producing sto@@ x@@ icity after oral intake and are inadequate in regards to a statement on the birth and the fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be applied during pregnancy , when a topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indic@@ ative and the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is the gift of an systemic antibiotic .
when deciding whether the breast@@ feeding is continued / terminated or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go continues / ends , is reduced between the benefit of breast@@ feeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
in clinical studies at 2@@ 150 patients with superf@@ icial skin infections , the Al@@ tar@@ go was applied , the most commonly reported side effect on the occasion of the arrival , which amounts to approximately 1 % of the patients .
active post@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deri@@ vatives of Ple@@ uro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance , which is isolated by fer@@ mentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ anus ) .
the active mechanism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis with interaction at a particular connecting point of the bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ oms , which differs from the ties of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicate that the hy@@ bos@@ om@@ ales Protein L@@ 3 involves and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ connecting location and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ as@@ ez@@ Center .
through li@@ aison at this connecting point Ple@@ uro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer , blocking partly P @-@ binding interactions and prevent normal formation of active 50@@ s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ aler under@@ units .
should be noted on the basis of the local prevalence of resistance to the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in at least some infection forms , a consultation should be pursued through experts .
there were no differences in the In @-@ vit@@ ro activity of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , irrespective of whether the isol@@ ate resistant or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in were .
in the case of non @-@ respon@@ sive to the treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us should be considered the presence of tribes with additional viral factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ ong Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) .
res@@ or@@ ption In a study involving healthy adults was charged 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion to intact and de@@ ported skin for up to 7 days .
from 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , which won 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days to the topical treatment of secondary un@@ infected wounds , individual plasma cutting has been won .
the sampling took place in days 3 or 4 in the adult patients each prior to the medication and in the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual systemic intake involving human subjects after topical application of 1 % Sal@@ be on 200 c@@ m2 ch@@ opped skin ( C@@ max = 22 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 n@@ g · h / ml ) 660 @-@ times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP Hem@@ p .

Ambi@@ rix is used for the protection against hep@@ atitis A and hep@@ atitis B ( diseases that affect the liver ) in children between a and 15 years that are not immune to these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is applied as part of one of two doses existing vaccines , whereby a protection against hep@@ atitis B may only be reached after administration of the second dose .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix is allowed to only be used when the immun@@ isation is a low risk of hep@@ atitis B infection and is ensured that the vaccine can be ended from two doses to an end .
if a re@@ fres@@ her dose against hep@@ atitis A or B is desirable , Ambi@@ rix can be delivered or another hep@@ atitis B or B vaccine .
vaccines effect by bringing the immune system ( the natural defense of the body ) , &quot; as it can against a disease .
after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system det@@ ects the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; foreign &quot; and generates antibodies against it .
Ambi@@ rix contains the same components as which has been approved since 1996 has been approved V@@ rix adults , and has been approved since 1997 for the registered vaccine Twin@@ rix children .
the three vaccines used to protect the same diseases , however , Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix will be administered as part of one of three doses existing vaccines .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix includes adults identical ingredients , some of the data that supports the use of Twin@@ rix adults , also used as a test@@ ament to the use of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children , which had developed a month after the last inj@@ ecting a protective anti@@ body concentration .
in an additional study with 208 children , the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared to a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month gap between the two inj@@ ections .
Ambi@@ rix conducted between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children a month after the last injection for the development of protective antibodies against hep@@ atitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection from Ambi@@ rix had similar to a Se@@ al and 12 @-@ month gap between the inj@@ ections .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed with more than 1 of 10 vaccine ) are head@@ ache , loss of peti@@ tiveness , pain on the inj@@ ecting location , redness , mat@@ ology ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix may not be used in patients , which may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other components or Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) not to be applied .
August 2002 , the European Commission presented the Gla@@ x@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals , a permit for the settlement of Ambi@@ rix throughout the entire region .
the Stand@@ ardis@@ ation plan for the Grun@@ di@@ mm@@ un@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vaccines , whereby the first dose is administered at the date of choice and the second dose to be administered after the first dose .
if a fres@@ hen goes for both hep@@ atitis A and hep@@ atitis B , can be vacc@@ inated with the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ous vaccines or with a combin@@ ant vacc@@ inated .
the anti @-@ hep@@ atitis ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) - and anti @-@ hep@@ atitis ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) - and anti @-@ Hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) -@@ anti@@ body values are in the same size as according to the vaccination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ous vaccines .
it is not yet fully backed up whether immun@@ o @-@ competent persons who have addressed to a hep@@ atitis B vaccine , as they need a re@@ fres@@ her as protection , as it may not be protected by immun@@ ological memory through the immun@@ ological memory .
3 As with all inj@@ ections should be available for the rare case of an an@@ aphy@@ l@@ actic reaction after the gift of the vaccine , corresponding opportunities for medical treatment and monitoring are always available immediately .
if a rapid protection against hep@@ atitis B is required , the standardization scheme with the Com@@ bin@@ ational Wizard is recommended , which contains 360 ELISA units of formal hep@@ atitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis B @-@ surface .
in em@@ modi@@ fying patients and persons with mal@@ functions of the immune system , there will be no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs anti@@ body , so that in these cases the gift of further vaccines can be necessary .
since an intra@@ der@@ mal injection or in@@ tra @-@ mus@@ cular administration could lead to a sub@@ sist@@ ency success , these inj@@ ections should be avoided .
with Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ie or ble@@ eding disorders , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected without exception , since it can occur in these cases after in@@ tra @-@ mus@@ cular gift to ble@@ eding .
if Ambi@@ rix was administered in the second life year in the form of a separate injection , Tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , az@@ ell@@ ular pol@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influenza vaccine ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with a combined mas@@ ern@@ - m@@ umps vaccine , was the immune response to all anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) .
in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects must be assumed that may not be sufficient immune response .
in a clinical study conducted with 3 vacc@@ inations of this formulation was carried out in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , gast@@ ro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , head@@ aches and fever comparable with the frequency , which was observed in the former thi@@ eves and preser@@ vatives .
in clinical studies 20@@ 29 vaccines have been administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ inations at the age of 1 - including 15 years .
in a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 to including 15 years , the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix was compared with that of the 3 @-@ doses combin@@ ant .
only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and mat@@ ness on a calculation base per vaccine Ambi@@ rix , but not on a basis basis per person .
pain was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix at 50@@ ,@@ 7 % of the pro@@ ban@@ den , compared with 3@@ 9,@@ 1 % at the pro@@ ban@@ den after the gift of a dose of 3 @-@ doses of combin@@ ant .
after the complete vaccine @-@ cycle 6@@ 6,@@ 4 % of the ban@@ anas , the ambi@@ rix had received , over pain , compared to 6@@ 3.@@ 8 % at the pro@@ ban@@ den who have been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dosage com@@ bin@@ ations .
however , the frequency of Mat@@ fulness was comparable to a pro@@ band ( i.e. over the entire vaccine cycle at 3@@ 9,@@ 6 % of the ban@@ anas , the ambi@@ rix got , compared with 3@@ 6.@@ 2 % at the pro@@ ban@@ den that received the 3 @-@ doses Com@@ bin@@ ations ) .
the frequency distinctive pain@@ s and ad@@ fast@@ ness was low and comparable that , which was observed after administration of the com@@ bin@@ ational vaccine with the 3 @-@ doses scheme .
in a comparative study at 1@@ - to 11 @-@ year vacc@@ inations , the appearance of local operations and general practitioner in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ group was comparable with that , with the 3 @-@ cans com@@ bin@@ ed hep@@ atitis C @-@ A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ated hep@@ atitis B @-@ surface an@@ tigen was observed .
at the 6@@ - to 11@@ am , however , according to vaccination with Ambi@@ rix , however , was reported a frequent appearance of pain ( at the inj@@ ecting location ) per dose , not per pro@@ band .
the share of vaccines , which reported about heavy side effects during the 2 @-@ cans vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ doses vaccines with the Com@@ bin@@ ational hep@@ atitis B @-@ A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ated hep@@ atitis @-@ B@@ - surface @-@ surface , was not different .

the Ser@@ o@@ converting rates for anti @-@ h@@ bs were 7@@ 4.3 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to the month 6 consecutive dosage ( d. h. in month 7 ) .

the immune response that were obtained in a clinical comparative study at 1@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ old a month after completion of the full vaccine ( i.e. in month 7 ) are listed in the following table .
in both studies the vacc@@ inations were either a 2 @-@ doses scheme with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ doses scheme with a combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis C @-@ A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ated hep@@ atitis B @-@ surface .
in individuals who were at the time of Grun@@ di@@ mm@@ un@@ isation between 12 and 15 years old , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibodies could be proven at least 24 months after the immun@@ isation with ambitions in the 0 @-@ 6 months scheme .
the immun@@ o@@ genic reaction against both anti@@ gens was comparable with that , according to vaccination by 3 doses with a combin@@ ant resin , consisting of 360 ELISA units of formal hep@@ atitis B @-@ surface an@@ tigen in a dosage volume of 0.5 ml has been established .
in a clinical trial at 12@@ - including 15 @-@ year @-@ old , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibodies to be compared 24 months after immun@@ isation in 0 @-@ 6@@ - months vaccine is comparable to that in 0 @-@ 12 months scheme .

the hep@@ atitis A virus is usually transferred by viral food and beverages , but can also be transferred through other ways , like through bathing in through water @-@ waters .
you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a bl@@ aming face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( yellow ) and other symptoms that may possibly be a stationary treatment necessary .
as with all vaccines Ambi@@ rix not completely protect against infection with hep@@ atitis B or hep@@ atitis B virus , even if the full vaccine was completed with 2 cans .
if you / your child before the administration of both vaccines have already been infected with hep@@ atitis B or hep@@ atitis B @-@ virus ( although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or ill / feels ) a vaccination may not prevent disorder .
a protection against other infections that cause the liver or symptoms that are similar to those of a hep@@ atitis B or hep@@ atitis B @-@ B infection can not be convey@@ ed .
• if your child has already been an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine including Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction can express itself through ju@@ ck@@ ling skin ra@@ inf@@ all , respiratory or an@@ gled face or tongue . • If you have occurred with you / your child already an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against hep@@ atitis A or hep@@ atitis B . • if you / your child has a serious infection with fever .
• If you would like to have a protection against hep@@ atitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and prior to the intended use of the second vaccination ) .
in a possible risk of an infection with hep@@ atitis B between the first and second vaccination the doctor will advise you / your child from a vaccination with Ambi@@ rix .
instead he will recommend you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hep@@ atitis B / hep@@ atitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective components per vaccine ( 360 ELISA units of a formal hep@@ atitis B @-@ A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis B @-@ surface ) .
the second vaccination dose of this vaccine with decreased content of effective components is usually administered one month after the first dose and is likely to give you a vaccine before termination of the vaccine .
sometimes Ambi@@ rix will suffer from individuals who suffer from severe blood cl@@ ots suffering from the skin and not in the muscle . • If you / your child are weak@@ ened due to a disorder or treatment in your / her body &apos;s body defense , or if you / your child moves to a her@@ it@@ aly@@ sis .
Ambi@@ rix may be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals on the vaccine cannot be sufficient , so that a blood test can be required to see how strong the reaction to vaccine is .
21 Se@@ eing your doctor if you take your child further medicines ( including those that you can get without prescription ) or if you have been recently vacc@@ inated / or immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) have been administered or has been planned in the near future .
but it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is not protected against one or both hep@@ atitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine must be given simultaneously with Ambi@@ rix at the same time , should be vacc@@ inated at separate places and as possible as possible .
if Ambi@@ rix should be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient .
usually , Ambi@@ rix does not exceed pregnant or breast@@ feeding women unless it is urgent to vacc@@ inated both against hep@@ atitis A and hep@@ atitis B .
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vaccination , talk to your doctor and make an appointment as soon as possible .

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needle and in packs of 50 without needle .
based on the data , which have been known since issuing the first approval for the settlement , represented the CH@@ MP opinion that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive .
since Ambi@@ rix has only been placed in a member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this medicine is limited due to low patient exposure .
Am@@ mon@@ aps can also be used in patients aged over a month with in@@ complete en@@ z@@ ym@@ faul@@ ty or with hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ t@@ mix@@ er ( brain ) in history .
Am@@ mon@@ aps is - divided into several single p@@ ants at meals - swal@@ lowed to be mixed at food or via a gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l ( by the abdom@@ en into the stomach of leading hose ) or a nose @-@ son@@ de ( through the nose in the stomach of leading hose ) .
it was not a comparative study since Am@@ mon@@ e@@ aps could not be compared to any other treatment or with placebo ( a hypo@@ medi@@ al medicine , i.e. without substance ) .
Am@@ mon@@ aps can also result in loss of loss in blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , head@@ ache , fluid , fluid or taste @-@ release , abdom@@ inal pain , v@@ om@@ iting , nau@@ sea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , skin rash , un@@ disturbed body wrap or weight gain .
the Committee for Human@@ itarian Therap@@ y ( CH@@ MP ) to conclude that Am@@ mon@@ aps in patients with disorders of the inary cycle to high am@@ moni@@ ac@@ ces are effectively prevented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps was approved in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because due to the r@@ arity of the illness at the time of admission only limited information about this medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use is indigenous to all patients with which a complete en@@ z@@ ym@@ atic organ has already manifested in the newborn age ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a bel@@ mani@@ fixed form ( in@@ complete en@@ z@@ ym@@ defect , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first life month ) , there is an indication for use when in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese is a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ary .
for inf@@ ants , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with slip @-@ disorders is AM@@ MONA@@ PS also available in gran@@ ular form .
the daily dose is individually calculated considering the intolerance and the development of the daily protein intake of the patient .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg and in Her@@ an@@ growing and adults .
in patients suffering from an early mani@@ feste lack of car@@ b@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ o@@ car@@ car@@ b@@ yl@@ ase , the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ rul@@ lin or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day .
patients with an ar@@ gin@@ ine syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency have to get ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS tablets should not be administered patients with difficulty disorders , as a risk for the emergence of o@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ ul@@ ul@@ cer@@ a , if the tablets are not immediately coming into the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MONA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium , accordingly 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium per 20 g so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS should therefore be used in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe kidney failure as well as with so@@ dium and in@@ dem@@ ise clinical conditions only with caution .
as Met@@ abol@@ isation and ex@@ cre@@ tion of so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ at over the liver and the kidneys occurs , AM@@ MONA@@ PS should be used in patients with liver or kidney failure only with extreme care .
the importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ sting ( see 4.3 ) .
with sub@@ cut@@ aneous types of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young spro@@ uts in high dosage ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , it came to a slow@@ ing of neur@@ onal contrac@@ tion and a stolen loss of neur@@ ons .
it also found a delayed matur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functional neur@@ ons in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be determined if phen@@ yl@@ ic acid is eliminated during men into the mother &apos;s milk , and for that reason , the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS during the l@@ ac@@ tation period ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MONA@@ PS , at 56 % of patients stood at least an unwanted event ( AE ) at 56 % of these und@@ es@@ irable events it was assumed that they were not connected with AM@@ MONA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a probable toxic reaction to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old ab@@ norm@@ ative patient who developed a met@@ abolic encephalopath@@ y in connection with Lak@@ ac@@ acia socket , severe hypo@@ the@@ ology , periph@@ eral neuro@@ pa@@ thy and pancre@@ atitis .
a case of over@@ dose entered at a 5 month old small child with an accidental individual dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate that showed with intraven@@ ous administration of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day a dos@@ is@@ tive neur@@ oto@@ x@@ icity .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed active compound , which is contra@@ sted by acet@@ one with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which is eliminated through the kidneys .
stur@@ chi@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally seen is phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea comparable ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of surplus nitrogen .
5 patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the ur@@ inary cycle can be assumed that for each gram they are bi@@ ased so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ at between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is important that diagnosis is early and the treatment is immediately started to improve the survival chances and the clinical result .
the progn@@ osis of the early @-@ mani@@ feste form of the disease with appearance of the first symptoms in the newborn age was almost always inf@@ au@@ st and the disease led even in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al@@ di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids , or with their pins free analogue within the first life year to death .
through Hä@@ modi@@ aly@@ sis , the utilisation of alternative ways of nitrogen cooling ( Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ at ) , prot@@ ein@@ ben@@ zo@@ ot@@ ate and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of newborn at post@@ part@@ al ( however , within the first age of life ) diagnosed with 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were already treated before the first appearance of a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ary encephalopath@@ y , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients came with the time with many to mental disabilities or other neurological defic@@ its .
in patients with a bel@@ mani@@ um form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ inal form of the or@@ ni@@ otic trans@@ car@@ b@@ yl@@ ase deficiency ) , which were treated by a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ary encephalopath@@ y and then treated permanently with so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ at and a prot@@ ein@@ ated diet , the survival rate was 98 % .
already existing neurological defic@@ its are hardly rever@@ sible in treatment and in some patients may occur a further deterioration of the neurological condition .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at is oxi@@ des to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ ju@@ red in liver and kidney enz@@ ym@@ sch with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentr@@ ations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its met@@ abolic disease in plasma and urine have been determined according to G@@ abe healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary cycle , the h@@ emo@@ glob@@ alized , and with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis after retail and repeti@@ tive gifts of oral cans by up to 20 g / day ( non @-@ controlled studies ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its Met@@ abol@@ ites was also examined in cancer patients according to intraven@@ ous gift of so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ at ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral single dose of 5 g Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ at in tablet form were determined 15 minutes after ing@@ es@@ measurable plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ations by phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary cy@@ c@@ lical dis@@ rup@@ tions or hem@@ ost@@ bin@@ ies , after different doses phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day to 20 g / day ) will be no phen@@ yl@@ ic acid in the plasma .
in three of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , which were repeated with so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ at ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) , the middle phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentr@@ ations in the plas@@ m@@ alls are higher than after the first gifts .
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is eliminated within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ icy product Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine about the kidneys .
after the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test had Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ at with toxic and non toxic doses treated rats ( investigation 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 2@@ 800 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS Gran@@ ules is either taken by oral ( inf@@ ants and children who do not swal@@ low or swal@@ lowing patients with swal@@ lowing ) or through a gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l or a nas@@ al gland .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in newborn , inf@@ ants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg , as well as for growing and adults .
the concentration of ammonia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and Ser@@ um@@ prot@@ esters in the plasma should be kept within the normal range .
in patients suffering from an early mani@@ feste lack of car@@ b@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ o@@ car@@ car@@ b@@ yl@@ ase , the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ rul@@ lin or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5.6 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium per gram Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ at , accordingly 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium per 20 g so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when rats were exposed to the birth Phen@@ yl@@ lo@@ at ( active meta @-@ lit by phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ) , it came to lesi@@ ons in the pyramid cells of the brain rin@@ de .
a probable toxic reaction to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old ab@@ norm@@ ative patient who developed a met@@ abolic encephalopath@@ y in connection with Lak@@ ac@@ acia socket , severe hypo@@ the@@ ology , periph@@ eral neuro@@ pa@@ thy and pancre@@ atitis .
stur@@ chi@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally seen is phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea comparable ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of surplus value
on the basis of studies on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary tract , it may be assumed that for each gram it det@@ ects Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ at between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ ic acid nitrogen .
already existing neurological defic@@ its are hardly rever@@ sible in treatment , and in some patients may occur a further deterioration of the neurological condition .
after an oral single dose of 5 g Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ at in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form 15 minutes after ing@@ es@@ measurable plas@@ ma@@ Con@@ centr@@ ate are determined by phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
during the duration of durability the patient can keep the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not over 25 ° C .
in this action , the small read@@ po@@ on is 0.@@ 95 g , the average measuring po@@ ons 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring po@@ on 8.@@ 6 g so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ at .
if a patient has to receive the drug via a probe , AM@@ MONA@@ PS can be dissolved even in water ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ yr@@ at is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases are missing certain liver enzymes , so they accum@@ ulate the sti@@ ck@@ et@@ ric waste products that accum@@ ulate according to consumption of proteins in the body , not to divor@@ ce .
if you are conducted laboratory tests , you must notify the doctor that you take AM@@ MONA@@ PS because Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ or can affect the results of certain laboratory studies .

An@@ gi@@ ox is applied to the treatment of adult patients with &quot; acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes &quot; ( ACS , reduced blood sugar to the heart ) , e.g. at inst@@ abil@@ er Ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ k@@ ard@@ in@@ far@@ kt ( cardi@@ ac disease ) without an anom@@ al@@ o@@ gram or E@@ KG ) .
will An@@ gi@@ ox applied to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who undergo a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help in patients with Ang@@ ina or cardi@@ ac to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of one PCI .
approximate 14 000 patients took part in the main study on the treatment of ACS at all@@ ot@@ ox or in connection with a gly@@ ph@@ otos@@ ho@@ ist @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ ors ( GP@@ I , a different medicine to prevent blood cl@@ ots ) with conventional combination treatment with yeast infections ) and a GP@@ I was compared .
during the PCI the patient often became a st@@ ent ( a short tubes that remains in the ar@@ tery to prevent a clas@@ p ) and they got additionally some other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and aspir@@ in .
in the treatment of ACS was An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without a gift from GP@@ I - in preventing new events ( deaths , heart attack or Rev@@ ask@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or a year in total as effective as conventional treatment .
in patients suffering from a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was just as effective in terms of all indicators just like he@@ par@@ in , except for heavy blood vessels , where it was significantly more effective than sl@@ par@@ in .
An@@ gi@@ ox must not be used in patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , other shepherd or one of the other components .
it may also not be used in patients who recently had a ble@@ eding , as well as with people with strong hyper@@ tension or severe kidney problems or a heart infection .
the Committee for Human@@ itarian Therap@@ y ( CH@@ MP ) to conclude that An@@ gi@@ ox in the treatment of ACS and during a PCI a decent replacement for s@@ par@@ in is .
September 2004 , the European Commission presented the company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd . a permit for inclusion of angi@@ ox in the entire European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes ( inst@@ ab@@ ile Ang@@ ina / non @-@ lever locks ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) at an emergency stop or if an early intervention is provided .
the recommended initi@@ al@@ dose of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with ACS is a intraven@@ ous bolt of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if a PCI is executed in other words , an additional bolt should be given by 0,5 mg / kg and increases the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery on 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
after the PCI need for clinical requirements , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be added for 4 to 12 hours .
immediately before the procedure , a bol@@ ting of 0.5 mg / kg is administered followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the Rhin@@ op@@ last@@ y .
the recommended dosage of angi@@ o@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous bul@@ b of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and one another immediately subsequent intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and efficacy of a all@@ ot@@ us hub of An@@ gi@@ ox was not examined and is not recommended , even if a short PCI procedure is planned .

in order to reduce the appearance of low ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted medicine should be carefully mixed before the application and the Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis is rapidly administered .
once the ACT amounts to more than 225 seconds , a further monitoring is no longer required , provided the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg In@@ fu@@ sion@@ dose is administered properly .
in patients with moderate kidney kidney ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) that are subjected to PCI ( whether with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in against ACS or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate should be used by 1,4 mg / kg / h .

the treatment with angi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after completion of the intraven@@ ous yeast in or 8 hours after completion of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous casting of low @-@ molecular s@@ par@@ in .
• better known hyper@@ sensitivity to the substance or any other components or against Hir@@ ud@@ ine • active ble@@ eding or increased blood circulation . • severe un@@ controlled hyper@@ tension and sub@@ acute bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of a ble@@ eding , especially when Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see Section 4.5 ) .
even when in PCI patients suffering from Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in most ble@@ eding in arter@@ ial point can occur in patients suffering from a per@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ar@@ ser ( PCI ) , during the treatment in principle everywhere ble@@ eding .
in patients who are taking care in and treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ge , a monitoring of the IN@@ R Wer@@ ts ( International Reg@@ ular Ratio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after inser@@ tion of the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ge should be achieved before the treatment existing level .
starting from the knowledge of the active mechanism of antibodies ( He@@ par@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ ol@@ y@@ tics or thy@@ symbols ) can be assumed that these substances increase the blood danger .
in combination of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in with th@@ ru@@ sting cylin@@ ders or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological here@@ tic parameters are regularly monitored on a regular basis .
the experiments are inadequate in terms of effects on pregnancy , the embryo / fet@@ al development , which is insufficient or the post@@ nat@@ al development ( see under section 5.3 ) .

both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in group as well as in patients with yeast treated as well as patients over 65 years of age , more than 65 years later than in male or younger patients .
serious ble@@ eding were defined according to the AC@@ UI@@ TY and TI@@ MI standards for heavy ble@@ eding like in the foot@@ steps of table 2 .
both light and heavy ble@@ eding occurred at Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in alone significantly less often than in groups with He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ ors and Bi@@ vali@@ printers plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- In@@ inhibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
an AC@@ UI@@ TY heavy ble@@ eding has been defined as one of the following events : in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ular hem@@ at@@ one@@ al , intra@@ oc@@ ular ble@@ eding blood levels of ≥ 3 g / d@@ l with a known ble@@ eding point , re@@ operation due to a ble@@ eding , application of blood products to trans@@ fusion .

the following information on side effects are based on data from a clinical study with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in with 6000 patients who subjected to a PCI .
both in the bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in group as well as in patients with yeast treated as well as patients over 65 years of age , more than 65 years later than in male or younger patients .
both light and heavy ble@@ eding occurred among Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in significantly less often than in the comparative @-@ group under He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
the following side effects which are not listed above were reported after comprehensive application in practice and are arranged according to system organs sorted in table 6 .
in case of over@@ dose the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine is to dis@@ rupt immediately and to monitor the patient with regard to signs of a ble@@ eding .
An@@ gi@@ ox contains Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , a direct and specific Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in@@ inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both at the cataly@@ tic centre and the anim@@ ate region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , irrespective of whether Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in in the liquid phase or at Ger@@ inn@@ sel is bound .
the bond of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in to Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and therefore its effect , is rever@@ sible because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in on the one hand decreases the bond of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Ar@@ g@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , causing the functioning of the active center of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in re@@ generates .
in addition , through Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in with Ser@@ um of patients , where in the past it was come to he@@ par@@ in@@ duced Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ osis / he@@ par@@ in@@ duced Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ osis syndrome ( H@@ IT / HI@@ T@@ TS ) , not induc@@ ing Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ died state @-@ action .

in case of a PCI for the patient , an additional bolt should be given by 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in and increases the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery on 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h .
in the arm A of the AC@@ UI@@ TY study , un@@ question@@ able He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ ine was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ drom ( ACS ) in patients with inst@@ abil@@ er Ang@@ ina / Non @-@ ST @-@ lever ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arms A and B were also random@@ ized to receive a GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either before the beginning of the angi@@ ography ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ isation ) or on PCI .
in the AC@@ UI@@ TY study , the characteristics of high risk factors , which required a angi@@ ography within 72 hours , ev@@ enly distributed over the 3 treatment arms .

ap@@ id@@ ra will be used to treat adults , adolescents and children from six years with diabetes that require treatment with ins@@ ulin .
apse is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdom@@ inal wall , the th@@ igh@@ s or th@@ arm inj@@ ected or administered as a continuous in@@ fusion with an ins@@ ulin pump .
diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough ins@@ ulin to control the glu@@ cose pi@@ le ( sugar ) in the blood or can not process the ins@@ ulin .
ins@@ ulin p@@ ul@@ is@@ in distingu@@ ishes itself very slightly from Human@@ ins@@ ulin , and the change means it is faster and a shorter activity has as a short @-@ effective human@@ ins@@ ulin .
Ap@@ id@@ ra was used in combination with a long @-@ effective ins@@ ulin in patients with type @-@ 1 diabetes , in which the body can not produce ins@@ ulin , in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in type @-@ 2 diabetes , in which the body ins@@ ulin can not be effectively processed , ap@@ id@@ ra was examined in a study with 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was to change the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ ulated h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood , which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
in the first study with adults with type 1 @-@ diabetes , after six months a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % at In@@ sul@@ in@@ l@@ is@@ per .
in adults with type @-@ 2 diabetes the reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with an ap@@ id@@ ra compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human @-@ normal ins@@ ulin .
Ap@@ id@@ ra must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against ins@@ ulin p@@ ul@@ is@@ in or any of the other components , or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
the doses of ap@@ id@@ ra may need to be adjusted when it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood glu@@ cose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission presented the company San@@ o@@ fi @-@ Av@@ entine Deutschland GmbH a permit for the settlement of Ap@@ id@@ ra throughout the European Union .
ant@@ id@@ ra is considered sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of the abdom@@ en , the upper hole or the del@@ usion to apply or sub@@ cut@@ aneous due to continuous in@@ fusion into the area of abdom@@ en .
due to the decreased gluten @-@ hardness capacity and the dimin@@ ished ins@@ ulin delivery , the ins@@ ulin needs to be down in patients with a restriction of the liver function .
any change of substance , the brand ( Her@@ - actors ) , the ins@@ ulin p@@ yp@@ s ( normal , N@@ PH , zin@@ k@@ delayed etc . ) , the type of ins@@ ulin ( animal ins@@ ulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can draw a change of ins@@ ulin demands .
3 A insufficient dosage or dis@@ ruption of treatment , especially in patients with a ins@@ ular diabetes , may lead to a hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and a diabe@@ tic K@@ eto@@ azi@@ ère ; these conditions are potentially life @-@ threatening .
the change@@ over of a patient to another ins@@ ulin type or ins@@ ulin of another manufacturer should be carried out under strict medical supervision and may make a change of the dosage needed .
the timing of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the efficacy profile of the used ins@@ ulin and can therefore change in the conversion of the treatment .
among the substances which can increase the blood sugar @-@ bearing activity and increase the incl@@ ination to hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic acid ( ACE ) -@@ Hem@@ mer , Dis@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , Flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , pent@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , pro@@ voc@@ alist , ge@@ aliz@@ ations and Sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics .
in addition , under the effect of sympath@@ ol@@ y@@ tics such as frau@@ ds , C@@ lon@@ id@@ ine , Guan@@ eth@@ id@@ ine and reserves the symptoms of the ad@@ ren@@ er@@ gen counter @-@ regulation will be weak@@ ened or absent .
veterinary studies for re@@ producing sto@@ x@@ icity showed no differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and Human@@ ins@@ ulin in relation to pregnancy , the embryo / fet@@ al development , the birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in into the human mother &apos;s milk survi@@ ves , but in general the ins@@ ulin occurs neither into the mother &apos;s milk , nor is it res@@ or@@ ated after oral application .
below are the clinical trials known from clinical studies , group@@ ed according to system organs and sorted by decreasing frequency of their appearance ( very frequent : ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10.000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency on the basis of availability ) .

Li@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy Wir@@ d fails to switch the inj@@ ecting location within the injection range , can occur in the sequence a li@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy to the injection position .
serious hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ics with un@@ consciousness can be treated by means of in@@ tra @-@ mus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ k@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , which is given by a trained person , or treated by intraven@@ ous gift of glu@@ cose by a doctor .
after a gluten development , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the urine thing for the heavy hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and avoid similar episodes .
ins@@ ulin lowers the blood sugar levels by the stimulation of the periph@@ eral glu@@ cose intake ( especially by skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) as well as the in@@ hibition of the glu@@ cose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous ga@@ it is done faster and the active time is shorter than with hu@@ - man@@ em normal ins@@ ulin .
in a study with 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type @-@ 1 diabetes mel@@ li@@ - T@@ US showed ins@@ ulin p@@ ulation range from 0.@@ 0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg , a dis@@ proportionate increase in anger effect , just like Human@@ ins@@ ulin .
In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has a double as fast effect as normal Hum@@ ins@@ ulin and achieves the full swing effect about 2 hours earlier than Hum@@ ins@@ ulin .
from the data was obvious that in an application of ins@@ ulin p@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before meal , a comparable post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ cal control reaches like with human@@ ic normal ins@@ ulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
became ins@@ ulin p@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before meal - it became a better post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ al control than with human@@ ic normal ins@@ ulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal .
will ins@@ ulin in@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 15 minutes after the meal - will be a comparable gly@@ cem@@ ic control such as human @-@ normal ins@@ ulin , which is given 2 Mi@@ - n@@ uns in front of the meal ( see picture 1 ) .
ins@@ ulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in G@@ abe 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - previously ) before the beginning of the meal in comparison to human@@ ic normal ins@@ ulin , which was given 30 minutes ( picture 1@@ A ) as well as compared to human@@ ic normal ins@@ ulin , which was given 2 minutes ( normal - previously ) before a meal ( figure 1@@ B ) .
ins@@ ulin p@@ ul@@ is@@ in at G@@ abe 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - retro@@ fit ) after the beginning of the meal compared to human@@ ly Nor@@ - mal@@ ins@@ ulin , the 2 minutes ( normal - previously ) before the beginning of the meal ( figure 1@@ C ) was given .
