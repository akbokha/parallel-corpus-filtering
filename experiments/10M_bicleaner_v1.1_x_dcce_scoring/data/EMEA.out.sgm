<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Appeal report (EPAR), which explains how the studies performed for human therapeutic products (CHMP) has made studies in order to get recommendations regarding the use of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need further information about your disease or its treatment, please read the package price (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">For more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg melting tabletins (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution for insertion (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. wirres thinking and speech, hallucinations (hearing or sight of things that are not present), distrust and madness; • Bier-I-disorder, a psychological disorder in which the patients manic episodes (periods of abnormal mite) alternately with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify will be applied to the treatment of severe up to severe manic episodes and the prevention of manic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injecting solution is used for rapid control of gestated anxiety or behavioral disorders, if the oral intake of the medication is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both diseases the solution can be used or the melting tabletes can be used in patients with the swallowing of tablets difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who are taking different medicines at the same time, the same as Abilify, the dose of Abilify should be adapted.</seg>
<seg id="10">This affects the signal transmission between brain cells by "neurotransmitter," i.e. chemical substances that enable communication of nerve cells to each other.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripizylbenzene probably works mainly as a "partial Agonist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitters Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripipelie like 5-hydroxytryptamine and dopamine, but in a lesser degree as the neurotransmitters has to enable the receptors to activate.</seg>
<seg id="13">Because Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine plays a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripianist contributes to normalize the activity of the brain, causing psychotic or manic symptoms and their reoccur is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of Abilify, the reoccur of symptoms, was examined in three trials over up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injecting solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases caused by a reduced unrest over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify about twelve weeks at 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the effectiveness of Abilify and placebo that reoccur in 160 patients, in which the manic symptoms were already stabilized with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The effectiveness of Abilify injecting solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder, which suffered from gested unrest, compared to Lorazepam (another antipsychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the change in symptoms of patients were investigated using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who speak on the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also carried out studies in order to investigate how the body absorbing the melting tabletins and the solution to decrease.</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies with the injecting solution showed patients who were Abilify in doses of 5,25 mg, 9,75 mg or 15 mg, a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms of increased anxiety than the patients, which received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the application for the treatment of bipolar disorder decreased Abilify in four of the five short-term studies manic symptoms more effective than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also prevented more effective up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo the reoccur manic episodes in previously treated patients and when it was additionally administered to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses reduced also more effective than placebo the symptoms of impaired anxiety and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify for insertion (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyrmitigal interference (uncontrolled freezing), nuisence (solstipation), fatigue, nausea (nausea), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnever (sleeve) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Humanitarian Therapy (CHMP) to conclude that the advantages of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and from moderate to severe manic episode in the treatment of schizophrenia and in which the manic episodes spoke on the treatment with Aripibenzole, to outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the committee came to the result that the advantages of injecting solution during fast control of gestational unrest and behavioral disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with mania-I-disorder when a oral therapy is not suitable to outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission presented the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a permit for inclusion of Abilify throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is for the treatment of moderate to heavy manic episodes of the biz-I- disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and their manic episodes on the treatment with Aripipelvic languages (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once every day regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Increased effectiveness at dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dosage for ABILIFY is 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bee-disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">With regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initialdose should be considered when clinical factors justify this (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4-inductor is set out of the combination therapy, the Aripipelvic dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The appearance of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders, and in some cases reported after the beginning or after the change of an anti-psychotic therapy, also in treatment with Aripianist (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of a epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder, there was no increase of suicide risks with Aripipelines compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripizylbenzene should be applied with caution in patients with well-known cardiovascular diseases (Myokardincolorectal diseases, conditions, which are predispensed for hypotony (dehydration drugs) or hypertension (including akzelerious and maligne form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Spätdyskinesien: in clinical trials, which gave a year or less digest, there were occasional reports on during the treatment with Aripizylbenzene in Dyde.</seg>
<seg id="39">If in case of one with ABILIFY treated patients signs and symptoms of a Spätdyiniesis, should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">When a patient develops signs and symptoms which pointed to a mns, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotics, including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore, Aripipraises should be used in patients with scratching cases in the anamnese or in states that are associated with scratches.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripipraylons in patients with psychosis which are associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripizylbenzene, a heightened steroid compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there was in one of these studies, a study with Fixer dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and the bond for undesirable cerebral events with Aripibenzole patients.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycaemia, in some cases extremely and associated with Ketoaziebox or hyperosmelarem Koma or death, was reported in patients who were treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessment of hyperglycaemia-related unwanted events with ABILIFY and other atypical antipsychotic medication-treated patients, which allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polycarbonate, polyphony, polyphagie and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly in terms of worsening of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">A weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and patients with bipolar identities, the application of antipsychotics in which weight gain is observed as a side-effect, or an unhealthy lifestyle is observed and could lead to severe complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripizylbenzene in the central-consciousness system, caution is advisable when Aripizylbenzene in combination with alcohol or other central efficient medicines with themselves oversized side effects as sedation is taken (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2-antagonist Famotidin, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resortion rate of Aripihip, but this effect is however not relevant as clinically.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy probands increased a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitors (Chinidin) the AUC by Aripipraylons by 107% while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, like fluoxetine and paroxetine, similar effects have and therefore should be made similar dosages.</seg>
<seg id="52">At CYP2D6 'bad' (= "poor") Metabolisier, the common application can result in high-effective inhibitors from CYP3A4 in higher plasma-concentrations of Aripivylons compared to CYP2D6 extensible Metabolisians.</seg>
<seg id="53">If you consider the common gift of Ketoconazole or other high-effective CYP3A4 inhibitors to ABILIFY, the potential benefits should predominate the potential risks to the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other high-effective inhibitors from CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV prototyping inhibitors, should have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dosages reductions.</seg>
<seg id="55">After setting the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitors the dosage should be raised by ABILIFY on the dosages prior to the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 will be administered together with ABILIFY, can be calculated with a moderate increase in the Aripike concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical studies showed cans of 10-30 mg Aripiprylons per day no significant effect on the metabolic ism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (Dextromethine on / 3 Methods (Dextromethine), 2C19 (Omepraylons) and 3A4 (Dextromethine).</seg>
<seg id="58">The patient should be advised to notify your doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during the treatment with Aripianist.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to the insufficient data base for the safety of humans and due to the concerns relating to humans, this medicine may not be applied in pregnancy, unless the potential benefits justifies the potential risk for the foetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other antipsychotics the patients should be warned of dangerous machines, including multi-vehicles, until they are sure that Aripipelie has no negative influence on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects occurred more often (≥ 1 / 100) than on placebo or have been classified as possible medical-related side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of the side-side effects is defined according to the following criteria: frequent (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study over 52 weeks joined in patients who were treated with Aripizylbenzene, a total of lower incidence (25,8%) of EPS including parcisie, acolony and dyskiniesis, compared to patients who were treated with Haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study about 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19% amounted to patients under Aripile-treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 14.8% amounted to patients who were treated with Aripizylbenzene, and 15,1% in patients under Olanzapin therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes in Bibons-I-disorder - In a controlled study about 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 23,5% amounting to patients under Aripiprel- treatment and 53.3% in patients suffering from Haloperidol-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% amounted to patients under Aripiprbenzene treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-time period of over 26 weeks at a placebo-controlled trial the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients under Aripiprero- treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo-treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripipelvic and placebo where potentially clinically significant changes in routinemed controlled laboratory switches appeared, yielded no medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Enhancements of CPK (Kreatin-phosphate kinase), generally temporarily and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of patients with Aripisezole patients, compared to 2,0% of patients treated with placebo-treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="71">At the side-side effects that may occur in connection with an anti-psychotic therapy, and above their appearance also in treatment with Aripizylbenzene, the malignne neuroleptic syndrome, spätebuculary events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical studies and since the market launch, unintentional or intentional overdose with Aripipelvic were observed alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death succession.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there is no information on the effectiveness of a heredialysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripianist; however, it is unlikely that hailalysis in the treatment of an overdose of benefits is, since Aripipelie has a high level of plasma.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the effectiveness of Aripizylbenzene in schizophrenia and Bier-I-disorder on the combination of a participative effect on Dopamine D2- and Serotonin 5HT1- receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors conveys.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripianist showed in vitro a high affinity to Dopamine D2- and D3 receptors and for serotonin 5HT1- and 5HT2a receptor and 5HT7-, to the alpha-1-adrenergen and for Histamin-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">In the gift of Aripizylbenzene in doses from 0,5 up to 30 mg once daily over 2 weeks of healthy probanden showed the Positch-Emissions tomography a dosages dependent bond of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor Liganden, at the Nucleus caudatus and the Putamen.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-time studies (4 to 6 weeks) to 1.228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed Aripipelylbenzene in comparison to placebo a statistically significant increase of psychotic symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a Haloperidol-controlled trial, 52% of the share of Responder patients, who reported a response to the study media, in both groups similar (Aripipelvic 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from measuring scales, which were defined as secondary studio, including PANSS and the Montgomery Asberg- depressants scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than with Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study about 26 weeks in stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia showed a significantly higher reduction of the return rate that was at 34% in the Aripipelvic Group and 57% under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olanzapin-controlled, multinational double blind study in schizophrenia about 26 weeks, the 314 patients occurred and significantly less patients reached a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the output (i.e. an increase of at least 5 kg at an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage about 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the Bier-I-disorder showed Aripielves a opposite placebo over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study about 3 weeks with Fixer dosage with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the Bier-I-disorder showed Aripizylons against placebo no superior efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and active controlled monotherapy studies about 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bee-I-disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, Aripielves showed an compared to placebo over placebo effectiveness in week 3 and a clue effect, comparable to that of lithium or neckidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">Aripipelvic also pointed out a comparable portion of patients with symptomatic remission of the Manie on such as lithium or semi-opidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study about 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bee-I-disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, which partly over 2 weeks do not apply on Lithium- or Valproat Monotherapy at therapeutic Serum- or Valproat monotherapy in therapeutic symptoms, compared to monotherapy with lithium or Valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long-term expansion phase over 74 weeks in manic patients, which had reached a remission to placebo in view of the prevention of a bipolar retreat, predominantly in preventing a bipolar retreat, predominantly in preventing a retreat into the Manie.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on vitro-studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the elongation and hydration of Aripizylbenzene, the N-Dealkyism is catalyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The average elimination-down-time is approximately 75 hours for Aripipelie at extensible Metabolisians over CYP2D6 and at approximate 146 hours at 'bad' (= "poor") metabolic meterors over CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">At Aripianist there are no differences in the pharmaceuticals between male and female healthy probanden, as demonstrated by a pharmacoinetic investigation of schizophrenic patients no gender-dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A-specific evaluation for Pharmacoinetics yielded no reference to clinically significant differences in ethnic affiliation or the impact of smoking on the pharmaceuticals of Aripizylbenzene.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacoinetic properties of Aripizylbenzene and Dehydro-Aripianist were similar in patients with severe kidney failure in comparison to young healthy probanden.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study on probanden with different engulum liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of the liver function of Aripipraylbenzene and Dehydro-Aripiping, but the study comprised only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of class C, which does not suffice to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies on security toxicology, toxicity in repetitive casting, reproducing stoxicity, Genotoxicity and to the canogenic potential, the preclinical data left no particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxikologically significant effects were observed only in doses or expositions, which exceed the maximum dosage or exposure to humans, so they have limited or no importance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects changed a dosages dependent side-dependence (Lipofuscin pigment-accumulation and / or parenchymal cell exposure (AUC) at the recommended maxaldosis (AUC) at the recommended Maximaldosis (AUC) and an increase in secondary school rinal-carcinoma and carcinoma (AUC) at 60 mg / kg / day (the 10fold of the Middle Steady state-exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose of people).</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, a cholelithiasis was established as a result of the suscepting of sulphylbenzene in the Galle von Monkeys according to repetitive oral exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16- to 81times the recommended maximum dose of people based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, the concentration of the highest recommended day dose of 30 mg found concentrations of the sulphate Conjugate of hydroxy- Aripizylons, no more than 6% of concentrations found in the study over 39 weeks in the Galle von monkeys, and lie far under the limits (6%) of vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits these effects were observed after dosages, which led to expositions of the 3 and 11x of the middle Steady state AUC at the recommended clinical maximaldosis.</seg>

<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an antimikrotubules active ingredient which promotes the breakdown of microtubules from the Tubular Indians and stabilizes the microtubules by inhibiting their landolymerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilisation leads to a inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the mikrotubulary network that is essential for the vital interphase and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that Albuminto the Transcytosis from plasma components was conveyed in the endothelcells and in the frame of in-vitro studies have been proven that the presence of Albumin the transport of paclitaxel promotes plant cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is believed that this improved transendothelial transport is conveyed by the gp-60-Albumineceptor and due to the albuminous Proteins SPARC (secreted protein Rich in cysteine) occurs one paclitaxel accumulation within the field of tumors.</seg>

<seg id="749">Abstract of the ECPAR for the public this document is a summary of the European Public Appeal report (EPAR), which explains how the studies performed for human therapeutic products (CHMP) has made studies in order to get recommendations regarding the use of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is applied to treat type-2 diabetes (also known as non-dependent diabetes). • It can be applied alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially overweight patients) where Metformin (a diabolic drug) is not shown. • It can be applied together with another diabetesmediator (dutherapy).</seg>
<seg id="751">It can be applied in addition to metformin in patients (especially overweight patients) which cannot be satisfactory with metformin alone in the highest tolerated dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulfonylharnum or insulin, the previous dose of the sulfonylharnines or the insulin can be retained with hypoglycaemia (lower blood sugar); here the dose of the sulfonylharnines or the insulin should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's physical insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases, which enables type-2-diabetes to be set better.</seg>
<seg id="754">With more than 1 400 patients the effectiveness of Actos in tripletion were examined; the patients received a combination of metformin with a sulphylharnum, in addition they received up to 3.5 years either Actos or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosyliulated hemoglobin, HbA1c) measured, which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos resulted in lowering the HbA1c value, which can close the blood sugar levels in the application of the doses of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the tripletion study the effect of the additional gift of Actos to existing treatment with metformin and an sulfonylharnants in a reduction in HbA1c values by 0.94%, whereas the additional gift of placebo for a reduction of 0.35% led.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study, in which the combination of Actos and insulin was examined in 289 patients, the patients, the Actos in addition to insulin took, a reduction in HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months, compared with 0.14% in the patients who took additionally placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common side effects associated with Actos were visual dysfunctions, infections of the upper airways (colds), weight gain and hypoaesthesia (reduced sensitivity to irritating).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos may not be used in patients which may possibly be hypersensitive (allergic) compared to Pioglitazon or one of the other components, still in patients with liver problems, heart insufficiency or diabetic sound levels (high ketone levels - sawing tiles - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that Actos should serve as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin patients when Metformin is not displayed.</seg>
<seg id="762">October 2000, the European Commission shared the Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited approving a permit for the settlement of Actos in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">The tablets are white until white, round, vaulted and carry on one side the marking "15" and on the other hand the wording of ACTOS. "</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazon is also shown for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is insufficient with insulin and with which metformin due to contraindications or incompatibility is unsuitable (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">For the application of Pioglitazon in patients under 18 years of age are not available any data, therefore the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients suffering from the presence of at least one risk factor (e.g. former heart disease or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the doctor should start treatment with the lowest possible dose and increase the dose.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of a heart attack, weight gain or oils, especially those with reduced cardiovascular reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of cardiac insufficiency, to gain weight growth and oils, when Pioglitazon is applied in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular outcome study with Pioglitazon in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and existing advanced macrovasculary disorder has been carried out.</seg>
<seg id="770">This study showed an increase in reports of heart insufficiency, which however did not lead to an increase in Mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output levels (ALT &gt; 2,5 x upper limit of the normal division) or with other signs of liver disease may not be used Pioglitazon.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT mirror can be increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the board, the liver ymers are to control once again as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient symptoms are developed to refer to a hepatic erectile dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, torso, appetite, appetite, appetite, and / or darker, are the liver polymers to check.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether treatment of patients with pioglitazon continues to be continued until the prelies of the laboratory parameters of clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical studies with Pioglitazone, a dosages-dependent weight gain has been proven that can be brewing of fat deposits, and in some cases it is connected with a liquid state.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of a hermodifying under the therapy with pioglitazon a slightly reduced reduction of the medium hemostbined (relative reduction by 4%) and the hematokrits (relative reduction by 4.4%).</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes have been observed at comparable controlled studies with pioglitazon in patients under Metformin (relative reduction of the hemoglobin um 3-4%) and a lower extent also in patients under sulfonylharnosis and Insulin (relative reduction of the hemoglobins by 1-2% and the hematokrits by 1-3%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of the increased insulin-sensitive surgery, in patients, the pioglitazon is considered orale two or triple combination therapy with insulin libination therapy with insulin, the risk of dosages-dependent hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the launch was reported among the treatment with Thiazolidindions, including Pioglitazon, about a occurrence or degradation of a diabetic Makulaödems with a reduction of visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pioglitazon and the appearance of maculaödems, if patients report on disorders of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmologic declaration should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of reports unwanted events related to bone brood, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazon</seg>
<seg id="782">The fracture incidence amounted 1,9 questionnaires per 100 patients years with the pioglitazon treated with pioglitazon treatment of women and 1,1 fractures per 100 patient-years with women who were treated with a comparatively medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the proactive study, a study conducted over 3.5 years to study cardiovascular events, questionnaires occurred at 44 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5% inctures per 100 patient-years) with patients treated with a comparatively medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">The patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy and if a patient wants a pregnancy or this occurs, the treatment is failing (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies on investigating the interactions have shown that pioglitazon does not have relevant effects on the pharmaceuticals or pharmaceutical dynamics of Digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with medicines that are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. orale contraceptive pills, cyclosporin, calcium-channel blocker and HMGCoA-reduction are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous application of pioglitazon with Gemfibrozil (a Cytochrom P450 2C8- inhibitor) resulting in an increase in the AUC by Pioglitazon around the 3-fold.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazon with Rifampicin (a Cytochrom P450 2C8 induction) resulting in lowering the AUC by Pioglitazon by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to this due to the treatment with pioglitazon which decreases in the pregnancy hyperinsulinaemia and increased insulin resistance of the maternity and thus reduces the availability of metabolic substrates for reddish growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very frequently &gt; 1 / 10; frequently &gt; 1 / 100; occasionally &gt; 1 / 10; rare &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, individual cases: unknown (not estimated that data is not able).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary variation of the turbine and the Breeding indexes of the lens, as they are also observed in other hypoglycemic agents.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical studies with pioglitazon they appeared in clinical studies on the triple of the upper limit of the normal division frequently on how to placebo but less common than in comparisons under Metformin or Sulfonylharnstoff.</seg>
<seg id="793">In a outcome study in patients with existing advanced macrovasculary disorder, the frequency of severe cardiac insufficiency was by 1.6% higher than on placebo if pioglitazon bzw.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the launch has rarely been reported via heart insufficiency in Pioglitazon, more frequently when Pioglitazon was applied in combination with insulin or in patients with cardiac insufficiency in the anamnese.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summary analysis of reports unwanted events related to bone brood, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazon groups and over 7,400 patients in the groups treated with comparisons-treated groups.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the more than a period of 3.5 years of ongoing proactive study, questionnaires occurred at 44 / 870 (5.6%) of the patients treated with Pioglitazon, compared to 23 / 905 (2,5%) in patients treated with a comparatively medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days occurred no symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazon seems to work on a activation of specific nuclear receptors (peroxisome proliferator Activated Receptor-g (PPAR-g)), resulting in the animal-model to an increased insulin in liver, fat and skeleton muscle cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazon reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucosity in case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with pioglitazon versus Gliclazide as Monotherapy was continued over two years to investigate the time up to the posturing of the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 treatment months).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the beginning of therapy a blood sugar control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) by Pioglitazon at 69% of the treated patients (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclazide) are maintained.</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebox study over 12 months, patients whose blood sugar were inadequate despite dreimonatical optimization phase with insulin, to pioglitazon or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazon reduced the average HbA1c - value by 0.45%, compared to the patient who continued only insulin; a reduction of insulin in the group treated with pioglitazon treated group was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical studies about one year, under Pioglitazon has shown a statistically significant decrease in the Albumin / Kreatinin-Quotient in comparison to the output values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of pioglitazon (Monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small, on 18 weeks investigation of type-2 diabetics.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials compared to placebo a reduction of the overall plasma triglyceride and the free fatty acids and an increase of HDL- cholesterol levels as well as a minor but clinically not significantly increased L- cholesterol levels observed.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical studies about a period of up to two years reduced pioglitazon compared to placebo, metformin or gliclazide the total plastic glyceride and the free fatty acids and increased the HDL cholesterol levels.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo under Pioglitazon, there was no statistically significant increase in the LDL cholesterol levels, while under Metformin and Gliclazide reduced values have been observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study about 20 weeks reduced pioglitazon not only the sober triglyceride, but also improved the postprandial increased triglycerides levels, this is both an effect on the triglyceride absorption and the hepatic triglycerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the proactive study, a cardiovascular outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovasculary disorder in groups randomized, which received over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular therapy either pioglitazon or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application Pioglitazon is quickly resorated, whereby the top concentrations of unchanging pioglitazon can be reached in plasma 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV for the effectiveness in about the triple of the effectiveness of Pioglitazon, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In Interaction studies could be proven that Pioglitazon has no relevant effect on the pharmaceuticals or pharmaceutical dynamics of Digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous application of pioglitazon with Gemfibrozil (a Cytochrom P450 2C8- inhibitor) or with Rifampicin (a Cytochrom P450 2C8-inductor) or lowers the Plasmakonzentration of Pioglitazon (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">According to oral application of radioactive markings pioglitazon in humans the marker was found mainly in the thread (55%) and a lower extent in the harn (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The mean plasma-elimination period of unchanging pioglitazon amounts to people 5-6 hours, and all of the active metabolic rate lies at 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The Plasmakonzentrations from Pioglitazon and its Metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function lower than with healthy probes, whereby the rates of the oral clearing of the maternity are resemble.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxiologic studies occurred in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys in agreement after repetitive administration of plasma volume, anaemia and reversible eccentric heart hypertrophia.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to this due to the treatment with pioglitazon which diminished in the shape of hyperinsulinaemia and increased insulin resistance of the maternity and reduces the availability of metabolic substrates for reddish growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) were inducted by the rat (in male and female rats) and tumors (in male rats) of the urinary epithelium epithelium.</seg>

<seg id="823">The fracture incidence amounted 1,9 questionnaires per 100 patients years with the pioglitazon treated with pioglitazon treatment of women and 1,1 fractures per 100 patient-years with women who were treated with a comparatively medication.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the proactive study, a study conducted over 3.5 years to study cardiovascular events, questionnaires occurred at 44 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5% inctures per 100 patient-years) with patients treated with a comparatively medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In a further study over two years the effects of a combination therapy of metals were examined with pioglitazon or gliclazide.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical studies about 1 year, under Pioglitazon has shown a statistically significant decrease in the Albumin / Kreatinin-Quotient in comparison to the output values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study about 20 weeks reduced pioglitazon not only the sober triglyceride, but also improved the postprandial increased triglycerides levels, this has an effect on the tracyglyceride absorption as well as the hepatic Trygimmerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study was lacked with regard to their primary end-point, which a combination of the total amount, non-deadly myocaress, pooncularization and Revaskcularization of the leg arteries, place the results close that with the intake of pioglitazon are not associated with the intake of pioglitazon long-term risks.</seg>

<seg id="1403">Furthermore, the results of a clinical study were presented to 668 patients with Nierentrants, whereby the application of Advagraf with Prograf / Prograft or Ciclosporin was compared.</seg>
<seg id="1404">The main indicator of the effectiveness was the number of patients with which the transplant was crashed after a treatment duration of one year (by example, for example, how often a renewed organ transplantation or a resumption of the dialysis was required).</seg>
<seg id="1405">In addition, more recent studies on 119 patients with low transplantation and 129 patients were carried out with liver transplant and examined how Advagraf is recorded in comparison to Prograf / Prograft from the body.</seg>

<seg id="1410">Only doctors who are familiar with the immunosuppressive therapy and the treatment of transplant patients should assign this medicine or make changes in immunosuppressive therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences of the systemic exposure of Tacvilimus this can lead to transplits or to an increased incidence of side effects, including under- or overimmunoimmune systems.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always keep the same Taconlimus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage; change of formulation or the regime should be conducted only under the tightening control of one in the transplant-experienced physician (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">As a result of a conversion to an alternative formulation, a therapeutic medication must be carried out and corresponding dosage adjustments to ensure that the systemic exposure of Tacvilimus will remain.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dosage of Advagraf should be primarily based on the clinical assessment of disstocking and compatibility in individual case and on blood levels.</seg>

<seg id="1417">Careful and repeatable controls of the Tacrulimus valley mirror are recommended during the first two weeks after transplant under Advagraf to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate aftermath phase.</seg>
<seg id="1418">Since Tacrolimus is a substance with low clearing, an adjustment of the Advagraf-Dosisescheme can take several days until the steady State reaches.</seg>

<seg id="1421">Dosage recommendations - Nierentrantation prophylaxis of the transplantation The orale Advagraf therapy should start with 0,20 - 0.30 mg / kg / day as a day daily gift in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1422">Further dosisadjustments can be later required since the Pharoinetics of Tacrolimus can change in the course of stabilization of patients after transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Dosisrecommendations - liver transplant prophylaxis the orale Advagraf therapy should start with 0,10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as a day daily gift in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Dosage route - conversion from Prograf on Advagraf must be a transplant receiver of twice daily dosage of prograf capsules on a once daily intake of Advagraf's times, this changeover in relation 1: 1 (mg: mg), related to the entire daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1425">Kidney and liver transplant After an conversion from other immunosuppresants to Advagraf once daily, the treatment with the respectively in Nieren- and liver transplant initialdosis must begin with the prophylaxis of the transplantation.</seg>

<seg id="1428">Dosage adjustment in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function to maintain blood talents in the desired area can be required in patients with severe liver functioning of the dose.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced kidney function Da the kidney function has no influence on the pharmaceuticals of Tacvilimus, can be assumed that a dosage adjustment is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1430">Due to the nephrotoxical potentials of Tacrolimus, however, a meticing monitoring of kidney function (including a regular determination of the Serumcreatininspects, a calculation of creatininers and a monitoring of the urinary volume).</seg>
<seg id="1431">Changeover from Ciclosporin on Advagraf in the changeover from a Ciclosporin- to a tacrolimus-based therapy is advisable (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">Recommendations on the valley mirror in full-bloodiest The dose should be primarily based on the clinical assessment of disstocking and tolerability in the individual case under the aid of full-bloodiest-Talsi controls.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to carry out frequent checks of the tacrolimus valley levels during the first two weeks after transplant, followed by periodic checks during the maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood circulation of Tacvilimus should also change after the conversion of Prograf on Advagraf, dosage adjustment, changes of immunosuppressive therapy or even more simultaneous application of substances which could change the Tacrulimus wholeccentric concentrations (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since Advagraf is a medicine with a low clearing, adjustments of the dose may need several days until the steady state has entered.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical studies make it possible that a successful treatment is possible in most cases if the slows not exceed the blood 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the slows of tacrolimus lie in full swing in the first time after liver transplations usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and for renal patients with 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the following narration treatment of liver, Nieren- and cardiac-transplants were usually used blood concentrations in the range of 5 to 15 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to severe undesirable events, including transplanting or other side effects which can occur in a sequence of tacrolimus underor or exposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always keep the same Taconlimus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage; change of formulation or the regime should be conducted only under the tightening control of one in the transplant-experienced physician (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 For the treatment of adult patients with transplantation, which proved to be done against other immunosuppressants as refractory products, there are no clinical data for retarded formulation Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1442">For prophylaxis of the transplantation on adult heart transplants and transplits people in the chin-age are not yet no clinical data for the retarded formulation Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Because of possible interactions, which can lead to a tightening of the tackllimb levels in the blood and a weakening of the clinical effect of tacrolimus, the intake of herbal supplements, the currant (hypericum perforatum), or other plant cures during a treatment with Advagraf (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea is a particularly careful monitoring of the tacrolimus- concentrations in the blood provided that the Tacrulimus blood mirror in such circumstances can be significant fluctuations.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, under Prograf there was a cardiomyopathy attached chamber - or Septumhypertrophia, which can therefore also be found under Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such sounding disorders, are an already existing heart suffering, a treatment with cortical eroids, hypertension, kidney or liver dysfunctions, infections, liquid overload and oils.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuppressva, the impact of sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of maligning skin lesions by suitable clothing or use of a solar protection by means of a high protective factor.</seg>
<seg id="1448">If patients, the Tacvilimus occupy symptoms for pres like headaches, altered state of consciousness, crashes and visual disorders, should be a radiological investigation (e.g.</seg>

<seg id="1450">The simultaneous application of medicines or herbal remedies that are known as Hemmer or induction of CYP3A4, can affect the metabolism of tacrolimus and thus reduce the blood values of tacrolimus or lower their blood values.</seg>
<seg id="1451">It is therefore recommended to change the Tacrulimus- blood mirror at the same gift of substances which can change the CYP3A metabolism and to adjust the tacrolimus dose to maintain uniform concentrations accordingly (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="1454">High-dosidnisolon or methylprednisolon, as is used in acute scanning actions, the concentration of tacrolimus can increase or reduce the concentration of tacrolimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">Effect of tacrolimus on the metabolism of other medicines Tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4-Hemmer; therefore, the simultaneous application of tacrolimus can be metabolized by CYP3A4 metabolic metabolic disease.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Since Tacrolimus descends the clearing of steroid-contraceptive pills and thus increase hormone exposure, is especially careful in decisions about receptive measures especially carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animals have shown that Tacvilimus potentially lessen the Clearance of Pentobarbital and phenazon and to extend their half-value.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a limited number of investigations on transplant patients provide no evidence that under Tacvilimus in comparison with other immunosuppressants have increased risk of unwanted events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since the initial data transfer, the CHMP is continuing to assess the benefits of risk assessment, but considering that the safety profile for the following reasons must be closely monitored:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, the CHMP is on the basis of the security code of ADVATE, which makes a filing of PSURs every 6 months required, decided that the eligibility holder should apply for another five years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">December 2008 Gendux Molecular Limited announces the Committee on Human Development (CHMP) officially that the company will withdraw his request for approval for the processing of Advocin for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Normally, however, the breast, the brain, the bones, or the crossover (tissue, the other structures in the body connects, surrounds and relies) of it.</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a type of virus that's genetically modified so that it can carry out a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">The virus in Advexin is a "Adenovirus," that has changed so that there cannot be copies of themselves and therefore cannot trigger infections in humans.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advocin could have been injected directly into the tumors and thus allow cancer cells to form the normal p53 protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein, which is made of the not broken in the human body existing p53 gene, usually contributes to the restoration of corrupt DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA can not be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1646">At Li-Fraumeni Cancer, in which the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein is not working properly, and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study with a patient before the Li-Fraumeni Cancer in the field of undermining, into the bones and the brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP asked the answers to the questions asked questions, there were still some questions unsolved.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the examination of initial documents submitted the CHMP to tag 120 creates a list of questions that will be sent to the company.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to the CHMP was not sufficiently proven that the injection of Advexin Li-Fraumeni tumors brings benefits to patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee also had concerns about the processing of the medication by means of the body, type of administration, as well as the security of the medication.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company had not sufficiently proven that Advexin can be produced in a reliable manner and that it is neither for the environment or for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The firm has not been aware of the CHMP, whether the return consequences for patients currently participating in clinical studies or "Compassionate Use" programs with Advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "" "" "changing realities" "" "means that the tablets are so assembled that one of the effective components will be released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours." ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used for treating the symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, applied by an allergy to pollen inflammation of the nasal passages) in patients with nasal mucosal swelling (hidden nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and young people aged 12 years, the recommended dose of aerinaze is twice daily, which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and ended as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nose-smucosa (petoped nose).</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medication can be scramusing on the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main measures were the changes of the heavegraids of the hypocrisy ymptomome that were reported by the patients prior to the start of treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study patients received their symptoms every 12 hours into a diary and rated with a standard scale, how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">When considering all grasshoppers of ymptomy except the constipation of the nose reported the patients, the Aerinaze, about an acceptance of symptoms around 46.0%, compared with 35,9% in the patients, the pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nose-smucosa was seen, the patients showed under the aerinaze a alleviation of symptoms around 37.4% compared to 26.7% in patients, the desloratadine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of aerinaze (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachykarmic (cardiac disease), pharyngitis, antorexia (appetite, headache, fatigue, insomnia (sleeability), sleeve disorders and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be used in patients who may be oversensitive (allergic) against desloratadine, pseudoephedrine or one of the other components, against adrenaming agents or loratadine (a different medicine for the treatment of allergies) are not applied.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze may also not be used in patients suffering from a bottlenght (high eye pressure), cardiac disease or vascular disease (hypertension), hyperthyroose (overfunction of the thyroid) or have already caused a hemorhagonian stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission appointed the company SP Europe granted approval for the intraffic of Aerinaze in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, however, is to swallow in the whole (that is, without crashed or chewing).</seg>
<seg id="1668">The aerinaze should not be applied to children under 12 years due to the failure of data for the ambiguity and efficacy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the end of the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the usage time on 10 days because in long-term waste the activity of pseudoephedrine can decrease in time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After decline of the swelling of the mucosas in the upper airways the treatment can be continued with desloratadine as monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since aerinaze Pseudoephedrine contains, the drug is also contrasting in patients who are treated with a monoaminoxidase (MAO) -Hemmer or within 2 weeks after completion of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to alphamimetic activity in combined application of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictine, pergoid, lanergine, cabine or nasal, phenylephrine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, Oxymetazoline, Naphazard etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The security and effectiveness of this combination therapy have not been tested for this patient collective, and the data will not be sufficient for the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and effectiveness of aerinaze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver disrupting and the data will not be sufficient for the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed that treatment in the occurrence of hypertension or a tachykarite or from Palpitations, arrhythmia, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (like headaches or a reinforcement of the headaches) must be set.</seg>
<seg id="1677">In the treatment of following patients groups, patients suffering from digital is • patients with cardiac disease • patients with hypertension • patients with hypertension • patients with a myokardincolor in the anamnese, diabetes mellitus, blienhalosstrual strual strual strual strual struzstrual or bronchigerm in the Anamnese.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze is entitled at least 48 hours prior to performing dermatological testing since antihistaminika otherwise can prevent positive reactions to indicators for doorstep or reduce their scale.</seg>
<seg id="1679">Within the framework of clinical tests with desloratadine, where erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally administered, however, no clinically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma-concentration of desloratadine were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">In the results of the psychomotor testing there were no significant differences between the patients treated with desloratadine and the patients treated with placebo-treated patients regardless of whether desloratadine was taken alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">That for the Metabolism of Desloratadine responsible enzyme has not yet been identified so that interactions with other drugs cannot be excluded completely.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin inhibits in-vivo CYP3A4 not, and in-vitro studies have shown that the medicine CYP2D6 does not inhibit and neither a substrate nor a inhibitor of the P-Glykoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The inconsistency of the use of aerinaze during pregnancy is not guaranteed, experience from a large number of affected pregnancies, however, no increase in frequency of abnormalities compared to the frequency at the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproduction studies at animals are not always transmitted to humans and due to the vasoconstrictory properties of pseudoephedrine should not be applied to aerinaze in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be raised about it that in very rare cases it can come to a benrity that can lead to a impairment of the traffic or the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1686">Symptoms may vary between a ZNS depression (sedation, apnea, diminished mental attention, cyanosis, coma, coronary cardiovascular collagen) and a ZNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations) with possible letins.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headache, anxiety, frightening effect, muscular tissues, euphoria, arousal, respiratory disorders, thirst, curity, nausea, hawells, tinny, tinnie, tendings and hypertension or hypotony.</seg>
<seg id="1688">A ZNS stimulation is particularly probable in children, just like Atrophiin-typical symptoms (mouth-dry, plupillenrigid and - dilatation, bonthering, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include both the inhibition of the release of pro-inflammatory cytokinen such as IL-4, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as the inhibition of the expression of the Adhemsionsmolls P-selection on endothelcells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose study with adults showed Desloratadin 5 mg did not affect standard measuring sizes of the flups, including the strengthening of subjective diligence or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical trials at the recommended dosage of 5 mg per day, no increased frequency of punctuality in comparison to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The orale application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage can produce more personomimetic effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, a tachykaror or manifestations of a ZNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">It took 1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rhinitis, with 414 patients Aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies the histaminantagonistic effectiveness of Aerinaze tablets, determined by the overall effect for the symptom (except nasal-skin-swelling), significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The effectiveness of aerinaze tablets with regard to the fluctuating effect, determined by the nose-slightening effect, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with desloratadin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The effectiveness of aerinaze tablets showed no significant differences in regard to gender, age or ethnic affiliation groups.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of a single dose study for the Pharmacoinetics of Aerinaze is desloratadine within 30 minutes of administration in the plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the perorical application of aerinaze with healthy probanden over 14 days the flow-weight of desloratadine, 3-hydroxydesloratadine and pseudoephedrine in day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">As part of a pharmacoinetic multi-specialist study, which was carried out with the formulation as a tablet to healthy adult probanden, has been realized that four probanden desloratadine is very rare.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component Interaction study shows that the exposure (Cmax and AUC) of pseudoephedrine according to the sole gift of pseudoephedrine in bioequivalent was to exposure to Gabe an Aerinaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on conventional studies on security harmacology, for toxicity in repetitive gift, to Genotoxicity and to reproducing stoxicity, the preclinical data with desloratadine disagree with no particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination possessed no greater toxicity than their individual components, and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient of pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In Reduction stoxiological studies the combination of Loratadin / pseudoephedrine was in the oral ggles in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in rabbits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day not teratogenic.</seg>

<seg id="1893">In June 2008 Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics S.r.l. the Committee for Human Development (CHMP) officially launched its application for approval for Influnov to prevent the aviary H5N1 influenza in adults and elderly people.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect the flu, which is caused by the tribe (type) H5N1 of the influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special kind of vaccine that could cause a trunk of Grippevirus that could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A flu pandemic breaks out when a new tribe of the Grippevirus emerges, which can easily spread from man to person because people do not have immunity (no protection) against it.</seg>
<seg id="1897">After administration of the vaccine, the immune system detects the parts of the grip-virus as a "body-foreign" and forms antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">Thus the immune system is able to form faster antibodies in contact with a grip-virus of this pedims.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the membranes of the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface, which recognizes the human body as physical alien), unmatched and used as a component of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Inspection of some of the study entres showed that the study was not conducted according to the "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">Thus, the scope of the clinical data base for the evaluation of the safety of the vaccine is not made to meet the requirements of the EMEA guidelines for preventive vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="1902">If you are interested in a clinical trial and require further information regarding your treatment please contact your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="1903">For more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="1904">It is applied in combination with other antiviral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years that are caused by human immunoweaker virus from type 1 (HIV-1), which are caused by the acquired immunosyniciency Syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients who cannot swallow the capsules, it is available as a solution to pick up, but these cannot be taken together with Ritonavir because the security of this combination has not been studied.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Agenerase should only be assessed when the doctor has examined, which antiviral medicines has been taken before, and the likelihood has asserted that the virus is addressed to the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily, which will be taken along with twice daily 100 mg Ritonavir and with other antiviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1908">In children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of agenerase is aimed after body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">Agenerase is reduced when combined with other antiviral medicines the HIV crowd in the blood and keeps them at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">AIDS does not cure, however, can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also delay the development of associated infections and diseases.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenerase was examined in combination with other antiviral medicines, however without Ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults who had previously not been treated with protesters.</seg>
<seg id="1912">This reinforced with low dosisted Ritonavir enhanced drug Agenerase was taken at 206 adults, which had previously been protracers earlier, with other protracers.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator of the effectiveness was the proportion of patients with non-breaking concentrations of HIV in the blood (Viruslast) or the change in Viruslast after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies involving patients who previously had no protesters had been taken under Agenerase more patients a Viruslast among 400 copies / ml than on placebo but agenerase was less effective than Indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children reduced Agenerase, the Viruslast, although were treated by the children who were treated earlier with Protect dents, very few of the treatment said.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults who had been treated earlier with Proteased drugs, the Viruslast increase was just as effective as other protracers after 16-week treatment:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In patients with HIV, which was resistent against four other proteasers, it came under Agenerase along with Ritonavir to a stronger waste of the Viruslast after four weeks than with the patient who continues to have their previous protesters:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of angenerase (observed with more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, diarrhoea (diarrhea), flat sea (nausea), vomiting, rash and fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenerase may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) against amaavir or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Agenerase may also not be used in patients suffering from currants (a herbal supplement to treat depression) or drugs that are as well as asterase and are harmful to high concentrations in the blood of health.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines for HIV, the angenerase is taking into account the risk of an Lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of body fat), one osteonekrose (symptoms of bone tissue) or an immunoactivation syndroms (symptoms of an infection which are caused by the recovered immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee for Human Development (CHMP) to conclude that the benefits of ageneric medicines used in combination with other antiretroviral medicines used to treat HIV-1-infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenerase is usually taken along with the pharmacoinetic amplifier, but the Committee established that the use of angenerase in combination with Ritonavir in patients who have previously won't have been proven before.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"" "Agenerase was originally approved under" "" "extraordinary circumstances" "", "as at the time of approval for scientific reasons, limited information is limited." ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">October 2000, the European Commission presented the Glaxo Group company Limited permit permission for Ingenerase in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Angenerase is available in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of HIV-1- infected, prototyping adult and children from 4 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1927">For usually, Agenerase capsules are to be administered for the pharmacoinetic boobs of amplavir along with low doses of Ritonavir (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of amplavir should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance resistance and the pre-treatment of the patient (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of amaavir as a solution to incanding is less than 14% lower than from Amraavir as a capsule; therefore, are angenerase capsules and solution to insertion on a milligrams per milligram basis not interchangeable (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 600 mg Ambitavir twice daily along with 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenerase capsules are applied without the amplifying commitment of Ritonavir (Boobs), higher doses must be applied to agenerase (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg Ambitavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg Amtiavir that should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">The pharmaceuticals, efficacy and safety of angenerase in combination with low doses of Ritonavir or other protesters have not been studied in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Ingenerase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age, due to the missal of data for inconsistency and effectiveness (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on the pharmacoinetic data the dosage should be reduced to Agenerase capsules in adult patients with medium-heavior liver disturb on 450 mg twice daily and in patients with heavy liver function to be reduced to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The simultaneous application is to be done in patients with mild or even liver disturbance with caution, in patients with severe liver function, it is contrasting (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Agenerase may not be given simultaneously with medicines that possess a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the Cytochrom P450-Isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal supplements which contain currants (hypericum perforatum), may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a diminished therapeutic effect of amaavir during the intake of amputavir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be noted that agenerase or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of an HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy including the treatment with angenerase prevents the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Should usually be applied Agenerase capsules along with low doses of Ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral medicines (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and are treated with an antiretroviral combination therapy, have an increased risk for heavy liver effects with potentially deadly disease.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the event of simultaneous viral treatment of hepatitis B or C please read the relevant information of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with pre-existing monitoring function including a chronic-active hepatitis show an increased frequency of liver dysfunctions under an antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous application of Agenerase and Ritonavir with Fluticason or other glucose cores, it is not recommended that the potential benefits of a treatment is associated with the risk of systemic cortical effects including Morbus Cushing and Suppression of the trinical function (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">As the metabolism of the HMG-CoA-reduction Hemastatin and Simvastatin strongly depends on CYP3A4, becomes a simultaneous administration of Agenerase with Lovastatin and Simvastatin because of the increased risk of myopathies including Rhabdomyolysen.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life-threatening side effects, like Carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International Regular Ratio), methods are available for determining the substance concentration.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients who are taking these medicines at the same time, Agenerase can be less effective because of reduced plasmics in amavir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with Amrovir can be the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptive pills, however the information is not sufficient to cherish the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">When methadone is given simultaneously with Amtiavir, patients should therefore be monitored on opiatentment symptoms, especially if also low doses are administered by Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Because of the potential risk of toxicity due to the high propylchycolgeance of the agenerase solution for inclusion, this Darreichungsform is contrasted in children under a age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Disgenerase should be placed on duration 5 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms, or the mucous membranes (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">In patients, which received an antiretroviral therapy including protracers, was reported on the appearance of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycaemia or an extraterrestrial of an existing diabetes mellitus.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other diseases, to their therapy medicines that were necessary with the development of a diabetes mellitus or a hyperglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and with drug addiction factors, such as a longer lasting antiretroviral treatment and the associated metabolic disorders, associated with.</seg>
<seg id="1956">At hammophiles patients (type A and B), which were treated with Protectors, reports of an increase of bleeding including spontaneous kutaner haemome and hemosteoarthritis.</seg>
<seg id="1957">In HIV infected patients with serious immune defective can develop an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections that leads to severe clinical states or deterioration of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although a multi-factorial equtiology is adopted (including the use of cornosteroids, alcohol consumption, heavy immune diseases, higher body mass index), were reported cases of Osteonekrose especially in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long-term application of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with low therapeutical width agenerase may not be given simultaneously with medicines that possess a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the Cytochrom P450-Isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutical width asymph with Ritonavir must not be confused with medicines whose active ingredients are produced mainly via CYP2D6 and are connected to the increased plasmics with hardest and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It was shown that Rifampicin has caused a 82% reduction in the AUC of Amtiavir, which can lead to a virological failure and lead to a resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In the attempt to compensate the lower plastic wrap through a dosage increase of other protector inhibitors in combination with Ritonavir, very frequently unwanted effects on the liver have been observed.</seg>
<seg id="1963">Johanniskwort (hypericum perforatum) The Serum mirror of amplavir can be humiliated by the simultaneous application of herbal preparations with currants (hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient begins already Johanniskwort, the amplavirting mirror and, if possible to review the Viruslast and to enforce the currant.</seg>
<seg id="1965">A dosage adjustment for one of the medicine is not required if clofinavir is administered together with Amtiavir (see also Efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increases, for Cmax on the other hand by 30% if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) in combination with Ambitavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical studies, doses of 600 mg of Amonavir twice were applied twice daily and Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily, which occupy the effectiveness and inconsistency of this treatment regimen.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% humiliates when Amtiavir (750 mg twice daily) in combination with Kaletra (400 mg of Lopinavir + 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of Amtiavir (600 mg twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg of Knights (600 mg twice daily) in combination with 100 mg of konavir twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1970">A dosage intake for simultaneous administration of Amrovir and Caletra can not be given, however, it is recommended a tightly monitoring, because the effectiveness and inconsistency of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">There was no pharmacoinetic study carried out in combination with Didanosine, but is recommended due to the imaginative component of Didanosin, however, that the revenue of didanosine and agenerase is at least an hour apart (see Antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, at the gift of Efavirenz in combination with Amtiavir (600 mg twice daily) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) no dosage adjustment is required.</seg>
<seg id="1973">The treatment with Efavirenz in combination with Amtiavir and Saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both proteasers would be low.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of Nevirapin on other proteasers and existing limited data may suspect that Nevirapin the Serumkonzentration of Ambitavir might be sensed.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these drugs should be used at the same time, caution is advisable because Delavirdin could be less effective because of the decreased and possibly subtherapeutic plasmics could be less effective.</seg>
<seg id="1976">When these medicines are used together, caution is advisable; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be made, as a precise prediction of the effect of the combination of amplavir and Ritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous figment of amplavir and rifabutin led to a rise in plasma concentration (AUC) of Rifabutin by 193% and thus an increase of the side-related side effects associated with rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer Rifabutin together with Agenerase, becomes a reduction in the dosage of Rifabutin at least half of the recommended dose, although no clinical data is available.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmaceutical Studies with Agenerase in combination with erythromycin were not carried out, however, the plasmics of both medicines could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg Fosamprenavir and 100 mg ketoconazole once daily lead to an increase in Cmax of Ketoconazole compared to the value which was observed after 200 mg Ketoconazole once daily without simultaneous application of Fosamprenavir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines that are listed below are also substrates, Hemmer or induction of CYP3A4, if they are applied together with asgenerase, possibly at interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be linked to toxic reactions, which are associated with these medicines, if they are applied in combination with aging.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other proteasers it is advisable that Antazida is not taken at the same time as Agenerase because it can come to resortion disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous application of anticonvulsiva, which are known as enzymes (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepin), with Amroavir can lead to a degradation of the plasmalls of Amrovir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">The Serum concentrations of calcium canalers such as Amlodipin, Dilenazem, Felospin pin, Nifipin pin, Nifipin pin, Niderpin pin, Ninsulator and Verapamil can be increased by Amblavir. thus, possibly the activity and toxicity of these medicines will be increased.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The simultaneous ingesting with asapase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations with PDE5 inhibitors in connection with side effects including hypotting, visual dysfunctions and priapism (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study, in the Ritonavir 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µg Fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days on promoters were significantly higher, while the endogenic cortisol rose by about 86% of the tank interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">Consequently, the simultaneous figment of Agenerase is not recommended along with these glucose raids, unless the potential benefits of treatment of systemic coronary cortical effects (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">At HMG-CoA-reduction inhibitors such as Lovastatin and simvastatin, whose comparisons depends heavily by CYP3A4, are pronounced enhancements of the plasmics in simultaneous administration of angenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since Plasmaspivotings of these HMG-CoA reduction shirts can lead to Myopathy including a Rhabdomyolysis, the combined application of these medicines is not recommended with amplavir.</seg>
<seg id="1991">It will be a prevalent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations up to stabilization of the mirror, as the Plasmakonzentrations of Cyclosporin, Rapamycin and Tacrolimus can be increased in simultaneous gift of amplavir (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, Agenerase can not be applied together with oral biased Midazolam (see section 4.3), while in the simultaneous application of Agenerase is offered with parentalem Midazolam caution.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data on the simultaneous application of parentalem Midazolam with other proters inhibitors to a possible increase in plasma cutting bar of Midazolam by 3 to 4-fold.</seg>
<seg id="1994">When methadon is administered together with Amtiavir, patients should therefore be monitored on opiatentment symptoms, especially if also low doses are administered by Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Because of the per se low reliability of historical comparisons, there is currently no recommendation to be given as the Amtiavir- dose to adapt simultaneously with methadon simultaneously with methadon.</seg>
<seg id="1996">With simultaneous gift of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants along with mapase, an increased control of the INR (International Regular ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of disabling or reinforcement of antithroom effects (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of Ritonavir on hormonal contraceptive pills cannot be predicted, therefore, alternative methods are recommended for contraception.</seg>
<seg id="1998">A careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended in simultaneous gift of agenerase (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">This medicine may only be used during pregnancy only after careful consideration of possible user's potential for the mother compared to the possible risks to the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">In the milk-activated Rowing were proven in Amtiavir-related substances, it is however not known to whether Ambitavir in humans are surviving in the mother's milk.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproduction study on top rats, which was administered by the nibulation in the uterus until the end of the lactation period of time, showed a reduced increase in the 12 body weight in the post-time period.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The further development of the income, including fertilility and reproduction capacity was not affected by the administration of Ambitavir to the mother tier.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The ambiguity of angenerase was studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with different other antiviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most with the angenerase treatment and side-effects were slightly up to moderate, appeared early on and rarely brought to the treatment breakage.</seg>
<seg id="2005">Many of these events are not clarified whether they are applied in connection with the intake of asgenerase or another at the same time to HIV treatment, or whether they are a result of the undermining disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the side-mentioned side effects are taken from two clinical studies (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which with prototyping patients were not treated 1200 mg Agenerase twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (degrees 2 to 4) specified by the investigator doctors as associated with the study medication, and in more than 1% of the patients occurred, as well as under the treatment applied laboratory changes (degrees 3 to 4) are listed.</seg>
<seg id="2008">The antiretroviral combination therapy has been associated with a redistribution of the body fat (Lipodystrophy) in HIV patients, including a loss of peripheral and faal lower fat tissue, increased intractable and visceral fatty tissue, hypertrophic of the breasts and dorsocervical fat collection.</seg>
<seg id="2009">Under 113, non-treated persons who were treated with Amtiavir in combination with Lamivudin / Zidovudin over a medium period of 36 weeks, was only a case (stiffed) (&lt; 1%).</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the study PROAB 3006, in the study PROAB 3006 performed in 245 million (3%) compared to 27 cases (11%) compared to 27 cases (11%) in combination with various NRTIs over a medium duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0.001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Skin rashes were usually slightly up to moderate-shaped, erythemed or makuloquitic nature, with or without itch and occurred spontaneously during the second treatment week and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without having to crash with Ambitavir.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Cases of Osteonekrose were reported in particular in patients with generally well known risk factors, advanced HIV infection or long-term application of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">With HIV-infected patients with severe immune defective can develop an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">With PI patient-treated patients, the 600 mg Agenerase has been observed twice daily along with low dosisted Ritonavir (degrees 3 and 4) those who were under alluties of the triglycerid- and CPK values, which received in patients suffering from generase along with low dosirudavir.</seg>

<seg id="2176">In all studies Aldara was compared with a placebo (same cream, but without the substance). • Aldara was tested in four main studies on 923 patients with warts in the genital area for 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2177">The main indebator for the effectiveness was the number of patients with complete precipitation of the treated warts. • Aldara was also examined in 724 patients with small basal cell disease in two studies where patients were treated six weeks and aldara or placebo either daily or five times a week.</seg>
<seg id="2178">The main indicator of the effectiveness was the number of patients with complete precipitation of tumors after twelve weeks. • Aldara was also tested in two studies in a total of 505 patients with acute keratosis.</seg>

<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α-L-Iduronidase and is produced by recombinant DNA technology using Cho-mammal-cell cultures (Chinese Hamster Ovary, Eierstock des Chinese Hamsters).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is for long-time enzymes in patients with secured diagnosis of a Mukopolysacchariot I (MPS I, α-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">The treatment with Aldurazyme should be done by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other hereditary diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can, if the patient is wearing this, every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and effectiveness of aldurazyme in adults over 65 years was not determined and for these patients can not be recommended a dosage scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Safety and effectiveness of aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver insuffsolvency was not determined and for these patients can not be recommended a dosage scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2291">With Aldurazyme treated patients can develop infusion-conditional reactions, which are defined as any given by side effect, which occurs during infusion or until the end of the infusion day (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially these patients should continue to be monitored carefully, and the infusion of aldurazyme should be done only in a proper clinical environment in which rebuoyancy devices are immediately available for medical emergencies.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase-3 study, we expect almost all patients of IgG antibodies against laronidase, usually within 3 months from the start of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of infusion-related reaction must be treated with caution when applying Aldurazyme with caution (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">As little experience exists in respect of the treatment after a longer break, due to the theoretical risk of an oversensitive reaction after a break of treatment must be cautious.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before the beginning of infusion with medication (antihistamine and / or antiPyretics) to minimize the potential of infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In the event of a light or moderate infusion reaction, treatment with antihistamine and paragliamol / Ibuprofen should be weighed and / or a reduction in infusion rate to half the infusion rate, in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of a single, heavy infusion reaction, the infusion must be stopped until the symptoms are brought to decrease, treatment with antihistamine and paragliamol / Ibuprofen is to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion can be added again with a reduction in infusion rate at 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate when the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (antihistamine and paraphramol / Ibuprofen and / or Corticosteroids) as well as a reduction in infusion rate at 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of infusion rate, in which the previous reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be applied simultaneously with chloroquine or Procain because a potential risk of interference with intracellular intake consists of laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Veterinary studies do not leave direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, the embryo / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since no data on newborns which were exponential to Laronidase over the mother's milk, is advised to satisfy during the treatment with Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">The side effects in clinical studies have been predominantly examined as infusion-related reactions, which were observed in 53% of patients in phase 3 study (treatment duration up to 4 years) and at 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (treatment duration up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Unwanted medication acts associated with Aldurazyme that were observed during the phase 3 years or older during a duration of 45 years or older during a treatment duration of up to 4 years, are listed in the following table according to the following frequencies: very frequently (≥ 1 / 10); frequently (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related participation of the upper airways and lungs in the history, there were heavy reactions to, including bronze pasism, respiratory and facial (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Unerdesired pharmaceutical effects associated with Aldurazyme, which were reported during a Phas- 2-study with a total of 20 patients aged 5 years, with predominantly severe delays and treatment duration up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously weekly (recommended dose), 200 kg / kg intravenously weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">In most patients it came within 3 months after the start of the treatment to a seroconversion, with the patient at the age of 5 years with a heavier decay times (average after 26 days over 45 days in patients aged 5 years and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Until the end of phase 3-3 study (or up to a premature departure from the study), 13 / 45 patients were not entitled to prophesible antibodies (RIP) assay assailable antibodies against, including 3 patients, where there has never been to seroconversion.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with lack of blood circulation are a robust reduction of GAG's spider in Harn, while in patients with high anti-embodiments a variable reduction of GAG in the harn was to be ascertained.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in the phase-3 study and one in phase 2 study) showed a marginal to small neutral effect on enzymatic laronidas- activity in vitro, which seemed to impair the clinical effectiveness and / or the reduction of GAG in the harn.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies seemed to stand in connection with the incidence of undesirable drug action, even if the appearance of undesirable drug actions typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies in time.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The rationale for the enzyme therapy is in one for the hydrolysis of the accumulated substrate and the prevention of further accumulation of adequate recovery of the enzymes.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion, Laronidase is quickly taken from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the Lysosomes, most likely about Manning-6-phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and effectiveness of aldurazyme were examined in a randomized, double-blind, placeboarding phase 3-3 study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study that were calculated the entire disease spectrum was the majority of patients from the middle phenotype and only a patient pointed the heavy phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had a forcized explicit volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary end-points for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FEV and the absolute walking path in the 6-minute- salary test.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were subsequently crushed for an open label study, where they received another 3.5 years (182 weeks) each week 100 E / kg Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with aldurazyme treated patients to the placebo group is an improvement in the lung function and the incapacity shown in the table below.</seg>
<seg id="2322">In the open reference study, an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects showed up to 208 weeks in derAldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and of 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group, as follows from the table below.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease of the expected percentage FEV is not significant over this period of clinically not significant and the absolute lung volumes increased further proportional to the height of growing children.</seg>

<seg id="2355">Alimta is treated with patients who have not yet been treated before, in combination with cisplatin and in patients who have previously received other chemotherapies.</seg>
<seg id="2356">To reduce side effects, patients should take during the treatment with Alimta a Corticosteroid as well as folic acid (a vitamin) and injections of vitamin B12.</seg>
<seg id="2357">When Alimta is administered along with cisplatin, should before or after the gift of cisplatin, in addition an "antiemetics" (medicine against vomiting) and liquids (to prevent liquefied gel).</seg>
<seg id="2358">In patients whose blood-image changes or when certain other side effects occur, the treatment should be decreased above, or the dose should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2359">The active form of pemetrexed leaves the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells divide.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The transformation of Pemetrexed in its active form goes easier to equip in cancer cells than in healthy cells, which leads to higher concentrations of the active form of the medication and a longer duration of cancer in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">For the treatment of malignant Pleuramesothelioms, Alimta was examined in a main study of 456 patients who had previously given no chemotherapy against their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-specific lung cancer, the effects of Alimta in a study were compared to 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease, which previously were previously treated with chemotherapy, with the effects of docetaxel (a different drug against cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta was also compared with gemcitabine (a further medicine against cancer), and both in combination with cilplatin in a study at 1 725 patients who had never received chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients who were treated with Alimta and Cisplatin, survived on average 12.5 months, compared with 9,3 months at the sole administration of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2365">In patients who had previously received chemotherapy was the average survival-time with Alimta 8.3 months, compared with 7.9 months at Docetaxel.</seg>
<seg id="2366">In both studies, however, patients in which cancer are not angulated the epithelium cells, during the administration of Alimta longer survival times than with the comparative medication.</seg>

<seg id="2376">During the seven days before the first dose of Pemetrexed must be taken at least 5 cans folic acid, and taking the intake during the whole therapy, as well as for further 21 days after the last Pemetrexed- dose.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients also have to receive an intra-muscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 micrograms) in the week before the first Pemetrexed dose as well as after every third payment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients who receive a complete bleeding should be created before every gift, including a differentiation of the leucocytes and one thread-symbols.</seg>

<seg id="2380">At the beginning of a new treatment cycle, a dosage examination needs to take place under Berbridging - saturation of the nadirs of blood or the maximum non-hematological toxicity of the predictable therapy cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After recovery, patients must be treated in accordance with references in tables 1, 2 and 3 which are applicable to ALIMTA as Monotherapy or in combination with ciline platinum.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC degrees 2 bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Should patients non-hematological toxicity may develop (except neurotoxicity), the therapy must be interrupted by ALIMTA until the patient is the value before treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">The treatment with ALIMTA must be canceled when patients after 2 dosages are a hematological toxicity or not-hematological toxicity or not-hematological toxicity or so- and on the appearance of degrees 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical studies have no indication that in patients aged 65 Yahweh, or in comparison to patients aged 65 years an increased secondary risk.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use with children under 18 years of age, due to not sufficient data for the ambiguity and effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical studies in clinical studies were necessary in patients with a creatinin Clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min no dosage adjustment necessary, which are recommended for all patients recommended Dosiscent.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data base in patients with a creatinin Clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore the application is not recommended (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients have been studied with a liver functioning of &gt; 1 km of the upper Bilirubin- Border value and / or Transamosis from &gt; the upper limit value (in the existence of liver cancer) or &gt; 5.0-kindle of the upper limits (in the presence of liver cancer) not specifically studied in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients must be monitored with regard to the button of garlic and pemetrexed may not be administered to patients prior to their absolute neutrrophileners once again reaches a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the Throsymbols again a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">A dosage reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of the absolute Neutral phileners, Throsymbols and maximum non-hematological toxicity, as observed in the previous treatment cycles - (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and reduction of degrees 3 / 4 hematological toxicity such as neutropenal toxics such as neutropenie, febb Neutropenie and infection with degrees 3 / 4 Neutropenie was bezzling if a pre-treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients must be dependent on Pemetrexed patients, folic acid and vitamin B12 as a prophestic measure for reduction-related toxicity (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to medium kidney failure (creatinin Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) must avoid the simultaneous ingsteroid Antiphlogistika (NSAIDs) such as Ibuprofen and Acetylsali- cylsacid (&gt; 1.3 g daily) for at least 2 days before the therapy, in the day of therapy and minde- Tens 2 days after therapy with Pemetrexed (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients, for which a therapy with Pemetrexed is intended to avoid taking NSAIDs with long half-value for at least 5 days before the therapy, in the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with Pemetrexed (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients in which these events occurred, they had corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of renal events, including dehydration pressure, pre-existing hypertension or Diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Therefore, in patients with clinically significant liquid supply - accumulation in the transcellular space a drainage of the drainage before the Pemetrexed treatment are weighed.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 severe cardiovascular events, including Myokardinale events, and cerebral events were reported in clinical studies with pemetrexed occasionally, when this substance is commonly administered in combination with another cytotoxic substance.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, the simultaneous application of attenuated substances (except yellow fever, this vaccination is contraindian) not recommended (see section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">As the possibility of a irreversible impairment is made possible by pemetrexed, men should be advised before the treatment of treatment - to obtain advice on sperm archiving.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal kidney function (Kreatinin Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) can lead to high doses of asteroid antiphlogistika (NSAIDs, such as Ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid (≥ 1.3 g daily) to a decreased pemetrexed excretion with the result of a multiply appearance of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Therefore caution is advisable when patients with normal kidney function (Kreatinin Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) are used high doses from NSAIDs or Ace- tylsalutacid in high dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen) or Acetylsalicyl- acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy, in the day of therapy and minde- Tens 2 days after therapy with pemetrexed (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">As no data is possible with respect to the Interaction potential as Piro- xicam or Rofecoxidib, the simultaneous application with Pemetrexed must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy, the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with pemetremixed.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The large intra-individual variability of the scent status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulants and antineoplastic chemotherapy calls for increased monitoring frequency of the INR (International Regular Ratio) when the decision was made to treat the patient - duck with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for the use of Pemetrexed in pregnant women, but as with ande- ren Antimberolites are expected in an application in pregnancy severe birth defective.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Pemetrexed may not be applied during pregnancy, except when necessarily earnings and after careful consideration of the utility for the mother and the risk for the foetus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">As the possibility of irreversible damage to the reproductive capacity due to Pemetrexed, men should be pointed out before the treatment course, advice on the sperm count.</seg>

<seg id="2609">The effectiveness of Aloxi can be increased by the additional gift of a Corticosteroids (a medicine that can be used as an antibody).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The application in patients under 18 years of age will not be advised, as to the effects of these age group does not have enough information.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the substance of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin), to the receptors in the intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was studied in three main studies at 1 842 adults who received chemotherapies which are strong or moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In chemotherapies, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting are 59% of patients who were treated with aloxi in the 24 hours after chemotherapy (132 of 223), compared to 57% of patients treated with Ondansetron-treated patients (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In chemotherapies, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting are, 81% of patients who were treated with aloxi in the 24 hours after chemotherapy (153 of 189), compared to 69% of the patients treated with Ondansetron-treated patients (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In a comparison with Dolasetron these values at 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">March 2005, the European Commission presented the company of Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. a permit for inclusion of Aloxi in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indicted: to prevent acute nausea and vomiting with strongly emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer disease and the prevention of nausea and vomiting with moderate chemotherapy due to cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The effectiveness of Aloxi about the prevention of nausea and vomiting that induces through a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy, can be strengthened by adding a given Corticosteroids.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Da Palonosetron can prolong the Dickdarmpassage, patients should be monitored with anamnesty obstructing or sign of a subacute Ileus after the injection pressure.</seg>
<seg id="2620">As with other 5HT3 antagonists, however, caution is provided with simultaneous gift of Palonosetron with medicines that extend the QT interval or in patients where the QA interval is extended or which tend to be an extender.</seg>
<seg id="2621">Except in connection with further chemotherapy agents, Aloxi is supposed to be used in the days of chemotherapy nor for the treatment of nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical trials, Palonosetron hied the activity of the five examined chemical activity of five examined chemical agents, Cyclophosphamid, Cyclophosphamid, Cycloabine, Doxorubicin and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical trial, no significant pharmacoinetic interaction between a unique intravenous dosage Palonosetron and a steady-state- concentration orical Metoclopramids, one CYP2D6 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a population based on a population based pharmacoinetic analysis was shown that the simultaneous gift of CYP2D6 inhibitors (Amiodaron, Celectron, Paroxetine, Chiniquiine, Chanitiine, Chanitiine, Sertralin and Terbinafin) did not have a significant impact on the Clearance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">The experience of using Palonosetron in human pregnancies cannot be used, therefore Palonosetron should not be applied to pregnant women unless it is necessary by the doctor's doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical studies the most common in a dose of 250 micrograms to observed side-effects (total 633 patients), who were at least possibly with aloxi in the context, headaches (9%) and obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitive actions and reactions of appointment (burning, hardening, complaints and pain) were reported in post-marketing experiences.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosing, similar frequencies showed themselves similar to unwanted events such as in the other dosing groups; there were no dosage of drugs to observe.</seg>
<seg id="2629">There have been no dialysis studies, due to the large distribution volume, however, a dialysis is probably no effective therapy with a aloxi- overdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomized colblinded studies, a total of 1,132 patients, which received a moderate chemotherapy with &lt; 50 mg / m2, carboplatin, &lt; 1,500 mg / m2 Doxorubicin and 250 kg / m2 (half-time 4 hours) or 100 mg Dolasetron (half-time 7,3 hours), which was given every day 1 without Dexamethason intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double blinded study, a total of 667 patients were obtained with ≥ 60 mg / m2Cisplatin, &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 Cyclocker and Dacarbazin, as well as 250 or 750 micrograms of Palonosetron, who were compared to 32 mg Ondansetron, which were given to 1 intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of the studies with moderate chemotherapy and the study with strongly emetogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical studies on the indication of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) were the effects of Palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including the QTc intervalls with the corresponding effects of Ondansetron and Dolasetron comparable.</seg>
<seg id="2634">After the predatory investigations, Palonosetron has the ability to block the ientricular de- and repolarization involved in the Ionian channels and extend the duration of the shareholder potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study conducted at 221 healthy probanden was assessing the ECG-effects of i.V. administered by 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After intravenous gift follows an initial elimination of the Plasmakonzentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average half-term half of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the area under the concentrations time curve (AUC0-) are generally proportional to the entire dosage range of 0.3 90 μ g / kg for healthy and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">After intravenous gift of Palonosetron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the average of 11 Hodenosetron-plasma cutting (± SD) increase in the Palonosetron-Plasmakonzentration at 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">From the pharmacoinetic simulations that the total amount of 0.25 mg Palonosetron reached total texposition (AUC0- the value) reached by 0.75 mg of total value (AUC0- the value of 0.75 mg measured) with the intravenous intravenous of 0.75 mg higher.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated through the kidneys, and about a further 50% are converted into two primary metabolic density, which have compared to Palonosetron about less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on 5HT3 receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies on the Metabolisation have shown that CYP2D6 and, in a lesser degree that Isoenzme CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the Metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After a intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron were refound about 80% of the dose within 144 hours in the urine, Palonosetron, as unaltered active ingredients made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a unique intravenous bolt of healthy, the total body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal Clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">While patients with severe liver function is increased the terminale Elimination reduction and the average systemic exposure with Palonosetron, however, a reduction of the dose is however not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical studies, effects were observed only after exports, which are regarded as sufficient above the maximum human therapeutic exposure, which indicates a small relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 From the clinical studies there are indications that Palonosetron can only block in very high concentrations of iteracy channels, which can be involved in the ventricular de- and repolarization and extend the shareholder period.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses Palonosetron (each dose discharged in approximately the 30s of the therapeutic exposure to humans), led to a growing frequency of liver tumours, endocrine Neoplasms (in thyroid, pituitary) and skin tumors by rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not completely known, but due to the used high doses and as Aloxi is determined by humans to one unique application, the relevance of these results has been low for humans.</seg>

<seg id="2660">June 2006, the Committee on Human Healthcare Panel (CHMP) adopted a negative credit, in which the approval of approval for the processing of hepatitis C envisaged by Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injecting solution was recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2661">"" "this means that Alpheon a biological medicine named Roferon-A should resemble an effective component in the EU (also called" "" "reference pharma" "" ")." ""</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long-standing) hepatitis C (one caused by an viral infection).</seg>

<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast into which a gene (DNA) was brought to the formation of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheon presented data which occupy the comparison of alpheon with Roferon-A (substance structure, composition and purity of the medication, active, safety and effectiveness at hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study to patients with hepatitis C, the effectiveness of alpheon has been compared with the effectiveness of the reference product to 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study was measured how many patients after 12 out of 48 treatment weeks as well as 6 months after the treatment of the treatment said (i.e. no sign of the virus in the blood).</seg>

<seg id="2669">Furthermore, concerns were raised, that the data for the stability of the substance and of the market-based pharmaceutical drugs have not been sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients with hepatitis C, which spoke to treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A, was similar in the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After the treatment of the treatment with Alpheon, the disease has ressed more patients than with the reference guide; moreover, Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from that, the test to investigate the question is to what extent the drug is an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine), not sufficiently validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It may be applied to the treatment of Impetigo (one with crushed skin infections) and small inexplications (cracks or snaps), abrasions and sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo does not need to be used to treat infections caused by ethicillinresistant sthylococcus aureus (MRSA) because algo against this type of infections may not affect this type of infections.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be applied in patients aged nine months, but in patients under 18 years of age, the skin surface may not be more than 2% of the surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not address the patient after two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient once more and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial reef (the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced) and inhibits the growth of the bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of the effectiveness in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was cleared after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients under placebo on the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">When treating indoors the Altargo and Cefalexin similar response: when the results of both studies were taken together at Hautwunden, about 90% of the patients between the two groups were applied to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">However, in these two studies, however, that Altargo was caused during the treatment of waste (eited hollow spaces in the body tissues) or of infections caused by MRSA, not effective enough.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side-effect with Altargo (which was observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is a stimation at the Principle.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Humiliary (CHMP) to conclude that the advantages of Altargo during the short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections in relation to the risks outweighed: • Impetigo, • infected small infirings, abrasions or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission presented the Glaxo Group Company Ltd. a permit for intraffic of Altargo across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients in which two or three days no improvement shows, should be examined even once and will be considered an alternative therapy (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In case of awareness or serious local irritation by applying retapamulin Salbe the treatment should be canceled, the salbe carefully inspected and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection can be started.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Reapamulin is not intended to be used to treat infections in which MRSA is known as pathogens or suspected (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical studies at secondary open wounds, the effectiveness of reapamulin was caused by patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy is to be considered when after a 2- to 3-day treatment no bettering or deterioration of the infected site occurs.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous application of Retapamulin and other topical means on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous application of other topical medicines is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low plasma concentric concentrations, which have been reached by humans for topical skin or infected superficial wounds, is a clinically relevant shirt in vivo not expected (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After simultaneous gift of 2 times a day 200 mg Ketoconazole increased the average retapamulin AUC (0-24) and Cmax to topical application of 1% retapamulin salbe on a chopped skin of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the small systemic exposure to topical application in patients may not be required if topical reapamulin is applied during a systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproducing stoxicity after oral intake and are inadequate in regards to a statement on the birth and the fetal / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Reapamulin Salbe should only be applied during pregnancy, when a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicative and the application of Retapamulin is the gift of an systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">When deciding whether the breastfeeding is continued / terminated or the therapy with Altargo continues / ends, is reduced between the benefit of breastfeeding for the infant and the benefit of the Altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical studies at 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, the Altargo was applied, the most commonly reported side effect on the occasion of the arrival, which amounts to approximately 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Active postapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivatives of Pleuromutilin, a substance, which is isolated by fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly Pleurotus passeckanus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The active mechanism of Retapamulin is based on selective inhibiting of bacterial protein synthesis with interaction at a particular connecting point of the bacterial Ribosoms, which differs from the ties of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicate that the hybosomales Protein L3 involves and is located in the region of the ribosomal P-connecting location and the PeptidyltransferasezCenter.</seg>
<seg id="2701">Through liaison at this connecting point Pleuromutiline the Peptidyltransfer, blocking partly P-binding interactions and prevent normal formation of active 50s ribosomaler underunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">Should be noted on the basis of the local prevalence of resistance to the use of Retapamulin in at least some infection forms, a consultation should be pursued through experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in the In-vitro activity of reapamulin to S.aureus, irrespective of whether the isolate resistant or resistant to methicillin were.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In the case of non-responsive to the treatment at S.aureus should be considered the presence of tribes with additional viral factors (such as PVL = Pong Valentine Leucocidin).</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study involving healthy adults was charged 1% retapamulin salbe daily under occlusion to intact and deported skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">From 516 patients (adults and children), which won 1% retapamulin salbe twice daily for 5 days to the topical treatment of secondary uninfected wounds, individual plasma cutting has been won.</seg>
<seg id="2707">The sampling took place in days 3 or 4 in the adult patients each prior to the medication and in the children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic intake involving human subjects after topical application of 1% Salbe on 200 cm2 chopped skin (Cmax = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) 660-times lower than the Retapamulin IC50 for the PGP Hemp.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro oxidative Metabolism from Retapamulin in humanised liver microsomen has been primarily conveyed by CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies for oral toxicity on rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were conducted over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used for the protection against hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases that affect the liver) in children between a and 15 years that are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is applied as part of one of two doses existing vaccines, whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after administration of the second dose.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix is allowed to only be used when the immunisation is a low risk of hepatitis B infection and is ensured that the vaccine can be ended from two doses to an end.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresher dose against hepatitis A or B is desirable, Ambirix can be delivered or another hepatitis B or B vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines effect by bringing the immune system (the natural defense of the body), "as it can against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">After a child has received the vaccine, the immune system detects the viruses and surface antigens as "foreign" and generates antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same components as which has been approved since 1996 has been approved Vrix adults, and has been approved since 1997 for the registered vaccine Twinrix children.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines used to protect the same diseases, however, Twinrix adults and Twinrix will be administered as part of one of three doses existing vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix includes adults identical ingredients, some of the data that supports the use of Twinrix adults, also used as a testament to the use of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of the effectiveness was the proportion of vaccinated children, which had developed a month after the last injecting a protective antibody concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children, the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared to a six-month and a 12-month gap between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix conducted between 98 and 100% of the vaccinated children a month after the last injection for the development of protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection from Ambirix had similar to a Seal and 12-month gap between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed with more than 1 of 10 vaccine) are headache, loss of petitiveness, pain on the injecting location, redness, matology (fatigue) as well as irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not be used in patients, which may possibly be hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other components or Neomycin (an antibiotic) not to be applied.</seg>

<seg id="2743">3 As with all injections should be available for the rare case of an anaphylactic reaction after the gift of the vaccine, corresponding opportunities for medical treatment and monitoring are always available immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardization scheme with the Combinational Wizard is recommended, which contains 360 ELISA units of formal hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B-surface.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In emmodifying patients and persons with malfunctions of the immune system, there will be no adequate anti-HAV- and anti-hbs antibody, so that in these cases the gift of further vaccines can be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since an intradermal injection or intra-muscular administration could lead to a subsistency success, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">With Thrombocytopenie or bleeding disorders, Ambirix can be injected without exception, since it can occur in these cases after intra-muscular gift to bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If Ambirix was administered in the second life year in the form of a separate injection, Tetanus-, azellular polomyelitis- and Haemophilus influenza vaccine (DTPa-IPV / Hib) or with a combined masern- mumps vaccine, was the immune response to all antigens (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients with immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defects must be assumed that may not be sufficient immune response.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study conducted with 3 vaccinations of this formulation was carried out in adults, the frequency of pain, redness, swelling, gastroenteritis, headaches and fever comparable with the frequency, which was observed in the former thieves and preservatives.</seg>

<seg id="2752">In a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 to including 15 years, the compatibility of Ambirix was compared with that of the 3-doses combinant.</seg>
<seg id="2753">Only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and matness on a calculation base per vaccine Ambirix, but not on a basis basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the gift of Ambirix at 50,7% of the probanden, compared with 39,1% at the probanden after the gift of a dose of 3-doses of combinant.</seg>
<seg id="2755">After the complete vaccine-cycle 66,4% of the bananas, the ambirix had received, over pain, compared to 63.8% at the probanden who have been vaccinated with the 3-dosage combinations.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of Matfulness was comparable to a proband (i.e. over the entire vaccine cycle at 39,6% of the bananas, the ambirix got, compared with 36.2% at the probanden that received the 3-doses Combinations).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency distinctive pains and adfastness was low and comparable that, which was observed after administration of the combinational vaccine with the 3-doses scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study at 1- to 11-year vaccinations, the appearance of local operations and general practitioner in the Ambirixgroup was comparable with that, with the 3-cans combined hepatitis C-A virus and 10 µg recombinated hepatitis B-surface antigen was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2759">At the 6- to 11am, however, according to vaccination with Ambirix, however, was reported a frequent appearance of pain (at the injecting location) per dose, not per proband.</seg>

<seg id="2767">In individuals who were at the time of Grundimmunisation between 12 and 15 years old, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-hbs antibodies could be proven at least 24 months after the immunisation with ambitions in the 0-6 months scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immunogenic reaction against both antigens was comparable with that, according to vaccination by 3 doses with a combinant resin, consisting of 360 ELISA units of formal hepatitis B-surface antigen in a dosage volume of 0.5 ml has been established.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical trial at 12- including 15-year-old, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-hbs antibodies to be compared 24 months after immunisation in 0-6- months vaccine is comparable to that in 0-12 months scheme.</seg>

<seg id="2805">Based on the data, which have been known since issuing the first approval for the settlement, represented the CHMP opinion that the benefit-risk ratio for Ambirix remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since Ambirix has only been placed in a member state (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this medicine is limited due to low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonaps can also be used in patients aged over a month with incomplete enzymfaulty or with hyperammontmixer (brain) in history.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonaps is - divided into several single pants at meals - swallowed to be mixed at food or via a gastrostomieschl (by the abdomen into the stomach of leading hose) or a nose-sonde (through the nose in the stomach of leading hose).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study since Ammoneaps could not be compared to any other treatment or with placebo (a hypomedial medicine, i.e. without substance).</seg>

<seg id="2811">The Committee for Humanitarian Therapy (CHMP) to conclude that Ammonaps in patients with disorders of the inary cycle to high ammoniacces are effectively prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "Ammonaps was approved in" "" "extraordinary circumstances" "", "because due to the rarity of the illness at the time of admission only limited information about this medicine." ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indigenous to all patients with which a complete enzymatic organ has already manifested in the newborn age (within the first 28 days of life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a belmanifixed form (incomplete enzymdefect, which manifests itself after the first life month), there is an indication for use when in the anamnese is a hyperammonary.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are not able to swallow tablets or for patients with slip-disorders is AMMONAPS also available in granular form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is individually calculated considering the intolerance and the development of the daily protein intake of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg and in Herangrowing and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">In patients suffering from an early manifeste lack of carbylphosphate synthetase or ornithinocarcarbylase, the substitution of Citrullin or arginine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with an arginine synthetase deficiency have to get arginine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets should not be administered patients with difficulty disorders, as a risk for the emergence of osophagululcera, if the tablets are not immediately coming into the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2,7 mmol) sodium, accordingly 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore be used in patients with congestive heart failure or severe kidney failure as well as with sodium and indemise clinical conditions only with caution.</seg>
<seg id="2823">As Metabolisation and excretion of sodium phenylbutat over the liver and the kidneys occurs, AMMONAPS should be used in patients with liver or kidney failure only with extreme care.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contrasting (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">With subcutaneous types of phenylacetate to young sprouts in high dosage (190 - 474 mg / kg), it came to a slowing of neuronal contraction and a stolen loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">It also found a delayed maturation of cerebral synapses and a reduced number of functional neurons in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be determined if phenylic acid is eliminated during men into the mother's milk, and for that reason, the use of AMMONAPS during the lactation period (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS, at 56% of patients stood at least an unwanted event (AE) at 56% of these undesirable events it was assumed that they were not connected with AMMONAPS.</seg>

<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18 year old abnormative patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in connection with Lakacacia socket, severe hypotheology, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of overdose entered at a 5 month old small child with an accidental individual dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms go with the accumulation of phenylacetate that showed with intravenous administration of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day a dosistive neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolized active compound, which is contrasted by acetone with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine, which is eliminated through the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Sturchiometrically seen is phenylacetylglutamine with urea comparable (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for excretion of surplus nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disturbances of the urinary cycle can be assumed that for each gram they are biased sodium phenylbutat between 0.12 and 0.15 g Phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that diagnosis is early and the treatment is immediately started to improve the survival chances and the clinical result.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early-manifeste form of the disease with appearance of the first symptoms in the newborn age was almost always infaust and the disease led even in treatment with peritonealdialysis and essential amino acids, or with their pins free analogue within the first life year to death.</seg>
<seg id="2838">Through Hämodialysis, the utilisation of alternative ways of nitrogen cooling (Natriumphenylbutat), proteinbenzootate and possibly substitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of newborn at postpartal (however, within the first age of life) diagnosed with 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were already treated before the first appearance of a hyperammonary encephalopathy, the survival rate was 100%, but even in these patients came with the time with many to mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a belmanium form of the disease (including female patients with the heterozyginal form of the orniotic transcarbylase deficiency), which were treated by a hyperammonary encephalopathy and then treated permanently with sodium phenylbutat and a proteinated diet, the survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible in treatment and in some patients may occur a further deterioration of the neurological condition.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrat is oxides to phenylacetate, which is conjured in liver and kidney enzymsch with glutamine, with phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrat and its metabolic disease in plasma and urine have been determined according to Gabe healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the urinary cycle, the hemoglobalized, and with liver cirrhosis after retail and repetitive gifts of oral cans by up to 20 g / day (non-controlled studies).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrat and its Metabolites was also examined in cancer patients according to intravenous gift of sodium phenylbutat (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral single dose of 5 g Natriumphenylbutat in tablet form were determined 15 minutes after ingesmeasurable plasmakonzentrations by phenylbutyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urinary cyclical disruptions or hemostbinies, after different doses phenylbutyrat (300-650 mg / kg / day to 20 g / day) will be no phenylic acid in the plasma.</seg>

<seg id="2885">In patients suffering from a PCI, Angiox was just as effective in terms of all indicators just like heparin, except for heavy blood vessels, where it was significantly more effective than slparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox must not be used in patients who may possibly be hypersensitive (allergic) against Bivalirudin, other shepherd or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may also not be used in patients who recently had a bleeding, as well as with people with strong hypertension or severe kidney problems or a heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Humanitarian Therapy (CHMP) to conclude that Angiox in the treatment of ACS and during a PCI a decent replacement for sparin is.</seg>
<seg id="2889">September 2004, the European Commission presented the company The Medicines Company UK Ltd. a permit for inclusion of angiox in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronarsyndromes (instabile Angina / non-lever locks (IA / NSTEMI)) at an emergency stop or if an early intervention is provided.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initialdose of Angiox in patients with ACS is a intravenous bolt of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If a PCI is executed in other words, an additional bolt should be given by 0,5 mg / kg and increases the infusion for the duration of the surgery on 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">After the PCI need for clinical requirements, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be added for 4 to 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Immediately before the procedure, a bolting of 0.5 mg / kg is administered followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the Rhinoplasty.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of angioox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intravenous bulb of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and one another immediately subsequent intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of a allotus hub of Angiox was not examined and is not recommended, even if a short PCI procedure is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">Is this value (ACT after 5 minutes) on below 225 seconds, should be a second bulb of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the appearance of low ACT values, the reconstituted and diluted medicine should be carefully mixed before the application and the Bolusdosis is rapidly administered.</seg>
<seg id="2899">Once the ACT amounts to more than 225 seconds, a further monitoring is no longer required, provided the 1.75 mg / kg Infusiondose is administered properly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate kidney kidney (GFR 30-59 ml / min) that are subjected to PCI (whether with Bivalirudin against ACS or not), a lower infusion rate should be used by 1,4 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Lies the ACT value below 225 seconds, is a second bulusdosis of 0.3 mg / kg and the ACT 5 minutes to consider after the second Bolusdosis.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate kidney damage, which resulted in the phase III- PCI study (replace-2), included in the phase Ivalirudin-Bolus without dosage adjustment at an average of 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 In patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also in dialysis patients, Angiox contraindications (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">The treatment with angiox can be initiated 30 minutes after completion of the intravenous yeast in or 8 hours after completion of the subcutaneous casting of low-molecular sparin.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• better known hypersensitivity to the substance or any other components or against Hirudine • active bleeding or increased blood circulation. • severe uncontrolled hypertension and subacute bacterial endocarditis. • severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and dialysis patients</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of a bleeding, especially when Bivalirudin is administered in combination with another anticoagulant (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even when in PCI patients suffering from Bivalirudin most bleeding in arterial point can occur in patients suffering from a perutaneous coronarser (PCI), during the treatment in principle everywhere bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients who are taking care in and treated with Bivalirudge, a monitoring of the INR Werts (International Regular Ratio) should be considered to ensure that the value after insertion of the treatment with Bivalirudge should be achieved before the treatment existing level.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Starting from the knowledge of the active mechanism of antibodies (Heparin, warfarin, Thrombolytics or thysymbols) can be assumed that these substances increase the blood danger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In combination of bivalirudin with thrusting cylinders or anticoagulants, the clinical and biological heretic parameters are regularly monitored on a regular basis.</seg>
<seg id="2911">The experiments are inadequate in terms of effects on pregnancy, the embryo / fetal development, which is insufficient or the postnatal development (see under section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomised to Bivalirudin alone, 4604 were randomised to Bivalirudin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and 4603 were randomised to either unquestionable Heparin or Enoxaparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">Both in the Bivalirudin group as well as in patients with yeast treated as well as patients over 65 years of age, more than 65 years later than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Serious bleeding were defined according to the ACUITY and TIMI standards for heavy bleeding like in the footsteps of table 2.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both light and heavy bleeding occurred at Bivalirudin alone significantly less often than in groups with Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitors and Bivaliprinters plus GPIIb / IIIa- Ininhibitor (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An ACUITY heavy bleeding has been defined as one of the following events: intoxicular hematoneal, intraocular bleeding blood levels of ≥ 3 g / dl with a known bleeding point, reoperation due to a bleeding, application of blood products to transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">More, less often observed blood-localizations, which occurred with more than 0.1% (occasionally), were "other" points, retroperitoneal, gastroman, ear, nose or neck.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following information on side effects are based on data from a clinical study with Bivalirudin with 6000 patients who subjected to a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Both in the bivalirudin group as well as in patients with yeast treated as well as patients over 65 years of age, more than 65 years later than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both light and heavy bleeding occurred among Bivalirudin significantly less often than in the comparative-group under Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects which are not listed above were reported after comprehensive application in practice and are arranged according to system organs sorted in table 6.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In case of overdose the treatment with Bivalirudine is to disrupt immediately and to monitor the patient with regard to signs of a bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains Bivalirudin, a direct and specific Thrombininhibitor, which binds both at the catalytic centre and the animate region of Thrombin, irrespective of whether Thrombin in the liquid phase or at Gerinnsel is bound.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The bond of Bivalirudin to Thrombin, and therefore its effect, is reversible because Thrombin on the one hand decreases the bond of Bivalirudin-Arg3-Pro4, causing the functioning of the active center of Thrombin regenerates.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, through Bivalirudin with Serum of patients, where in the past it was come to heparinduced Thrombosis / heparinduced Thrombosis syndrome (HIT / HITTS), not inducing Thrombodied state-action.</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy implants and in patients Bivalirudin shows a dosis- and concentric dependence of anti-dependent anti-dependent anti-dependent anticated effect, which is occupied by the extension of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">In case of a PCI for the patient, an additional bolt should be given by 0.5mg / kg Bivalirudin and increases the infusion for the duration of the surgery on 1.75mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2928">In the arm A of the ACUITY study, unquestionable Heparin or Enoxaparine was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coronarsyndrom (ACS) in patients with instabiler Angina / Non-ST-lever (IA / NSTEMI).</seg>
<seg id="2929">Patients in arms A and B were also randomized to receive a GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor either before the beginning of the angiography (at the time of Randomisation) or on PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2930">In the ACUITY study, the characteristics of high risk factors, which required a angiography within 72 hours, evenly distributed over the 3 treatment arms.</seg>
<seg id="2931">About 77% of patients had a recurrent Ischgl, 70% had dynamic ECG- changes or increased cardiac biomarker, 28% had diabetes and about 99% of all patients undergone within 72 hours of a angiography.</seg>

<seg id="2938">The 30-day results, based on four and triple-end points of a randomized double blind study with over 6,000 patients who are subjected to a PCI (replace-2), are shown in table 10.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Clinical studies with a small number of patients supplied limited information on the application of angiox in patients with HIT / HITTS.</seg>
<seg id="2940">The pharmacoinetic properties of Bivalirudin were evaluated in patients who subjected to a perutaneous Koronarser (PCI) as well as in patients with ACS.</seg>
<seg id="2941">It is expected that Bivalirudin as Peptid expects a catabolism in its amino acid components with subsequent revaluation of the amino acids in the body-pool.</seg>
<seg id="2942">The primary metaboite, which results from the division of the Arg3-Pro4 bond of the N-terminalen sequence through Thrombin, is not effective due to the loss of its affinity to the catalytic center of Thrombin.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra will be used to treat adults, adolescents and children from six years with diabetes that require treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apse is subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the thighs or tharm injected or administered as a continuous infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to control the glucose pile (sugar) in the blood or can not process the insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin pulisin distinguishes itself very slightly from Humaninsulin, and the change means it is faster and a shorter activity has as a short-effective humaninsulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was used in combination with a long-effective insulin in patients with type-1 diabetes, in which the body can not produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In type-2 diabetes, in which the body insulin can not be effectively processed, apidra was examined in a study with 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of the effectiveness was to change the concentration of the substance glycosyliulated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood, which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study with adults with type 1-diabetes, after six months a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) compared to a reduction of 0.14% at Insulinlisper.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type-2 diabetes the reduction of HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with an apidra compared to 0.30% in human-normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra must not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) against insulin pulisin or any of the other components, or in patients who are already suffering from hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of apidra may need to be adjusted when it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission presented the company Sanofi-Aventine Deutschland GmbH a permit for the settlement of Apidra throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Antidra is considered subcutaneous injection either in the area of the abdomen, the upper hole or the delusion to apply or subcutaneous due to continuous infusion into the area of abdomen.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the decreased gluten-hardness capacity and the diminished insulin delivery, the insulin needs to be down in patients with a restriction of the liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of substance, the brand (Her- actors), the insulin pyps (normal, NPH, zinkdelayed etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the manufacturing method can draw a change of insulin demands.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 A insufficient dosage or disruption of treatment, especially in patients with a insular diabetes, may lead to a hyperglycaemia and a diabetic Ketoazière; these conditions are potentially life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The changeover of a patient to another insulin type or insulin of another manufacturer should be carried out under strict medical supervision and may make a change of the dosage needed.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The timing of hypoglycaemia depends on the efficacy profile of the used insulin and can therefore change in the conversion of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2983">Among the substances which can increase the blood sugar-bearing activity and increase the inclination to hypoglycemic acid (ACE) -Hemmer, Disoxetine, Fluoxetine, pentoxetine, provocalist, gealizations and Sulfonamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, under the effect of sympatholytics such as frauds, Clonidine, Guanethidine and reserves the symptoms of the adrenergen counter-regulation will be weakened or absent.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Veterinary studies for reproducing stoxicity showed no differences between Insu- linglulisin and Humaninsulin in relation to pregnancy, the embryo / fetal development, the birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether Insulinglulisin into the human mother's milk survives, but in general the insulin occurs neither into the mother's milk, nor is it resorated after oral application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Below are the clinical trials known from clinical studies, grouped according to system organs and sorted by decreasing frequency of their appearance (very frequent: ≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10.000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000); not known (frequency on the basis of availability).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold-welding, cool and pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiety, nervousness or weakness, confusion, concentrations, bency, overexcessive Hun- GER, changes of tendowls, headaches, nausea and heartbeat.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy Wird fails to switch the injecting location within the injection range, can occur in the sequence a lipodystrophy to the injection position.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Serious hypoglycemics with unconsciousness can be treated by means of intra-muscular or subcutaneous injection of glukagon (0.5 to 1 mg), which is given by a trained person, or treated by intravenous gift of glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After a gluten development, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the urine thing for the heavy hypoglycaemia and avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin lowers the blood sugar levels by the stimulation of the peripheral glucose intake (especially by skeletal muscles and fat) as well as the inhibition of the glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in subcutaneous gait is done faster and the active time is shorter than with hu- manem normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study with 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type-1 diabetes melli- TUS showed insulin pulation range from 0.075 to 0.15 E / kg, a disproportionate increase in anger effect, just like Humaninsulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulinglulisin has a double as fast effect as normal Huminsulin and achieves the full swing effect about 2 hours earlier than Huminsulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">From the data was obvious that in an application of insulin pulisin 2 minutes before meal, a comparable postprandical control reaches like with humanic normal insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">Became insulin pulisin 2 minutes before meal - it became a better postprandial control than with humanic normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Will insulin insulinglulisin 15 minutes after the meal - will be a comparable glycemic control such as human-normal insulin, which is given 2 Mi- nuns in front of the meal (see picture 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin lulisin Gabe 2 minutes (GLULISIN - previously) before the beginning of the meal in comparison to humanic normal insulin, which was given 30 minutes (picture 1A) as well as compared to humanic normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes (normal - previously) before a meal (figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin pulisin at Gabe 15 minutes (GLULISIN - retrofit) after the beginning of the meal compared to humanly Nor- malinsulin, the 2 minutes (normal - previously) before the beginning of the meal (figure 1C) was given.</seg>
