if a part of the text is selected , only this part of the entire &amp; URL will be translated .
machine translation is only very ru@@ di@@ mentary . bab@@ el@@ fish produced in the best case a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense . therefore , ten@@ ders should not be dependent on the translations without checking the translation beforehand .
only web pages on the Internet can be translated . other texts should be translated on the bab@@ el@@ fish page itself , where you can insert text directly .
the package &amp; package includes various modules for &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; in spite of their small size , they provide some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions of &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; by making this easier available .
further information about the use of &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ;
to load these modules in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; select settings extensions setup .... open the map card tools and select the desired modules .
this is a list of standard modules from the package KDE ; add @-@ ons . please note that there are more modules on your system if you have additional software installed .
you should install the package base , which &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you compile this package .
to use the crash module , click in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; on extras exhau@@ st . then you can view the page , the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; for crash , or the list of st@@ umps , if present , extingu@@ ish .
the module filter filter ( also called folder filters ) can be reached in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under extras filters . with the module you can filter &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s up @-@ to @-@ date working directory on different types .
to view the DO@@ M @-@ Components in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; select extras DO@@ M @-@ tree show ... and thus opening a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed web page . as a default , the display begins with the root bar of the document , sample : the element element , all the other no@@ des are sub @-@ elements of this root canal .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides a further view of objects with the MI@@ ME Type O@@ ode / directory for local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different toolbar and text views to view the content of your local file system .
the peculi@@ arity of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists in it , t@@ anned folder @-@ hierarch@@ ies using a so @-@ called Tree map . each object is characterized by a rectangle whose surface is proportional to its size . this size must own the property that the sum of the sizes of the lowest objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
at &amp; FS@@ View ; reflects the size of a file or folder , whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . therefore , large files can be easily detected when it is far down in the folder hierarchy . therefore , it can be seen far down in the folder hierarchy . therefore , it can be seen as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command &apos;s command you will be considered .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; an entry in the Tre@@ pointer representation is a rectangle that represents a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . to simplify navigation , the right corner of meaningful shades and labelling settings .
the color of a rectangle that is switched off according to color mode , can either depic@@ ting depth for the slight detection of the detection zone or illustration of another file , such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type .
a rectangle can be lab@@ eled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each property you can specify , if enough space is to display at all or whether the surface of subordin@@ ate rectan@@ gles is to be used or if the area may occur when signs of the stair@@ way ) . in addition , you can specify the relative position of the sign@@ ment in the rectangle .
at Dar@@ fur algorithms for Tre@@ em@@ aps should be observed that the surface is proportional to the size of the entry . at the Tre@@ ons in &amp; FS@@ View ; this target will not always be observed . however , this framework will no longer be available , which is then lost the subordin@@ ate entries . please note that less space is lost for the frame if the rectangle is square .
as division of the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries will be carried out , the implementation remains to be applied to the surfaces so that sp@@ ells are created , which are as square as possible . the best methods in this respect are lines , columns or recur@@ sive lines .
you can indicate the minim@@ ally presented area for an entry over the menu entry view . instead , a spac@@ ecraft is drawn into the area of the higher @-@ level entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry .
originally , &amp; FS@@ View was designed as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets which was developed for the application K@@ C@@ ach@@ egr@@ ine .

an easy to use camera presence will be provided to help you connect with your digital camera and your photos directly in &amp; check @-@ albums are supported . of course , each medium and every card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; checking ; working together .
&amp; checking ; contains a quick image processing with basic tools tools . you can use this to review your photos , comment , evaluate and correct . the machining ability can be easily expanded with KDE Image plugins interface ( manual ) modules .
although &amp; D came ; easy to use it makes it d@@ aying professional skills available . it works completely in the 16 @-@ bit color foam and all available modules support the raw conver@@ ters using li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG export and ICC @-@ colour workflow - workflow .
improved database with much more metadata , such as eg ; about the camera or the lens , which can be searched for .
like all &amp; KDE ; programs is also &amp; digi@@ tization ; an open source project . that means it is based on the support of the end users . you should therefore report problems and improvement possibilities .
&amp; Check came ; tries to make the milking menu as easy as possible for them . wherever you are in the program , the help menu provides an entry menu or wishes .... This will open a dialog with a subordin@@ ate link . if you use this short@@ cut , your web browser opens a page in the error correction system . all required information Are you registered here . just follow the instructions to send your report .
&amp; checking ; is a project that is supported by a community . that means that the user and developer came to each other . if you come to a regular user of &amp; checking ; then we would like to answer you questions to other users of &amp; checking ; however , you can answer here questions to other users of &amp; checking ; however , you may soon have questions to other users . in this mailing list , you should therefore be powerful in this language .
you can also visit the digi@@ tization ; homepage to visit news about shared versions and other information about &amp; checking ; to experience .
the best start to get involved in &amp; checking ; is the registration in the developer mailing list . instructions for sale in the developer &apos;s mailing list from &amp; checking ; .
if you start &amp; digi@@ tization : for the first time , you will be asked where you want to store your pictures and your database . simply enter a local , remote or remote folder . just enter a local , remote or remote folder . just enter a folder name or click the folder icon to select a folder .
in the second field you have to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data entry is stored . this path remains the same for all image folders .
later , you can add a lot of folders like you want to add . &amp; checking ; will you additionally use as an Al@@ ben@@ library . settings &#124; K@@ am Set@@ ting Colle@@ ctions
if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive , you can specify the top folder , the images contains , as the base folder . &amp; checking ; considers every sub@@ folder as an album . no picture will be changed . during the passage of the folder you will get a progress @-@ to @-@ show like this :
&amp; Check came ; dur@@ al recur@@ sively the Bibli@@ oth@@ ek@@ path@@ way in its entire depth . you cannot shut down any sub@@ folder , unless it was i@@ ste in a hidden folder . this allows you to add an exceptional folder . this allows you to insert a point in front of the name of the sub@@ folder .
if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ ds do not take photos as symbols . you can change the photo by using any photo from the album and take this on the folder icon . you will find more details about this in the section albums .
once you have configured the base folder , you can set up &amp; Check ; your digital camera setup . after that , you should learn how to use My albums and My key@@ hole to manage your photos in the albums .
Roh@@ dat@@ ing@@ support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , so it can handle . possibly the support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out whether a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the menu help pipe support .
how to set up this and work with raw files in the sections of Ro@@ le @-@ Dec@@ oder@@ settings and Ro@@ h workflow .
an easy to use camera presence will be provided to help you connect with your digital camera and your photos directly in &amp; check @-@ albums are supported . of course , each medium and every card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; checking ; working together .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IEE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . the camera will then be implemented as USB mass storage device . the camera can also be implemented via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deri@@ vatives . older cameras are used in circumstances to connect the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; checking ; used the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 for communication with digital cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 is also supported the Picture Transfer Protocol , a common protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows transferring pictures from digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need for additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . since photos in general are large files and transmis@@ sions about the serial port are slowly , this connection is now outdated . &amp; checking ; supports these cameras and guides the transmission of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must have been created with li@@ tig@@ x@@ if support so that the thumb@@ nails will not be read by some lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 camera machine to read the thumb@@ nails . if the EX@@ IF support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you will probably be able to say nothing or the generation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things in &amp; digi@@ tization : is how simple its functionality can be expanded by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the KDE Image plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; checking ; , K@@ Photo@@ album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide the modules to all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way , as it can also be a user . your advantage is that it is much simpler , &amp; checking ; by writing a small module to supplement a function than the changes in &amp; digi@@ tization ; even perform .
to simplify the window , you can either remove the page with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ trl + Shift + F .
drag and drop images from anywhere : you can take an image in a different part of the Al@@ ben@@ bau@@ ms , above the horizontal separ@@ ating line or into another type of use . the only restriction is that a picture is not in keywords , file list or search .
- a file selection allows you to extract the most common : JPEG , PNG , TIFF , Ro@@ h , movies and audio
the text filter is used only for the fields that are currently displayed in the toolbar . so the filter on the fil@@ ename is displayed only when this ind size screen will also appear . which fields can be displayed in the dialog of the Al@@ ben@@ evol@@ ent .
the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view on your photographs . these albums can be saved in a single night@@ tree . these albums can be saved on the hard disk after the name of their collection in the Al@@ ben@@ Properties or following the date when the album was first created , sorted . the date may be changed into the features of the album .
if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . select Album Im@@ por@@ ting Pictures . you can also add a scre@@ enshot directly to an album . select Album Im@@ ported Screen foto .
to copy or move a picture from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse on the target album and drop it down . in that then , you can select whether the image is moving through moving or copying . simply select all photos and move it to the target album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the album features to provide you with information about this collection . to access the album settings , you must click on the album and select the menu button in the context menu .
Alb@@ um@@ - Kolle@@ ctions : are a method to select your albums , so that you can select your photos by selecting from the toolbar or view albums . if you want to add new collections or delete albums , you can make this in the settings for collections .
the Alb@@ um@@ - Date : is used when you sort your albums by date with view albums by date .
the buttons El@@ t@@ ester , average , New Year : this set the date on the one of the oldest , the latest image or the average of the album . this is first attempts to calculate the average of images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , instead the date of the last modification will be used in this folder .
if you first opened an album in &amp; Valley , the first image in the album is as a symbol of the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; selected . this will help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to choose another photo as a symbol .
to select a different photo as an album icon , you must click on the image with the right mouse button and select in the context menu &amp; quot ; As Alb@@ um@@ vor@@ schau , select . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
an album can always be included in a collection and collections cannot be wast@@ ed .
&amp; checking ; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the area My list button on the left below in the main window . album collections have another effect . to the collection always include all photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
the image window provides you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all images are displayed in this album in the image window . each photo will be displayed in a preview window , you can customize the size of this occurrence with the two lou@@ enk@@ ines in the toolbar .
when you open an album the first time , you need to wait short while the thumb@@ nails will be generated . this allows you to avoid when you use the thumb@@ nails again in the menu .
information about each image are displayed below the corresponding preview below . which information these are , you can change about settings ; set up here . select the albums page and adjust the thumb@@ nails to your wishes .
the thumb@@ nails are equipped with help windows that are available . if you let the mouse pointer a moment to rest over a picture . the help shows the main properties including all the keywords of a photo . the screen shot up in the section introduction to the main window shows such a help window .
photos are all designed to organize it at &amp; Fitness . albums and keywords will allow you to organize your pictures as it fits . you can reach all the functions that can be done with &amp; checking ; you can easily reach the context menu of preview or the menu picture in the menu bar . you can choose between viewing the images , a slideshow or the editing of images .
you can open the image processing with a photo by calling the F@@ 4 image editing ... or selecting the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and select Edit ... you will find a guide on how to edit your photos . with the image editing you can view your photos and change them .
it may happen that &amp; checking came ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in a different program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and select the program from the menu type . click on this and how to adjust them to your needs if your program is not re@@ counts , you will find information in the &amp; KDE manual .
you should note that it is possible after processing through other image processing programs with the data contained in the image . some programs do not store this data with off when you save the modified image . this means that this information is lost from EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aper@@ ture etc .
&amp; Check came ; puts two possibilities to turn your turn . the easiest way is to select and select with the right mouse button on the thumb@@ nail . in the sub@@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the fil@@ ename of a photo , you can click with the right mouse button on the preview and select F@@ 2 ren@@ aming from the context menu . note that you maintain the extension ( .@@ jpg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) .
if you start a photo from &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ff , it will be moved in the du@@ st@@ bin of &amp; KDE ; postponed . f@@ 8 picture Del@@ ete or Ent@@ f If you prefer really delete , you can use this by using Shift ; Ent@@ f .
the view &amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ sli@@ ste@@ quot ; organizes your photos from the data . &amp; checking ; used either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of the last modification of the file .
once you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the data sheet below in the data collection , so that you can only show the photos of the selected days .
photos with keywords provide a flexible and powerful opportunity available to organize your photos and cat@@ alo@@ ging . keywords are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned individual photos or whole groups . once a key@@ word was assigned to a photo , the photo can be found in the selection of this sample or a search again .
if a key@@ word is selected , all photos , which were marked with this key@@ word .
tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . here you can also organize parts of the Tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ word quot ; together , so you can find the keywords that you are looking for , easy to find .
the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and weigh@@ ted key@@ word in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG . so you can use your keywords when loss of database re @-@ imported as soon as &amp; checking ; the images noticed .
you can add new keywords by clicking with the right mouse button either on &amp; quot ; My key@@ word quot ; or to an existing key@@ word , then select a new key@@ word , after you clicked on an existing key@@ word , this becomes a sub@@ word of this key@@ word .
you can delete a key@@ word by clicking the key@@ word with the right mouse button and select Del@@ ete . if you delete a key@@ word , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the key@@ word is removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a keywords by moving it to the desired position in the tree and place there . then a menu that gives you the possibility to push the key@@ word . a key@@ word can be at a time only once in the tree .
you can change the properties of a keywords by clicking it with the right mouse button and edit in the context menu key@@ word . you can change the name of the keywords and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ word quot ; change .
to select a different photo as an album icon , you must click on the image with the right mouse button and select in the context menu when album preview . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
to deal with key@@ word ; s functionality with keywords can handle , you must first draw your photos with keywords , you can draw on the appropriate key@@ word in the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ word quot ; drag and drop them there . alternatively , you can also click with the right mouse button on the preview of the images and select from the context menu key@@ word .
you can choose a photo with any number of keywords . the photo will be displayed as soon as you choose one of the keywords of the keywords . in this way you can choose a key@@ word for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event , where it was made , etc .
once you have provided a photo with keywords , this will display the image of the picture in the main window .
you can remove a key@@ word in which you click with the right mouse button of the photo and select from the keywords menu . the menu shows you only the keywords which have been assigned to the photo .
the time @-@ beam view shows a time depending on the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be moved through this h@@ ist@@ o@@ gram . to select a time frame , you just have to click on the lower right @-@ rectangle of the selection frame that displays the time unit . thus , all the corresponding images are displayed in the main window .
in the field below you can enter a title and save your selection . it then appears in the list below .
cover all elements of the database : names , ratings , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , data controller and in the future even more .
Neb@@ ras@@ er Search box is a small lamp that is green when the search results . if you click here , the filtering is deleted and all the images are displayed again . if the search has not found anything then the lamp is red .
the advanced search tool is hidden in the rider on the left side@@ bar with the tel@@ esc@@ ope . if you open this you get a simple search box as described above . you can search this search here but as live search , which always fil@@ tered out what you entered as a search criterion . after you saved the filter you have been saved in the list .
if you are satisfied with your selection , press the head OK and the search is done . the results are displayed in my search list in the main window . if you want to change your request a name in my search list , you just have to select the appropriate entry from the view of My search list and select a option in his context menu .
if you want to edit search , the form to enter the search will be added again . if you want to edit any advanced search , the dialog appears for the extended search to change your previous search . here you can find more rules for searching . further information can be found in the Advanced Search section .
if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select in the context menu screen .
the Advanced Search will provide you with an extended search form with many search@@ parameters available with which you can search in certain fields of &amp; Check ; s database .
the list of the search rules will be used to add the options for a search query in the Alb@@ end@@ aten@@ bank . each option can delete the search request . any option can be added with others about the logical operations All ... , One ... or minimum ... link . in addition , you can customize the type &amp; quot ; AND NI@@ CH@@ T@@ quot ; create .
&amp; checking ; character@@ izes each image by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows it to compare images by comparing these sig@@ natures . the lower the difference between two pic@@ sig@@ natures , the more they correspond to . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is an area where you can drop each image to find a similar . by means of a spon@@ ge , the result selection can be extended or res@@ ized . if you move a picture from anywhere on the icon of the un@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , then it will open and you can drop it there .
sketch : free hand @-@ color sketch : draw a quick sketch and &amp; digi@@ ous ; find the matching pictures . also here a spon@@ ge can be set .
this rider provides an intuitive approach tool available based on the margin of mouse button or push it and move and move . move it while you click the left mouse button . press C@@ trl ; lin@@ ker Maus@@ kno@@ b to pull a square . all pictures within this coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . this will naturally pres@@ upp@@ oses the your pictures ge@@ o data .
in the field below you can specify a name for your Ge@@ o Filter . this will then be added to a later use of the list below . it works like a Live Geo@@ folder .
&amp; checking ; presents a lumin@@ osity in a separate window available with which you can easily compare images . he works with all supported image files , also raw files .
choose one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ trl ; L D@@ em lumin@@ osity added from the context menu . the selection will be added to the table image and open its window again . if you come back in &amp; checking ; main window are , you can open the lumin@@ osity quickly with L extras
from the thumb@@ nail you can drag the images you want to compare , in the left or right area of the window . if you preview them to see which copy in which window area is visible . if you can preview them out of the toolbar icons , then they are also executed in the other picture . you can thus compare the same area of the two pictures .
another mode is better suited to capture quickly from a picture series . now you use the left mouse button on any thumb@@ nail to view it in the left pane . the right adjacent picture is displayed in the right pane . this makes it easier to work through a number of similar pictures .
of course the normal sol@@ dering actions are also working directly from the table as e.g. F@@ 4 file .
all image information from the right side bar of the main window are available for both thumb@@ nails at the table . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
at the bottom of each range you will find a built @-@ in swing function , which you recognise in the crossed arrows . to locate the visible area of the picture , you need to click them and the &amp; L@@ MB ; pressed . in the mode preview are then both pictures the same image area .
the zoom works just as in other views . simply use the zoom regul@@ ator under the pictures or C@@ trl ; mouse wheel to zoom in and out to zo@@ oming . this happens in both pictures when you are previ@@ ew@@ ed in the mode .
what is a digital component management - away from the mo@@ de@@ word ? digital matter @-@ management considers each part of the process , following the actual output and permanent storage . each of the photos takes , sc@@ anned or digital photos stores a form of digital component management through . most of us do not make this in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to secure your images , you will find and use photos again . we look at downloading , ren@@ aming , secure , review , des@@ per@@ ately , optimize , maintain , wait and export image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital component management takes on , indi@@ cted , categorized , secur@@ es , ass@@ ures , transforming , assembled and exports contents that have a mon@@ ary or cultural value hab@@ en.@@ quot ;
metadata are defined as data about data . metadata according to your definition data that provide information about or documentation from other data provided by an application or environment .
I d@@ are to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you need not even know how many photos you have , then use it certainly not &amp; digi@@ tization ; then the approach to save metadata both in a database as well as in image files guarantees very fast search and a safe archiving to which you can access with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you do and need to know before you need anything into your system is the building information structure in contrast to the data structure . your image files must somehow be organized on your computer . you need to decide whether other access to your photos are to be saved or on a network drives &amp; etc ; make sure you have to switch to a larger drive at some time .
maybe you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can quickly be found in one year several times in the same place . if you make enough photos then you will use sub@@ folders like &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; use it then a folder for pictures that you print or publish on a website .
professional photographers have other requirements such as ver@@ sion@@ ing the photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant supply of images on different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % Archive and 5 % work@@ files will have and you will then not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content .
which types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the st@@ ackable processing simpler . separate new ones from old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or derived picture .
we also recommend the option to store metadata in the settings page of the metadata in &amp; checking ; this ensures that Ex@@ i@@ f@@ - and IP@@ TC data are written into the file . if you forget this , then you can save the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the relevant item in the menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what is to change ? how did the metadata editor used for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important .
now the real work begins , as you should now select any photo keywords , cap@@ tions and a rating . of course you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value then . you start the best with the review or the ranking . this makes sense , as you can concentrate on the best photos at work .
let &apos;s now let ourselves with keywords , keywords , as you are often hot in other programs or categories . all three are syn@@ onyms for the same thing .
if you import the alo@@ gical images from another source with embedded keywords , then it will automatically insert the tree for you b@@ z@@ w the images to the right place . the sort of hierarchy inside the tree is no problem and can simply be done by moving an underground to another . the changed keywords are being pursued by &amp; checking ; updated during it the sub @-@ trees .
the graphic shows how different metadata may be over@@ cut . this is a very gro@@ be re@@ presentation because every block of metadata in truth consists of many sections . fil@@ ename and calendar data features characteristics of all images .
enough the keywords - the next section relates to cap@@ tions or comments , the third important tool to cataly@@ tic your metadata .
you just want to let most nobody see your photos simply , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies . they are certainly interested in making your photos .
take a look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it closer then you start to see some details , people , the place .
and now I say to you this of the Lan@@ de@@ platz of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing is . wow ! you start to dream , associations , memories , the historical time period is present again , you may even listen to the silence . the cap@@ tion therefore has changed your perception of this panoramic position .
for others who consider your photos may possibly be more important than the picture itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is it the importance to the viewer to help Him over the mo@@ tive that she moves to understand what you understand .
it is fine when an image is not perfect if it &apos;s the strength to work only with a let@@ tering for themselves .
with &amp; checking ; you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alized alphab@@ et ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) , as let@@ tering . you can even export it to your wishes in the cap@@ tion and / or the title of the web @-@ gallery system . you need to tell you the story so for the opening of the Web gallery .
do you remember the times before GPS ? as you had to find in another city without navigation system ? was it not a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now already starts with light speed .
the possibilities to take advantage of the haz@@ ards are already innumerable and will be able to open in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future you can open your trips virtually using geo@@ graphic data . this then shows the photos at the entrance place . you can also export the pictures at the entrance place . you can also export the images to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flickr &amp; etc ; with the Goo@@ gle@@ Maps viewer .
&amp; quot ; Copy@@ left is a vocabulary with copyright and den@@ otes the practice to use the copyright to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same freedoms also apply in all modified versions , so also for the work of others .
the following description tells you what information in the interior page of &amp; Check came ; when information should be deposited :
author ( Syn@@ onyms for Er@@ ror and author ) : this field should add your name , or the name of the person who has created the photo , e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer , then the name of a company or organization is used , it should not be changed anymore . this field does not support Kom@@ ma nor sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ator .
author ( Syn@@ onyms for Ver@@ fibre ) : linked to the author . examples of this field contains the work name of the photographer . examples of this can be titles like : employee photographer , freelance photographer or Independent commercial photographer . since this is a note to the author , this must be as well filled .
Editor ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the provider field to identify who the photo offers . this does not necessarily have to be the author . if the photographer is currently listed for a news agency like Re@@ uters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations can be listed here , then the image / agency the image will offer the image here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although this cannot provide protection against misuse . anyone who has a little more than basics in working with calculator can delete or change it . the solution to this problem are digital water@@ mark . for private individuals this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and half professionals , this protection is very important against it .
the digital water@@ mark is unique in each image . &amp; checking ; will provide such a module for st@@ ackable processing in the near future .
topics : record @-@ errors , plate breakdown , rap@@ ids , EC@@ C , transmission errors , aging of storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , life time , temperature , data size , spread super@@ sti@@ tions
of course , we do not talk about CDs that have been lost on the road or a fire . this kind of loss are the same that you can happen in traditional paper pictures or neg@@ atives . in this section it is about problems in the so @-@ called new media .
K@@ roll On@@ track , the largest data recovery company in the world , has some interesting statistics which causes a data loss .
to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs they need to be treated longer than a few years . of course you can also keep CDs and DVDs in archiving quality . of course you can claim CDs and DVDs in archiving , more difficult and more expensive . there are offers about gold coating DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece that claim a life time of 100 years for themselves . whether you believe that is in your refreshment room .
CD / DVD discs can be in@@ readable , but you can use this risk in which you use good disper@@ ses and good recording devices and store them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write a lot of reliable . so it is about selecting the proper pick .
CDs and DVDs are very sus@@ cep@@ tible to errors , even if you were just written . therefore , they use a control panel mechanism to protect themselves . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for form@@ atting and control . despite this massive protection they are required by chemical aging , ul@@ tra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc .
for def@@ ective CDs and DVDs , there is a more favorable program called I@@ so@@ be@@ ster that apparently causes miracles on CDs and DVDs . it also runs on Windows and &amp; Linux ; it is also not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read the damaged data from damaged flo@@ ppies , HDDs , Flas@@ h@@ media , USB drives , etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to win the For@@ mat@@ ing War against HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray Disk can save 50 GB and thus almost sixteenth the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8,@@ 5 GB . all that was said to CDs and DVDs also applies to Blu @-@ ray disc .
burn slowly with a good reception device on high quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ated format . read afterwards the media with a description , date &amp; author marks and after that on a clean , dark dry and protected spot shel@@ ters . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read these media .
disk manufacturers retain your statistics for yourself . your manufacturer guarantees include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the troubles@@ hooting of hard disks : dis@@ miss study
shortly : Dis@@ ks keep on the longest if you are operated in the temper@@ ament range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C . however , electronic parts of the Contro@@ ll@@ ers are the most common fault of error , SMAR@@ T does not notice these errors . some of SMAR@@ T fixed bugs announce the immediate end @-@ case . these are especially readers and publisher . the expected lifetime period is between 4 and 5 years .
this is only the complete ver@@ ste due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also have data loss due to a black@@ out before you have secured the files , but these losses can normally be produced without big problems .
while most electrical equipment does not constitute a lot , it looks different with devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processors . these can cause severe damage . at your computer these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause , complete data loss , hardware , destructive mother@@ boards and other def@@ ective . thus , you protect yourself from the in@@ avoidable that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most widespread protection against black@@ outs is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs a part of the energy @-@ heat and absorbed the rest . it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ bar . however , you think not every plug @-@ in bar also contains an over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should be careful that he meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a particular minimum of protection . you should also take careful attention to protecting the bl@@ ending device and thus protects the properly connected devices .
since an over@@ voltage of each cable can use to your computer , you should be careful that even all the periph@@ er@@ als may be connected to your system . some manufacturers present a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connectivity options for the co@@ axi@@ al cable of the cable mo@@ de@@ ms and TV card .
if you have a notebook then you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially developed for not@@ ebooks and therefore also contain the protection for the modem . thus , you are ideal for travelling .
while an over@@ voltage protection of your system will protect your system prior to smaller fluctu@@ ations in the mains lines , it will not really help you with a complete loss . even a failure of few seconds may lead to loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in a br@@ ittle free power supply .
in addition to protection from over@@ voltage , these devices can automatically move cordless energy . this gives you the possibility to save your data and running the system . some models allow them to work even further up to the stream . if you buy a US@@ V then you should be sure that they are the same quality requirements like an over@@ voltage protection . in addition , the lifetime of the battery and the attached software is interesting .
concerns the potential risk that your billing system is exposed and and compare its safety in power disorders with the cost of avoiding this . a 500@@ W US@@ V can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 20 . this is just a small price difference if you &apos;re thinking about how well your computer is protected . at the end you should always think all cables before you drive to the holidays .
the Amazon Web Service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple memory service . with the right configuration you can use this as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is a further popular offer with which you can store any amount of data .
they are very expensive compared to the hard drives , although very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you have to send the data about the compar@@ atively slow Internet .
the solutions are therefore only a solution against a local data loss of the most important pictures . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general solution . it is too slow .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flickr ( Yahoo ) and the Photo @-@ Community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are not available on photos . their professional version provides you more available to you in case of Flickr dramatically . for $ 25 per year you get unlimited memory , which should be checked in reality .
from the perspective of data backup , the Web @-@ solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically agreed with the TCP protocol and included in the large firms in the offer a backup and a partial memory . thus , they are des@@ ast@@ er@@ sure .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer . all transfers are pr@@ one to transmission errors . the file system Z@@ FS and b@@ yp@@ fs make at least the data integral between operating system and hard drive safely .
the worst thing is that nobody says if a transmission error occurred , not when this happened in your hardware . all these disorders remain un@@ discovered until you have been able to do a photo . no one seems to have thought it &apos;s inside your computer . no one seems to have thought on it . the Internet with his TCP protocol is a much safer data path than the one in your computer .
un@@ reliable power parts are another source of transmission loss as they create inter@@ fer@@ encing within the data streams . on normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not particularly affected by transmission issues , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes per year .
Z@@ FS from Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates that are able to deal with record errors in low level and is available under one to the GPL in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it is soon also available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows released this article in English .
Oracle has started its own initiative with its b@@ yp@@ fs file system . this is still in the Alpha status . it uses the same protective mechanisms using the Z@@ FS and is also available for &amp; Linux ; however , it is not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss in the notebook and 46 % with the job @-@ systems . with not@@ ebooks , the proportion of th@@ ief is 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most des@@ erts . it leads to a lower damage , such as theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users just know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no longer has been sigh@@ ted for a long time .
open source file systems are less sus@@ cep@@ tible to data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , cancellation , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to call the common file systems . a very good English article can be found here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and loss of data : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden interruption during an operation is higher and an in@@ defin@@ ately state is avoided . however , if a file was not saved before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : wrong , theft , and human errors are the root causes of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings from fundamental physical boundaries . meant that the technology is further developed , there is a natural border for this progress . sensitivity and noise character@@ ization for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 meg@@ ap@@ i@@ x@@ el@@ s . even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and high quality optics are the optimum size for compact cameras . even DSLR cameras have your border with 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ ap@@ i@@ xel . for higher resolutions you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive you get today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not take anyone else for data loss . so you can save your data frequently after a plan and test this backup before you make some dangerous like the new installation of your operating system , the exchange of plates or the size of hard disks .
suppose you make daily your back@@ ups on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a bolt suggests you are lucky when the drive was not connected to the moment .
a disaster proposes local and destro@@ ys a lot . forget flight time : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous for your data . they usually concern a whole room or the entire house .
therefore , deser@@ tion does not always mean a local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stairs into the neighboring house , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of the physical separation : as stated above is a common reason for data loss despite backup the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files that are to be secured . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differentiation : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete list . generates a complete snapshot of two time points : the complete assurance and the final difference .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . you can restore the original status at any time in which such a backup was made . this backup comes down from a ver@@ sion@@ ing system next with the exception that it is only ab@@ rupt and not continued .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . in contrast to script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts , r@@ sync only the difference of the files that were really changed . this happens compressed and if you want to increase security via s@@ sh .
secure important images directly after you have saved your computer to a DVD or other optical medium .
this approach will allow you enough time to discover and restore losses and restore . at the end you will have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , of a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month . each additional th@@ inner should be done manually after which you have made a complete review .
topics : metadata , stored in the image file stored IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , original store , scal@@ ability , media , reuse images and metadata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , views ... , use of the Internet .
so that valuable pictures will survive the next 40 years that is about the time span in which you are really interested in you because they remember your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be noticed :
since the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature , you need to consider everything today with caution and evaluate while the current system is running . every 5 @-@ 8 years you should ask yourself like the current system back@@ wards . the less variations you have used in the past , the more easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtu@@ alization is nowadays available for everyone . so if you have an old system that for reading your pictures is important , then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the specialized pressure for the possibility to change a system in its size . this is actually increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you plan the scal@@ ability with your plans and the area that you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition . with * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and transfer the onto a new record :
check with the command d@@ m@@ g , whether your new record was detected by the system , but you do not hang it .
&amp; Dollar ; dd if / dev / sd@@ b # Source is / dev / sd@@ c # Source , the new record is / dev / sd@@ c &amp; dollar ; size of the record in MB@@ b ; # works with ext@@ 2,@@ 3 , fatal 16 , 32 and travel ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of travel if necessary
open Source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day does not have any software , you can read it , then you can create them yourself . this task will come from year to year .
GIF is a proprietary , patented format disappears slowly from the market . you should therefore not use it anymore .
PNG was developed as an open source standard developed to GIF . however , it can be much more . it &apos;s more lu@@ st@@ freely , supported X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 @-@ bit data for improved color@@ ations for hetero@@ geneous platforms . the disadvantage is that there are relative many administrative information , but not as many as TIFF , and have a slow compression . this format we would like to recommend you to save your images .
TIFF was widely used as image format . TIFF can store pictures in high quality , but needs very large files . with some cameras you can store your images in this format . however , there is more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The Digit@@ ale Neg@@ ative file format is a licence @-@ free and open raw material that has been developed by Adobe Systems . it is based on the TIFF / EP format and comm@@ its for the use of metadata . a handful of camera manufacturers are already available now and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon at some time .
this is possibly one of the reasons why in 2001 , Adobe has introduced XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a label technology that allows users to enter into a file itself . the file information will be stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .@@ x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers prefer to archive an original of your recording , mostly in the raw format , to archi@@ ved . X@@ MP does not fit the raw material from the image file , but it can be noted in the link between the metadata file and the image file . therefore , you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as a container and put everything there .
the Dublin Core Met@@ adata initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards , which includes a large range of application and modelling , discussions and collaborative work in the D@@ C@@ MI communities and the D@@ C@@ MI working groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and clari@@ fications to reach a wide acceptance of metadata standards and practices .
import images from the camera , the map or the scanner . for as long as the pictures on the camera , you can use this as a temporary backup .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save it in your raw archive . this function is not yet implemented .
for a hos@@ tile processing , you can use external programs again . if you start the pictures again with &amp; checking ; then you should add the metadata again . these have been cut down from the other programs .
protect the edited images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . only export them into web galleries , encoding in MPEG , use in contact sheet , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ tization . in the section adding a photos to an album you will find a description how you can add photos , which you already have on your hard drive , but the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings to replic@@ ating images to your album database .
to use your digital camera with &amp; checking ; connect them to the computer , turn the camera onto the display mode and turn it . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , it is trying to connect with your camera . if the connection is made , a he@@ ap indicator appears at the bottom and the thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera will be shown . some cameras do not display thumb@@ nails . if this is the case , the fil@@ ename and a symbol for the file assignment is displayed for each file , photos , movies , music etc. on the camera .
before you download the photos on your computer , you might need the camera information to each entry . with the page properties and metadata from the camera interface you can see the properties of an item or metadata .
this dialog displays file properties and the photo information that can be saved internally by the camera . a symbol shows that the image has not been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not provide all information .
the rider metadata shows the internal metadata such as EX@@ IF , manufacturer &apos;s remark , GPS etc. of the image . this information is the same as in the metadata side@@ bar from the main window of &amp; checking ; or the image editing . note that this metadata are not available for some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button Download and then download the selection from All . this loads the photos deleted from their camera into a single album and we recommend to check if the pictures were downloaded from the camera before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you do not want to download all photos , you can only select the desired use with the standard optional methods of &amp; KDE . once you select the photos , use the button download and then download the selected file . the button selected will be selected until you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , an option is New download@@ able . these images have not been downloaded from today until now . in this case , the new pictures are marked with a star in the preceding line . if you choose this option , the new pictures will be downloaded .
if you can download the buttons All download or select the selected album , a dialog appears with which you can select the target album , displayed like normal folder , displayed in section My albums . then select the target album out of the list and press OK .
after you have selected the target album , press OK , and it came out ; loads the photos from the camera into the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all at once by del@@ eting the button Del@@ ete . if you just want to delete some , then you need to select this first and delete the selected file .
note that there is no possibility to restore photos , which you have deleted from the camera . so you should not verify whether the photos were successful in a &amp; check @-@ album , before you want to delete them from the camera . if you want to delete them from the camera . if you want to delete the camera via camera , this is much faster .
cameras use as a file name for the photos often not particularly meaningful names . the fil@@ ename are usually deleted once again , after the photos were deleted from the camera . therefore , it can be useful to integrate photos of different records to the same album . therefore , it can be useful to integrate the date and time when the image was made to integrate into the fil@@ ename .
in the next section you will find options for rotating and mirrors of the image and to date @-@ based under@@ lining . if you use this latter option , automatically a folder is created each day .
the options during transmission opens three more options to be performed before the photos are stored on the plate . the first two concern the data from the EX@@ IF data contained in the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct the date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
if you wish to use another file format than standard format , you can e.g. use the Pre@@ fix Photo@@ graphic % - % S : % M : % S : % S . if you want to add the option date &amp; time . for further adap@@ tations you should read the help of the command strate .
if you use the Option Camera fil@@ ename , you have the option to change the fil@@ ename in small letters . or in case letters you prefer .
the new file name , the &amp; digi@@ ous ; used for a photo , is displayed below the name that provides the camera in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming will be saved and automatically used when you open the camera window next time .
&amp; checking ; can use all the information on the orientation of the camera to the time of recording to perform an automatic rotation during downloading . not all cameras provide this information . in the section side@@ bar metadata you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo .
the automatic rotation is usually switched on , and if your camera did not provide this information , the photo is in the original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic spin , use the button and select the Automatic rotation at the bottom of the window .
if your camera has been made information about the date in which the photo has been made available , it can be automatically loaded on the image data . all pictures with the same date are loaded into the same sub@@ album . not all cameras provide this information . in the section side@@ bar meta @-@ data you can re@@ read which information your camera could have embedded in the photos .
this option is usually switched off , and in this case stores &amp; checking ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change it , you need to switch this option . use the button @-@ based under@@ lining at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to load photos from your computer to their camera is the button Download . then select Upload . the file sel@@ ector dialog &amp; KDE ; appears in which you can select the files that can be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; KDE ; methods .
after the selection has been done , queries &amp; checking out ; you where the images are to be loaded up . a folder selection dialog for the camera appears . select the desired folder and click OK to start the up@@ loading . the images are not deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . it is a position that can be displayed in long@@ itude and l@@ atitude , which can be displayed on a map . identification of data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European Galileo or any other system .
not only for professional photographers can link it interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical place . not everyone uses a plane to use an area through automatic recording of GPS data to cart@@ o@@ graphs . environmental plann@@ er , military , police , architecture offices and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you have forgotten exactly where exactly the photo was done , you can then click on a browser which shows the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ tization ; user want to send the location of the photos thus locate , it &apos;s good to share the position data of a photo .
the question is how do the GPS data come into the image ? first , you should know that exi@@ v@@ 2 is supported in these fields ? there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , about a post @-@ processing of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical attri@@ bution ( manual ) and finally about the manual input of known places .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few that work with GPS receivers . either as a ticket module or through transfer of data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye iP@@ A@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR ri@@ oh Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with g@@ p@@ sman or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . however , you need to store this data in the g@@ p@@ x format , since this is the only format that is supported by the module for geographical assignment .
there are different programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract the data from pictures and from GPS . on the following page you can make the same under &amp; Linux ; g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and l@@ atitude or other data , then you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool of Phil Harv@@ ey . it uses the characters included , such as map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle .

the IP@@ TC actions save the data into the corresponding IP@@ TC field . it is achieved that the metadata are permanently included in the image and not only in the database of &amp; checking ; these metadata are also available in other programs and can be imported into &amp; digi@@ tization ; imported without lost .

&amp; # 160 ; checking ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ tization . view , you can add the file extensions of this list and remove . each file in a &amp; digi@@ tization ; Alb@@ um@@ folder that has no such extension ; ignored ; ignored .
the default settings can be reset again by pressing the button refresh right of each category .
the settings of the lumin@@ ance of &amp; checking ; can be switched on this page to the default values . however , some images have different sizes and the syn@@ ch@@ rone mode then is not available . the option &amp; quot ; In the whole image size you &apos;re using ; if you have one , then you can obtain better viewing results .
by default , the image editing a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select them here . you can use the toolbar button when you use the toolbar in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dar@@ ker or brigh@@ ter color in the image . these colors are specified here . in the image editing , this accumulation can be used with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 and are switched off .
Chro@@ ma sub@@ stitution is meant that the images are co@@ ded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the color information . please read this article in Wikipedia about the full explanation .
using the adjustment of PNG @-@ compression you can reduce the size of PNG . this operation is not reducing the image quality because PNG . the only effect is that the image data requires more time for training and packaging . if you have a quick calculator , you can put this value on high compression . this means 1 : a low and 9 a high compression .
with the option of TIFF files , you can switch the de@@ fl@@ ate com@@ pres@@ sion@@ ers for TIFF images . this reduces the size of the TIFF images . it does not reduce the size of the TIFF images . it does not affect the image quality , since the de@@ fl@@ ate algorithm operates freely .
with the adjustment of the free JPEG @-@ 2000 files , you can freely store the ratio between quality loss and file size far better than in the normal JPEG . when this paragraph was written , metadata are not yet supported , but it was in the planning .
in previous versions of &amp; checking ; the image processing only was an image asset for photos . currently , it develops very quickly to a tool to manipul@@ ate your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of the image processing .
the default value is that all green pixels are identical . if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimum loss of details . this option features a little soft , eliminating but the 2@@ x@@ 2 G@@ ather pattern with the V@@ NG@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method .
when this option is set , the white @-@ off camera is used immediately . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used .
this setting is only used when the white is not set @-@ off . standard is it a fixed color balance sheet that was photographed on a white map which is photographed in sunlight .
this setting is supported only for Fu@@ ji Super CCD S@@ LR cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images in four steps more details can get in the sh@@ red@@ dish . for other cameras this option will be ignored .
the standard is it the sh@@ ame@@ ful , so the parts of your images are burned down , due to the in@@ ability of your camera to view the sh@@ ame@@ ful results , as it shows the cutting edge in various ro@@ oft@@ ops . finally , you can try to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the sh@@ red@@ dish .
this is possible because blue pixels in general are not so fast s@@ ati@@ fied as green and red . and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing and red @-@ share from the still not saturated blue pixels . of course this is a question of how much colour or white you want .
if you choose the option to construct the option , you get the possibility to set a level . here is a value of three a compromise and can therefore be individually adapted to each image .
set the L@@ umin@@ anz@@ ance after your taste . you probably need to put it slightly higher than the standard 1 . but this can also be done later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ tization ; but this can keep the time for the dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing small , you should proceed more conservative .
a dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the divi@@ ding data , which provides many cameras and which provides a matrix color pixel . this algorithm is also known as CF@@ A inter@@ pol@@ ation or color construction .
&amp; Check came ; and D@@ rac@@ w provide you three alternatives available : Bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gradient ) was the first algorithm that was used by D@@ los@@ w . but it produces color@@ art@@ works on the edges . Bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result .
if you know the color devi@@ ation of your lin@@ sen you can put the rot@@ or and blue @-@ proo@@ fre@@ ading values here . this is certainly the best method for a color correction , since you are carried out during the raw conver@@ sions .
a profile translate the color information and returns instructions like this . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ tization ; information such as the colour information from a color tree in the others are to translate the colors as accurate as possible .
behavior issues when a picture is opened in the image processing / colour module with raw files .
color profile folder S@@ elling here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC / / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you can store all of your profiles .
settings of ICC profiles you have here the possibility &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ad ; for your profiles to deposit . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later .
the coloring view is an alternative compared to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are just your images color@@ fully manages not the entire screen .
the input profiles should fit to the camera manufacturers and model that you are using . not all profiles are included in the same type . there are some , such as Canon , which does not contain color @-@ tone mapping or gam@@ ma correction . this means that you need to perform the color @-@ tone itself .
there are other options like the Soft Pro@@ of profile , with which you can em@@ ulate how your image is given back from one device . this is very useful before you print image , because your printer can have a smaller shade as your camera and some colors therefore can be very saturated . this could be manually correct , instead of getting on the blind algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras it is quite obviously which color profile is intended for them for which . unfortunately , not with the models of Canon . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is of course in@@ official :
the Canon profile extension can detect the style for the target : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for fin@@ ral , P for portrait and S for standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is that &amp; KDE ; image plugin interface . it is an interface supported by a number of &amp; KDE ; images and pic@@ tured work@@ ings . many modules support they have been written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the files you want to use , and then these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition you will find some also in the context menu of the thumb@@ nail .
short commands for tasks performed by modules can set in the menu under Settings short commands .
for more information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules you can get over the K@@ IP@@ I project under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the di@@ asch@@ au should be easy to understand . the upper an@@ gler adjustable the time between the pictures , usually are 4 @-@ 5 seconds well . the other ou@@ ting fields turn on the metadata one or , which are displayed at the bottom of the images during the ad .
the camera features show on the left side a list of all currently supported cameras . on the right side there is a button Automatic detection , which is connected to the computer , make sure the camera is properly connected , switched on and in image mode mode . underneath are the port settings . currently , here are serial , US@@ B@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage .
at the bottom end you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wi@@ re@@ - ( IEE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) -@@ mass storage camera . this field is only active if you have selected a US@@ B@@ - or Fire@@ Wire camera camera from the camera bar . you need to specify the path , / m@@ us@@ / camera or / m@@ us@@ / , specify on which you attach your camera settings .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ tization ; you need to connect the camera to your computer , connect it to the ad mode .
try out whether &amp; checking ; the camera automatically recognis@@ es ; if not , you can set cam@@ amo@@ del and Port manually . after you have set your camera , your camera appears in the menu camera .
you can select any name for your camera . this is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window . if you own more than one camera , you can insert it all here .
with the option of confirmation dialog for the reloc@@ ating &gt; pictures in the trash bin you can view the talk of &amp; digi@@ tization ; in the del@@ eting a photos in an album . in the sections Del@@ ete of a photo and del@@ eting an album you will find further details .
editorial changes through the right side bar can still be applied by &amp; checking ; if you use the option to use changes in the right side@@ bar without revers@@ ing . otherwise , you need to use the changes with the button changes .
you can also tie the welcome of the welcome shield of &amp; digi@@ tization ; in the circumstances , it speeds up under circumstances the starting @-@ process of &amp; digi@@ tization .
the setup Bei@@ m start looking for new photos and check out ; the base folders after new or deleted albums / photos . this extends the start time from &amp; checking ; if something was deleted from the base folder , asks &amp; checking ; you if it should delete it from the database .
different color schem@@ as can be used in &amp; checking ; used to adjust the main window to your tastes . these settings can select you from settings design from the toolbar . a preview of available designs will be shown below :
these designs have been defined in simple text@@ files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ tization ; you will find more information about it in this tutorial .
&amp; checking ; contains a quick image processing with some basic tools . you can use this to view your photos and to correction and improve . the image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or through the context menu preview and selecting the preview menu .
the image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ tization ; so you are not part of your distribution . for more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules you will find in the section image processing .
a status line at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ ename , current fil@@ ename , enlar@@ ging factor and the current image size indicates .
a menu bar at the top of the edge , including the toolbar for quick access to the most common functions .
the editing functions of the image processing change your photos . none of the functions will change the original photo before saving file saved or the button save from the toolbar . note that you don &apos;t recover the original photo once you have saved the photo .
so you should make a copy of your image before you change it . this allows you to save it with file saved .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by converting from the menu file re @-@ establish or the button Re@@ construction of the image editing Rest@@ ore in the toolbar . you will lose any change you have done on the photo since the last save .
almost any action of the image processing can be und@@ one or recovered . the last action you can und@@ one by selecting any back @-@ up or recovered by selecting editing from the menu .
if you are often using this , you should make yourself the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ trl ; -@@ Z for back@@ track and C@@ trl ; -@@ Re@@ sch@@ alt @-@ Z to restore .
if you choose the &amp; L@@ MB to press a moment longer , you get a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions are also und@@ one or restored .
once you have started the image processing , you can use the photos in the same album or the same key@@ word by using navigation buttons in the toolbar . if you have any changes in the menu file , you will be asked if you want to save them .
you can use in the photo and out zo@@ oming in which you can use C@@ trl ; mouse wheel or the symbols in the toolbar or entries in the menu menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the toolbar : enlarge factor automatically
view full screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode . if you do not want this to use the toolbar button . if you do not want this , you can change it in the dialog dialog by &amp; Check ; you can view it from the board dialog . you can view this section on the setup of the image processing .
if you want to print the current image , you can print in the File menu and get the standard &amp; KDE ; print dialog . you can customize the settings before you print your photo .
from the main menu you can print individual images or whole sets . whole images pages can be printed out of your choice . you just need to select the images with the standard methods and select from the menu album Ex@@ por@@ ting printer wizard . if you follow the wizard , you just need to make your choice .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; main window has a side bar on the right edge , which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same side bar is available without the navigation column , also available in the image editing . it is displayed when one of the five riders will be clicked on :
multiple click on the same rider can be appearing in the side@@ bar or disappear again in the edge .
in the let@@ tering view , you can insert notes with unlimited size or insert it . the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed to be used in the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields , so that you can use other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are trun@@ cated after 2000 signs and special characters will be re@@ formed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling field in other applications , you should consider these restrictions .
after you have commented on using either the button or simply switch to the next picture , the cap@@ tions are then saved .
next to the use button there is a button More . with this you can read further metadata from selected file or database . however , you can also write the metadata in the files . however , this will always be done if you have chosen a metadata setting , which is always written into the pictures .
the assessment section shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting joints . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut Str@@ g + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images at the same time , select it and use the context menu .
the assessment is written into the IP@@ TC field ur@@ gency . co@@ ding follows the scheme in the following table :
the key@@ word view shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the keywords @-@ tree and a selection box with the previously mentioned in this &amp; digi@@ ous ; -@@ session of the keywords .
the key@@ word tree is dynamically adapted to the word processor . you can quickly restrict the number of options in search of a key@@ word . this ability is especially useful when you have a lot of keywords .
the input field at the bottom is another relief in entering keywords when entering a picture series . if you typ@@ ed different keywords , these are stored for quick access .
keywords can also be set by mark@@ ers of the corresponding approaches areas in the tree . all the keywords of an image are stored into the IP@@ TC field Key@@ words .
if multiple images are selected in the main view and select a key@@ word in the key@@ word , this will only be applied to the highlighted image and not to the entire selection , If you want to select a selection with a key@@ word , please read the section heading .
the side@@ bar stit@@ ching filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side@@ bar is used with their album , - data , keywords and search options . if in addition one or more sli@@ der filter is used from the right side , only the intersection of these two displayed are displayed . all er@@ ted keywords are available .
you can also drag and drop keywords . suppose you have selected multiple images in the main screen to draw you with keywords . if the key@@ word already exists , you can simply drag it out of the right side@@ bar and place on the selection . subsequently , a dialog you ask if you want to set the key@@ word .
in the top example , the main window shows the images on a calendar day . the key@@ word filter stands on no keywords what the amount has been reduced to three pictures . they were drawn with Str@@ g + a , and afterwards a key@@ word was drawn up from the right key@@ word on the selection and there . a dialog asks if this key@@ word should be set .
this search for changes will be held at any start of the program . it can also be switched off by settings Miscellaneous .
if you have a rule with and created and discover that it should be one or be , you can easily change this with a double clicking on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry in which you were looking for in the database . this can be an album , name , key@@ word , image , key@@ word , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or a string that is already set in the database .
for example , you can set a wide search of all the elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group options , you just need the cross box at the end of the rule and then use the button group@@ ing . the options look as follows :
why have Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Flickr were not listed there ? the free space is there on 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution .
this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I was mainly interested in &amp; digi@@ ous ; s made concrete implementation .
the reason why you are using a colored workflow , the colors available from your camera or scanner come a predictable variation from the actually photographed or sc@@ anned colors . with a colored workflow , you can reach that the colors on your monitor those of your camera or scanner , and that the colors you print or on the Web release those from your digital dark@@ room .
if the theme is on colour management , everyone wants to know which buttons he wants to press for the results that he wants . unfortunately , the meaning of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient information about color management . the purpose of this tutorial is to provide you with detailed information about color management . in addition , you will make links with deeper information to make your own informative decisions to make you get the desired result .
if your image workflow meets all six below criteria , you must not worry about color management .
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ R@@ GB foam . ( further information can be found below )
your only other images can be sent by e @-@ mail or the web where s@@ R@@ GB of de @-@ facto standard is .
so when S@@ R@@ GB does so well work and life for all so easy , why should one use another color tree and therefore have to worry about color bl@@ acks ?
a visual example of the Lim@@ itation of s@@ R@@ GB compared to the colours we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional reproduction of all colors that we can see , the hu@@ ber @-@ shaped region , and the colours in the s@@ R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ R@@ GB with some bigger color @-@ spaces , please visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms excell@@ ente page and then click info and then on Information About R@@ GB Working Sp@@ aces .
must I calibr@@ ate my monitor when I decided to work only at the R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum ?
yes ! whether you work in the s@@ R@@ GB color tree or not , you need to work your monitor k@@ alli@@ sts , because s@@ R@@ GB are doing that your ; on@@ itor works on s@@ R@@ GB , then you need to either use your monitor on the s@@ R@@ GB standard , a suitable monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions which can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before you attempt further manual processing .
the functions norm@@ alize , the same , automatic devi@@ ation and contrast extend from the menu running Automatic Automatic correction automatically try out of your colors the best . you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method will scale the luminous flu@@ x over the entire image , so that the dark@@ est point black and the brigh@@ test point is as bright as possible without its colour sh@@ aded . this function is often a magic correction for pictures that are dark or washed out .
the same : this method is adjusted the illumin@@ ance of the colors of the selected image , so that the H@@ ist@@ o@@ gram of the intensity is as flat as possible . sometimes , the same very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces only rub@@ b@@ ish . it is a very powerful surgery which will either cause miracles in a picture or destroyed it .
automatic : this method maxim@@ izes the color range in the red , green and blue @-@ channel . they determine the dark and bright border @-@ tones and adjusted the rot@@ or , green and blu@@ e@@ channels to the complete H@@ ist@@ o@@ grams .
contrast : this method improves the contrast and the lumin@@ ance of the R@@ GB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values in the greatest possible area and a new ji@@ ring of all values in @-@ between . this is only visible when used pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white @-@ off of &amp; D came ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white @-@ comparison of a photo .
the white @-@ equal correction is slightly limited because of a color tree with 8 @-@ bit per colour . if you can do too far from the original picture , in case you can perform the white @-@ off in the raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , so your ways to correction is better off .
this tool is based on a white in@@ fusion of the copyright of Pa@@ wel T. Jo@@ ch@@ y@@ m protected . they start it via the menu @-@ bearing colours white @-@ comparison of image processing .
the window ster can be adjusted in size . on the left side are both the original image and the preview of the target image . the preview will be dynamically adapted to the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original white comparison , it &apos;s enough to click on the sub@@ window .
the preview of the destination photos has a red marker . the L@@ umin@@ ance of the pixel below this marker is displayed as vertical line in H@@ ist@@ o@@ gram .
to the right above , a H@@ ist@@ o@@ gram is displayed that dynamically changes as soon as you change a parameter . this h@@ ist@@ o@@ gram is very helpful there , even in well illuminated pictures , most pixels very small L@@ umin@@ ator values . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is indicated . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ator .
the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and gam@@ ma . the shadow adjustment lets you improve the sh@@ ading details of your photos or also down di@@ mming .
An@@ stat uses the above controls to play , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press on this button and afterwards somewhere on the image preview to use the selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white @-@ like . in this way the temperature and green values are automatically set .
in addition , you can set the white comparison with the list of preferences . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposure Indi@@ c@@ ator increases the colors when more than a colour channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed .. You will display the combined result in the white comparison . this is displayed in the Preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the buttons Save as and store make exactly this . any setting of the whit@@ eboard you have set you can save it into a text file and load later .
the button pres@@ ets set all the filter values back to their default values and the corresponding neutral white @-@ like . please note that neutral settings can be rendered to a different photo than your original . if you save them , your original image will be changed .
you can adjust the co@@ di@@ li@@ fe per colour channel of the working image . 8 @-@ bit co@@ ding is the far @-@ common JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit co@@ ding is better suited for high @-@ quality images . this co@@ ding is also required for high @-@ quality images . this co@@ ding requires even more disk space , data period and stands on@@ screen for formats PNG , P@@ N@@ M , TIFF , and D@@ NG .
this tool opens the same dialog as the processing of raw materials . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color @-@ tone can be carried out by the sub@@ window for the brightness . a detailed instructions for the use of color profiles can be drawn to the chapter of color management .
another important tool is available in the menu using colors of sound correct . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously and allows you to use them for multiple photos . this is helpful if your camera or your scanner always make the same mistake and you therefore always need the same correction . in the manual for the recording correction , you will find further information .
a very powerful opportunity to correct exposure problems is the tool for Gra@@ dation that you can find under colors Gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; tool color effects puts you four color effects , a solar system effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a cant@@ onal filter .
in times of chemical processing was solar , also called Sab@@ ati@@ ans , an effect that was created when one had partly developed printing a short flash light and then inver@@ ted the development of the image . this had the effect that the ligh@@ ten areas dar@@ ker and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second lighting . the result was a partial neg@@ atively of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine .
the intensity controls the solar arization . at about 50 % intensity the picture shows what chem@@ ically possible . another increase is finally a neg@@ ativity that is not to generate a neg@@ ativity .
this is an example of solar effects . the original image is ( 1 ) and it worked on ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vivi@@ d @-@ Filter sim@@ ulates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from a s@@ ati@@ ation by doing that he has a stronger contra@@ sting effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it easy to em@@ bell@@ ish many photos .
Vel@@ via is the market name for one on day@@ light optim@@ izes color film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ b . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colors with day@@ light and high contrasts . the characteristics make him the film of choice for natural photography . Vel@@ vi@@ as strongly saturated colors are also a few photographs , especially those of the little landscapes ev@@ enly , too much .
the ne@@ on@@ filter sim@@ ulates Ne@@ on@@ light on the contrasts . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the shooting repeti@@ tions the strength of ne@@ on@@ lich@@ ts . in large images the filter can load the whole CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is therefore not uncommon to correct the color @-@ contra@@ sting of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . all your adjusting points can be previ@@ ew@@ ed in the preview . once you are satisfied with the result you are using the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
if you can make a photo with bad light conditions , you can get the reverse problem rather than to reduce it . even in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is able to reduce the tool instead of raising it . all changes you can perform in the preview . if Him like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool Gra@@ dation and the simple lights / contrast / Gamma is the tool key to improve the exposure . even if the dialog is very complicated for the use of this tool , you need only the range of shooting . concrete the three sliding below the ho@@ ist@@ gram@@ ms .
the window contains a graphs of intensity values , a h@@ ist@@ o@@ gram , the active channel or the selected area . under the graphs are three sli@@ ders into it and can be moved to change the intensity values of the picture . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to operate the operation is to move the regul@@ ator and pay attention to it as the image changes .
on the right hand , the original and the preview of the picture can be viewed . the preview is dynamically updated using the settings of the image . on the left , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : using this box can be adjusted , whether the H@@ ist@@ o@@ gram is shown with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y @-@ axis . for pictures of a constant paint , linear H@@ ist@@ o@@ gram is dominated by a single pillar . in this case , the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic arrangement is useful .
three regul@@ ator : the top one for the dark tones , the mean for the light tones and the lowest for the middle tones , often Gam@@ ma@@ ize .
the three shades can be used in the preview of original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shadow , middle and light tones automatically . in addition , there is a button for a fully automatic setting .
output values : the output values permit the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two regul@@ ators that can be used to change the output values interactive as in the input values . the compression of output values can be used e.g. to create a hidden image as background while something else is seen in the foreground .
automatically : with this button the image values automatically set in dependence on the intensity of the image .
save as and store : with these buttons , the set values can be saved in the fil@@ esystem and re@@ charged later , the Gimp format is used .
when you use this mode and the three color p@@ all@@ ets , the input values will automatically be used for all shadows , resources and solar notes . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the H@@ ist@@ o@@ gram for rot@@ or , green , blue and the lum@@ bar channels .
the option over@@ exposure indicator controlled all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixel and indicate the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator which means you get the effect only displayed in the Preview and there is no effect at the final result .
below you can see an example of the input values applied to red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and Alpha Channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture with ( 2 ) .
on the left @-@ hand side , half of the original is displayed and the target image is displayed dynamically depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available :
Modi@@ fy Channel : this selection box allows the channel to be modified by the module :
in addition to this box you are two symbols to switch between a linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for pictures that were recorded with a digital camera , linear mode are most sensu@@ ous mode . for pictures with large areas of a constant color generates linear mode creates a wide bar . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode continues .
if you move e.g. a cou@@ vent@@ eil to the right , for example the light sounds , then you can see that these bright tones with dar@@ ker output records and that the associated image pixels are dar@@ ker .
on the preview of original photos is a red marker . if you want to change this marker on the area you want to change , a suitable line appears on the curve that represents the original value . create a point on this line and move it up and off until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save as well as loading : with these buttons , you can make exactly this . each curve that you can have created can be saved in the fil@@ esystem and later loaded . the file format for this is the Gimp curve format .
if you want to create this method and the three color p@@ all@@ ets buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of the shadow , middle and sun@@ shades . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and L@@ umin@@ anz@@ ola curve .
the option over@@ exposure indicator controlled all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixel . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixel , you get the combined result shown . here , it is an indicator which means you get the effect only displayed in the Preview and there is no effect at the final result .
below you can see a black and white photo which has been fixed in the L@@ umin@@ anz@@ canal . shadow and Sundays was applied with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel bl@@ ender of the &amp; digi@@ tization ; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color gra@@ dations of the photos .
the channel mix@@ er is another advanced tool to mix the shades of images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel bl@@ ender of the image processing .
using the can@@ al@@ timeter , you can select the color for the H@@ ist@@ o@@ gram : this gives you a first hint about you to fix the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash . the left area of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed as compared to your own rider .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position this in the picture , a vertical line appears in the h@@ ist@@ o@@ gram to show you the corresponding colors .
the controls for the module are right down : controls for red , green and construction allow you to manage these channels . if you can also edit the appropriate color components , the channel mix@@ er then DAS tool to generate great black and white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ och@@ rom , the reduction of a color comes to a visible ru@@ stling that comes from far@@ thing . Far@@ si consists of small rob@@ bed parts which does not occur at the same place in colour canal and their smoking patterns in each channel looks different . if that is the case , you can improve your mono@@ chrome conversion in which you want to reduce the color first .
saving as well as store buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any bl@@ ender setting can be saved for later and then load . the file format is the Gimp channel mix@@ er format .
the option over@@ exposure indicator controlled all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixel and indicate the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator which means you get the effect only displayed in the Preview and there is no effect at the final result .
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been re@@ bound@@ ed . the original image is activated under ( 1 ) and the original picture below ( 2 ) to see .
black / White photography was always fascinating because of your abstr@@ action . with the development of digital photography is black / white a work@@ step , because color images can be easily converted to the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles .

green belt : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good , with all the scen@@ eries and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky . so similar to the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter .
Oran@@ fil@@ ter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a orange filters . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and a@@ erial photos . so similar to the 00@@ 2 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) orange filmed .
red filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates a dramatic natural effect and can sim@@ ulate lun@@ ar @-@ effects to day time . so similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Rot@@ filter .
yel@@ lowing : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural colour correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) gel filter .
Sep@@ i@@ aton : creates warm bright and medium tones , while he adds a bit col@@ dness in the sh@@ att@@ un@@ es . this is very similar to the process of the stay of a pressure and the re@@ development in a Sep@@ i@@ at@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and thus similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the &amp; digi@@ tization ; tool texture allows you to apply decorative textures to a picture .
by adding a texture about your image , whether it is a color picture or not , you can look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop kind of portrait from enlarged points or as a wall @-@ screen on a wall . the menu entry image applying the image editing can be used for it .
relief : move this parameter to the right increases the semb@@ lance of the depth and three @-@ dimension@@ ality of texture on the picture .
a paper text effect has been applied in the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) to see . the parameter relief has been set to 200 .
with the bed checking ; tool frame can add a decorative frame to add an image .
keeping the eye of an eye on the limits of a photo is not an easy task . a possibility to keep his attention is to make the picture a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the stre@@ et@@ ching eye . this is a psychological barrier to the next eye . under picture frames the module can be started from the image processing .
type : with this parameter you set the desired size type for your image . continuous the image with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce cuts it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white pictures ) , dra@@ ined it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame of the ideal for a button @-@ effect and decor@@ atively adds a decorative frame with patterns .
width : returns the width of the frame in percent . the value range for width is from 1 % to 50 % limited .
this is larger than the original , but the same aspect ratio is larger than the original aspect ratio . this is important for printing of images , especially if you have used the tool After aspect ratio .
with this practical tool , you can easily insert a form@@ atted text into a picture at any point . this also goes to several places when you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with your mouse . use text size , orientation , color out of the color tree and the character set with its features like you need it . the larger the image , the larger must be the character set . at the end , simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background .
each setting that you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press on the button &apos; OK &apos; . after the picture is saved , the text is part of the picture . it can no longer be changed .
you can use the template to apply a template via a picture .
the menu image template uses in the image processing can be used to lay sc@@ outs over a picture .
for the sten@@ cil there are no restrictions on size and orientation . however , if you want to use the PNG file format and if you want to add with maximum compression ( 9 ) to the reduction of file size of the template , just send an e @-@ mail in English to the &amp; digi@@ tization ; mail@@ ing@@ list Buil@@ der @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your template folder with the button base folder . select the folder in which you have copied the template files . these settings will be re@@ marked for the next start .
after the root folder was set for the template , a building @-@ view , which reflects the folder structure of the template &apos;s folder . selecting a folder updates the pre @-@ display of the templates automatically .
below the preview are three buttons with which you can change the enlar@@ ging factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button is increasing the underlying picture . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check with the left mouse button .
res@@ ized : this button res@@ ized the underlying picture . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you need to make the picture accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move this button to move the image below the template . take the picture and place it at the desired position .
if you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then be adapted automatically .
&amp; D came ; presents three different tools to the field of field . each of you has advantages in other areas .
shar@@ pen is a traditional tool to shar@@ pen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but , especially in dark areas , gran@@ ular images .
Un@@ shar@@ p mask works on the contrast of the edges to look around an image sharp@@ ens . you can use it rather psych@@ ic Dun@@ st and it makes it a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted by W@@ inst@@ on Chang .
re@@ focused is possibly the best of the three , since it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters to adapt .
photos without focus as well as most digi@@ tised pictures require a correction of depth . elements that are smaller than the resolution are taken into a common colour . the same phenomenon can be observed if color points are printed on paper . S@@ LR cameras normally need more detri@@ mental to shar@@ pen@@ ing as normal cameras for private users .
with JPEG images often a camera has been applied internal shar@@ pen@@ ing . pictures in the raw format on the other hand must always be curved during the processing .
some sc@@ anners have a sharp@@ ness filter already during the reading of the picture . if you disable this , you get in control of your image .
in some situations , you can get usable results by raising a photo with the field of field advertising . you can call with the menu entry of cor@@ rigi@@ dity .
but they should not handle caution because the results are not very natural : the sharp@@ ness increases the edge of the edges , but also intensi@@ fies the noise . in general , the usable technique to shar@@ pen the tool re@@ focus . they reach it via the menu entry to focus on re@@ focused . below Re@@ focused , you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques to shar@@ pen .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too casual . the solution to draw the image a little soft is much easier than it to shar@@ pen . use the tool to soft@@ ness with the menu entry cor@@ rigi@@ dity and experiment something with settings . the default on the right of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter is bl@@ ur@@ red , a very good tool to remove v@@ eils of your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and the thumb@@ nail can help you edit the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often generate good results and should be tried first . an increase of radius or amount reinforce the effect . if you create the in@@ sharp@@ ness mask will make noise and the impression of gr@@ ats in the proximity of sharp edges .
the radius represents one like many pixels on each side of a edges by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow bigger radi@@ i . they should therefore shar@@ pen images best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the caught image that is added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the swelling value is a fraction of the maximum R@@ GB value and the applicable difference . you can thus define a minimum difference for a edges of the filter . in this way , areas will be avoided with a soft change between killing and therefore beauty errors in faces , cel@@ esti@@ al and water @-@ surfaces .
this is an example of the bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the edited picture the ( 2 ) . bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king was used with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a spon@@ ge = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; tool re@@ focused on a picture by improving the edge . it used to be protected by protected unfolding filter by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries to make a picture &amp; quot ; re@@ focused quot ; in which it is a better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it is using a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ tering . the traditional technique on the shar@@ pen@@ ing of images is the use of an in@@ sharp@@ ness mask . you can start it from the menu by calling colors Re@@ focused in the editing process .
in practice the circular fly has much better than the gau@@ ge &apos;s f@@ ission . the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche F@@ altung has a very long tail , which leads far from the original pixel , which depends far from the original pixel . the FI@@ R Wiener In@@ verse of the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ schen F@@ altung is influenced in most cases even very strongly influenced by the distant pixel . the causes unwanted results .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of circular folding . it is the most important parameter for the use of this module . for most images the default value should result 1 good results . you can put a higher value when your image is very bl@@ ur@@ red , but then on hal@@ o .
cor@@ relation : an increase in cor@@ relation can help to reduce art@@ e@@ facts . the cor@@ relation can be chosen from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and the values close 1 , &amp; eg ; 0,@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for cor@@ relation reduces the shar@@ pen@@ ing effect of the module .
Rau@@ sch@@ filter : an increase in the spac@@ ing filter can help you to reduce arti@@ facts . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 the image quality is very bad . a high value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value will continue the picture even further .
gau@@ ge &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the gau@@ ge &apos;s edge . use this parameter when your in@@ sharp@@ ness is caused . in most cases , you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying art@@ e@@ facts . if you use a value un@@ equal zero , you might need to increase the cor@@ relation and / or the noise filter .
matrix size : this value determines the size of the transform@@ ation@@ matrix . an increase in the matrix size can create good results , especially if you select large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the gau@@ ge &apos;s sharp@@ ness . however , note that the module will be very slow if you choose large values for this parameter . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
saving as well as store buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any reproduction parameter which you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
try to perform all the cuts , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the picture before using the module .
otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that a lot of operations changes that are not immediately visible , which left un@@ pleasant art@@ e@@ facts .
if you read images and compressed , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should use the module on the un@@ compressed image .
generally , bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king produced better results as sharp@@ ness . this could be caused by bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king a larger neighbourhood used as sharp@@ ness .
theoretically , bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king must always produce arti@@ facts . even under optimal conditions it can never show the effect of the sharp@@ ness . for the Wiener filter you can show that it is the optimal Lin@@ e@@ are filter at least as good as the in@@ sharp@@ ness mask . the FI@@ R Wiener Filter is often better in editing of small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters , on a small un@@ focused image , see :
the original un@@ sharp colour image has to be corrected . this image has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for auto @-@ focus lens .
for more information on the methods of the approach in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address .
the regul@@ ator Gl@@ ät@@ te sets the in@@ sharp@@ ness of the area that was dark@@ ened , in order to generate a more natural p@@ up@@ ille .
the shade offers a adapted color for the P@@ up@@ ille . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can adjust it here .
the tool imaging is one of the most developed tool to remove not desired art@@ e@@ facts with an unprecedented speed .
the algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ pact Project .
this tool contains various pres@@ ets as starter points to simplify the restoration . the available preferences are indicated below :
if you want to adjust the filtering settings fine , you can use the rider gl@@ acial and advanced settings .
detail post@@ ure p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a small value leads to a ev@@ enly smo@@ o@@ thing about the image . a value of 0.@@ 9 should obtain details so that no shar@@ pen@@ alties is necessary to obtain . please note that the detailed information is always subordin@@ ated to the right @-@ dependence .
breath @-@ dependent Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es in all directions , while a value is close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a film gran@@ ular or CCD Rau@@ schen will produce a high value in wave @-@ like pattern . JPEG arti@@ facts are best placed at a value close to 1 .
smooth &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this puts the maximum smo@@ o@@ thing factor above all@@ es. then defines the relative smo@@ o@@ thing . set this value therefore suitable to the degree of smoking in your picture .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is pressed , as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture . even if you want to produce a &apos; van Gogh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect it must be higher than 3 .
repeti@@ tions : returns on how often the algorithm is passed . normally , here is 1 or 2 .
angle @-@ wide da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ en Alpha . if alpha is small chosen , there should be also small to create a long run time . so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to suit your needs .
integral step@@ per &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral step@@ per in pixels . you should set the value of smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smo@@ o@@ thing and never bigger than 2 .
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation use : the enhanced quality that you get through choice of this option is only low . he doubles but the term . we therefore recommend it to let him go .
the buttons save as well as loading make exactly this . any setting of image errors can correct this into a text file and be loaded later .
image errors correct compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can take very long and take a high CPU load after it . you can therefore break the calculation with the button down at any time .
below you can see how picture errors can be corrected with Small art@@ e@@ facts . the module is made in a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you see , there is a peculi@@ ar black art@@ e@@ act in the foreground that caused by a bad film storage during the journey is caused ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ tization : noise reduction is a very powerful tool to decrease images . it uses a copyrighted algorithm of Peter H@@ eck@@ ert .
this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters to remove stain@@ s and other arti@@ facts that come from dust or hair on the lens , too . it can also be used to remove sensor ru@@ ffles from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ ers ; effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines .
if you need further information on Sensor cameras from digital cameras , you can read this in English in this tutorial .
the scre@@ enshot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gran@@ ular noise which can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you will only need the sub@@ window details and the sub@@ window advanced settings can remain with the default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time the filters are needed per pixel and can get the image into it . the image specified by the radius is moving over the picture and the color in it gets smooth@@ ed and therefore minor bugs .
sharp@@ ness : controls the edge @-@ level . this value sets the pix@@ el@@ ab@@ duc@@ ted the filter to be as@@ cer@@ tained . if it is lifted up the edges of the filter . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter picture details can no longer receive and noise or black@@ smith occurs again .
edges : controls the tigh@@ tening accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong can not occur the entire noise or smo@@ kes you can occur . put it on a value close to the max@@ im if you want to remove a f@@ aint smoking or JPEG @-@ art@@ e@@ facts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance of the image . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to change in order to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smo@@ o@@ thing process which is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the toler@@ ant toler@@ ance of the picture . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to change in order to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smo@@ o@@ thing process which is controlled by the details settings .
gam@@ ma : controls the gam@@ mat@@ ol@@ er@@ ance of the picture . this value can be used to increase the tolerance @-@ values of the dar@@ ker areas , which typically are more rough to increase . it also cuts the shadow areas .
vap@@ our : controls the adjusting filter radius on variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is lifted up , the edges may appear . if it is too high can be a mi@@ er , smoking and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter appear to the edges . he can remove h@@ amm@@ ers and is the recommended method for it .
store under and store : these buttons are used exactly for this . all parameters for the noise reduction you have set can be stored in the fil@@ esystem and later loaded .
this is an example of how smoking reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was applied with the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too chil@@ ly for your purpose . the solution to draw the image a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use the tool to soft@@ ness with the menu entry cor@@ rigi@@ dity and experiment with the smo@@ o@@ thing . the passing on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photographs of photographs .
this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted art@@ e@@ facts about your images . he is very well adapted to remove gau@@ ge &apos;s colored , scrat@@ ches , compres@@ sing , compres@@ sing , compres@@ sing , compres@@ sing , compres@@ sing , compres@@ sing , compres@@ sing , compos@@ ites , and thereby maintains the content as well as the human eye .
the same algorithm can be used for color and text composition . the text composition is carried out with another tool , the image inf@@ alli@@ c , carried out . the algorithm for restoration was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ oses and is part of the C@@ Im@@ pact Project .
JPEG arti@@ facts reduce : the compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away from it . as a los@@ sy Com@@ pressed Com@@ pressed ; - small standards that are shown in un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these issues .
the buttons Save as and store make exactly this . any setting of photo restoration can therefore be saved into a text file and later re@@ charged .
photo @-@ restoration is compar@@ atively very fast during work . however , it can take very long and take a high CPU load after it . you can therefore break the calculation with the button at any time .
below you can reduce as a photo with the like @-@ shaped smoke .. The module is applied to a black and white photo that has been recorded with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the in@@ famous film gran@@ ules on the faces . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected under ( 2 ) to see .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time , textures was reduced to an old color photo that has been read with a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ e@@ facts that were caused by the Sc@@ ann@@ er@@ lights and the photo paper . the original image is below ( 1 ) to see and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; tool hot@@ bed permits it hot@@ bed of photos that were done with a CCD camera , eight were to remove . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project , protected by Martin Dick@@ ens .
bright , t@@ ote or hot pixels are particularly high @-@ quality raw mode photos a problem because many cameras with JPEG compression over a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixel quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright pix@@ el@@ quot ; in a photo with a dark picture method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file in the wizard with the button &apos; button . the tool will detect automatic and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the preview show .
if you have an old digital camera , it is important that you will contact the dark picture directly in connection to discover new hot or bright pixels through CCD defects .
first as described in the previous section , you should download the appropriate dark image to the corrected picture . a automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels . note that the wizard shows the last blue picture and this automatically invites you to the next session .
the image area and the preview will help you to correct the result within the picture . the default shows the output of the filter with the current settings . poor pixels are raised in all occur@@ ren@@ ditions .
select an area around the def@@ ective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . select afterwards the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ed these pixel errors . these are the available filters :
Dur@@ ation : it is determined an average of the neighboring block . the resulting color will be assigned to all the def@@ ective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this is done separately for horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a gap of 1 of pixel block , are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of lin@@ ear@@ en curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ed the def@@ ective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard fil@@ ter@@ method . all pixels with a gap of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which then is used to inter@@ pol@@ ed the pixels in the block .
Cub@@ an : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ Cub@@ an surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of Cub@@ an curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which then is used to inter@@ pol@@ ed the def@@ ective pixels in the block .
below you can see the hot@@ bed correction on a color foto , from a faul@@ ty digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image was increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected picture is below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ tization : vig@@ net@@ ti@@ fying correction is a tool to correct the Vig@@ r@@ ting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , an image .
vast@@ ly objects , especially those in the middle and large photo format , can often illumin@@ ate the entire sensor range . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ scape quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they can reduce the corners and edges of the image , by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there . tele@@ objects show under circumstances also this behavior .
but he also has disadvantages . many center @-@ filters require a factor 1.5 or 2 with aper@@ ture filter , which is impossible to keep the camera with hand . vast@@ ly objects should also use with center filters , an opening of f / 16 or small , as otherwise un@@ bl@@ ur effects arise by movement .
with the great exposure areas of today &apos;s film and the shades of digital cameras and film scanner , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of a c@@ enter@@ filter by using an equi@@ val@@ ent transformation of a raw filter , which is applied without this filter . the tool Vig@@ net filter is applied to a picture . the algorithm is copyrighted by John Walker .
with three controllers , you can control the vig@@ net@@ ti@@ fying filter and with three more the exposure of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light gravity at the point of the biggest density the filter . the standard density is 2,@@ 0 , resulting from an optical filter with a aper@@ ture angle of 1 , or random@@ ly a light intensity of 2 , ent@@ sp@@ rang , reduce it to compens@@ ate for a small degree .
Leu@@ ch@@ ool , contrast and gam@@ ma settings : the editing of an image with the Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ fying correction is reduced the lumin@@ osity of the pixels . you need to re@@ adjust the exposure of the target image using these options . the regul@@ ator will only provide positive values because you only need to increase the settings .
if you want a fine re@@ plen@@ um of the exposure of the target image , so let the values for illumin@@ ance / contrast / gam@@ ma with zero and use the Gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ tization ; image processing from the menu color Gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ fying correction to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the corrected picture . a lumin@@ ance and contra@@ sting correction was also carried out in the image with this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; Lin@@ sen@@ ver@@ distor@@ tion is a tool to correct the impact of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copyrighted algorithm by David Ho@@ d@@ son .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric distor@@ tions . colored distor@@ tions cannot be corrected with this tool .
the co@@ efficient of the second gradient treats the general geomet@@ ric distor@@ tion of the lens , and can correct the conc@@ ave or con@@ ical shape of the image .
the co@@ efficient of the third gradient has a similar circuit effect , fla@@ p but at the edges . this correction is not used in the tool .
the co@@ efficient fourth gra@@ des corrected the distant corners to the second gra@@ ding . if you combine these two can be eliminated any geomet@@ ric distor@@ tion almost eliminated .
generally : this value controls the strength of the distor@@ tion of the second gra@@ ding . with negative values , tons can be corrected , and positive values can be distor@@ ted .
corner : this value controls the strength of the distor@@ tion fourth gra@@ ding . this value affects the edges as in the middle of the picture . for most lenses the &apos; corners parameter has the inver@@ ted prec@@ ursor of the parameter .
zoom : this value sc@@ aled the image size and thus leads to a correction first gradient by . negative values enlarge as positive the image res@@ ized .
bright : this value adjust the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image into the corners , while positive values they increase .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog with a preview the distor@@ tion procedure . the values you use for your image are stored and used at the next start as standard values .
the tons or col@@ os@@ ci@@ zed correction should be performed prior to all tri@@ mmer - or size changes . the best way to cut this correction as all first . if you do a picture anew , and then perform a tons @-@ shaped correction , the effect is apparent from the fal@@ si@@ le .
to help you find the best correction , this tool provides a vertical and horizontal relief line . move it to an important place , such as the sea edge or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . afterwards , you can fix the lines / k@@ ci@@ pher distor@@ tion with the help of the lines .
if you have a cold @-@ shaped distor@@ tion , the resulting image is black corners . you can transform them into the menu using the cutting tool in the menu or remove it from the image processing or on the zoom regul@@ ator of this dialog .
for most pictures , the tons @-@ shaped correction is enough . the next logical step for some motives like e.g. recordings from the front , frame and painting , it &apos;s the perspective to correct the all angles in the image 90 degrees . note that if you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distor@@ tion of the perspective .
this is an example of the low @-@ shaped correction to a church in Norway . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to sim@@ ulate infrared film of the imp@@ lied belts , which is available under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) S@@ FX@@ 200 I@@ infrared film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity area of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left of the window you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rectangle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the picture .
below the preview you can sim@@ ulate two parameters set film gran@@ ularity and film sensitivity . the ISO regul@@ ator changes the amount of film gran@@ ularity and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in conversion . green meadows are white as snow !
as the filter color channels for re@@ producing infrared film mis@@ ses , especially the green canal makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white @-@ photos , as the color informations are missing .
this is an example of infrared film effects applied to a landscape photo taken from New Zealand . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the edited picture below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a kind of au@@ ra in the sh@@ red@@ dish .
the &amp; digi@@ tization : filter film @-@ drying is a simple to use tool to reproduce films of images on your images . this is known by classic high @-@ speed filter , such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X , known to increase the sensitivity of the movies , the manufacturers big sil@@ gran@@ ules of the photo em@@ ulsion .
the film @-@ gra@@ ff@@ ing effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . the treated picture gets a timeless atmosphere loos@@ ed from everyday life . if you want to use this special , gallery @-@ like , rocky sight especially in your mono@@ chrome photos , you need to use this filter .
with the regul@@ ator , the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ularity of the Kör@@ ner . the default value is , although often higher values are needed to apply to ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need even more gra@@ ins , you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of film gran@@ ular effects applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the working ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ tization : filter oil gem@@ äl@@ de creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ tization : filter oil gem@@ äl@@ de gives your digital images a nice appearance like an oil painting . natural images and styles are good for this effect .
there are two regul@@ ators to influence this effect . the top sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thicker brush are suitable for great pictures . gl@@ are controlled the smo@@ o@@ thing or , from the other side , the uniqueness .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the original is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixel large picture is 1 and smo@@ o@@ te 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; filter carbon drawing uses color and integ@@ ers to create a K@@ ohl@@ k . therefore the images whose gradient can change slowly are therefore not ideal for this effect . it &apos;s helpful if you would like to imagine what scene you would have chosen to sc@@ ure you . this would be good pictures to start with it .
there are two regul@@ ator with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper an@@ gler sel@@ ects the pin size and the lower shifted the contrast ( smo@@ o@@ thing ) .
this is an example of coher@@ ence filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be improved by adjustment of the intensity .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; filter engra@@ ver shapes your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was cr@@ acked in wax . it is used to include a copyrighted algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ tization : filter engra@@ ving is a fast tool to give your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . he works especially well with pictures with a simple structure where color is not the most important thing about the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ dar@@ ed landscape .
the depth allows the contrast of the filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default .
this is an example of the engra@@ ving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the edited picture ( 2 ) . the depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a artwork by means of distor@@ tion effects . it uses protected algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wav@@ el@@ ength 1 : shares the image in cells and let it look as if it is considered by means of gl@@ ass@@ esses .
shaft blocks 2 : analog to the shaft blocks 1 , the image is distor@@ ted here in a different version of gl@@ ass@@ ware .
some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel this effects at any time with the button .
with this filtering group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork using in@@ sharp@@ ness effects . it uses protected algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom in@@ sharp@@ ness : wi@@ pes the picture along static lines that go from a center . this sim@@ ulates the in@@ sharp@@ ness a zo@@ oming camera and produces a dynamic expression of the often seen in the sport photography .
radi@@ al in@@ sharp@@ ness : wi@@ t the picture by rotation of the pixels by a center . this sim@@ ulates the in@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing of a revol@@ ting camera .
removal of removal : wi@@ pes the image to create the effect of a not focused camera lens . the object seems to step back in the background .
restra@@ int : wi@@ ped out the picture by horizontal movements of the pixels . this sim@@ ulates the in@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing of a linear movable , z : B : from a car or train photograph@@ ing , camera .
sof@@ tening in@@ sharp@@ ness : wi@@ ped the image soft into the dark and strong in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dream@@ y and glorious soft focusing effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ am@@ or photos or to add a warm and subtle bulbs .
Sch@@ üt@@ tel@@ bl@@ ur@@ fe : wi@@ pes the picture with random shift of the pixels and sim@@ ulates the sharp@@ ness of an arbitrary camera .
intelligent sharp@@ ness : find the colour bas@@ ins in the picture and caught it without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : shares the photo in rectangular cells and then created it by filling with an average pixel value .
some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation anytime with the button .
the rain drops are a cute little tool to make rain drops in your picture . this makes it natural your images a good appearance . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copyrighted algorithm .
dri@@ p size allows it to change the size of the dri@@ p . since the dro@@ ple@@ t size does not grow automatically with the size of the image , it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images . quantity changes the number and density of drops . fishing changes the optical effect of drops in the image .
you can use the &amp; digi@@ tization ; image editing a area @-@ free from rain drops . use the selection tool to choose the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you start the filter rain drops the area will remain free of rain drops .
this is an example of rain drops . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the edited picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , so you can bring it through mirrors or turning into the correct orientation . the tools can be transformed in the menu transforming dirt or transform spi@@ der .
photo infl@@ atable is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimum loss of image quality .
a picture to res@@ ist is simple . the big question is how can you keep an image infl@@ atable and the details are sharp ? how can you find the missing information again or guess ? how can you find the missing information again or guess ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm that is used here , here is a good job . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . select to change the size in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is below .
the tool to adjust the size uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to enlarge the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool to infl@@ atable .
many image processing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. spl@@ ine Inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; checking ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo infl@@ ating was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ pact Project .
you must tell the tool as you want to change the size . these settings are available in the rider New size and are displayed below :
aspect ratio : when this setting is activated , when entering the new size the aspect ratio of the original image is maintained .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is pressed , as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture . even if you want to produce a &apos; van Gogh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect it must be higher than 3 .
the buttons Save as and store are used exactly for this . any inser@@ tion for photo can enlarge as text file and later re@@ charged .
photo infl@@ ating is very fast with what it does , but it can still take very long and take a high CPU load after getting off . you can cancel calculation with the button at any time .
you can see below an example of picture infl@@ ating by adding a small color picture to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard magnific@@ ation compared to the comparison .
cutting of a photo is not only a frequently performed surgery but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to put together a picture . the image editing allows you to simply drag the rectangle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and drag the rectangle , create . you will see this rectangle then while you move the mouse .
when you release the mouse button again , the area of photos will be cut off . this gives you a good overview how your photo would look after cutting . you can change the size of the rectangle by clicking on the corners of the rectangle . a new rectangle can create by simply drag it with the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cutting button , use the button The C@@ trl @-@ button of the image processing in the toolbar and the photo is designed ( C@@ trl ; + X ) . use the file saved or save file saved in the menu file to save the newly cro@@ pped picture .
in the preview area , you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in dialogue will remain .
in the tool After aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as high @-@ format or cross @-@ format . the high format is always assigned to the larger value of height and in cross @-@ format width .
the tool After aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . this means it is always the same , irrespective of whether you use centimeters , In@@ ch or any other physical size . you can e.g. see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog there are two buttons around the selection automatically horizontal or vertically .
below the dialog you can set up with the Max . ratio button to the area to access to the greatest possible , depending on the chosen relationship and orientation .
the tool After aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the orientation orientation ( horizontal or vertical ) . if you use the cutting tool the next time , these settings are displayed as standard values depending on the orientation . the modified picture dimensions are displayed in the EX@@ IF tables so that the EX@@ IF data are reflected in the EX@@ IF data and do not reflect the original image .
the settings of the re@@ plac@@ ements allow help to bl@@ ended up so that you can put your images better . these help are :
harmonic triangle : harmonious divi@@ ding are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . as the third @-@ hed@@ geho@@ gs , harmonic tri@@ angles are a possibility to split a rectangle in similar harmon@@ ical tri@@ angles on the diag@@ on@@ als .
golden center : the golden center is a division which extends to various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us pussy , or the fl@@ akes of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all possible things that we feel as beautiful .
the golden division is the ir@@ rational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was already used in the ancient Egyptians and Greeks who built your temples and pyr@@ ami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden division in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number is derived from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 8 , 8 , 34 , 34 &amp; etc ; from where each number is equal to 1 equal to the sum of their two previous numbers . the resulting sub@@ section is 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the golden center . a composition which this rule is followed as visually harmon@@ i@@ ously .
the golden center provides fluids lines . if you put an image together , these help will be raised below :
the Golden Spir@@ al spiral will bring you good results to your goal . compared to third @-@ re@@ gel , the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the picture . this type of composition leads the view of the be@@ holder along the line of spiral and creates on this type a symmet@@ rical visual flow .
another rule is the rectan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called Golden ortho@@ graphy . there should be something that the eye can be at the center of the composition . this may be a line or different objects . this something can just be there without the eye to guide it will fulfill its task .
the Gol@@ fe tri@@ angles also derive from the above @-@ colored golden spiral . their ver@@ tices are the middle @-@ points of the pages of the golden rectangle . note that in contrast to harmonious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not equal tri@@ angles . diag@@ onal to place these lines can place a static object dynamic .
when you use golden tri@@ angles to break up your frame create an effect of professional photographer dynamic Sym@@ met@@ ry . try to place your image asset on one of the cutting points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve differently .
the options horizont@@ ally mirror and vertical mirror can be used to mirror the harmonic part .
the button color allows you to set the color of the Help lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the auxiliary lines can be invisible . in this way you can customize the color of the lines of your current image .
the free rotation is a tool to rot@@ ate an image to any angle .
if you do a photo , then it happens easily that you &apos;re not exactly vertically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which the things have turned out an angle . you can repair this with the bed ; image editing and the tool free rotation . select to transform free rotation and adjust the target angle .
turning your image with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this sli@@ der are indicated in degrees . with the button pres@@ ets you can put the sli@@ der again to 0 degrees . a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture are shown on the right above .
for your help , the module turns free rotation a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse pointer in the image preview to position the two lines . after you fix it over an important point of the picture , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous section .
after you have shot a picture you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to fix this is to transform it the function transformation from the image processing .
an elegant way to cut the image is Autom@@ atically cutting . select one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smooth@@ es the picture a bit after rotation . however , note that the above warning .
all per@@ spec@@ tiv@@ ic transformations are carried out by a fixed point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares to the corners of your image . the preview will then automatically be re@@ charged . on the right of the dialog you will find some information which help you to change the perspective :
new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by transformation , in pixels .
new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by transformation , in pixels .
angle left : displays the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed territory .
angle on the top right : displays the current angle in degrees at the top right of the transformed territory .
angle on the left below : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed territory .
angle on the right below : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed territory .
according to the adaptation of the perspective the image becomes a little wast@@ ed . for a single adaptation this effect is small but two adjustments create a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you have adapted the perspective , you get unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to ber@@ some it is the image with transforming cutting from the image processing .
the estim@@ ation tool is used to move a part of the image in a direction and move the other part into the opposite . this is no spin , the image will be distor@@ ted . in other words , a rectangle is turned into a parall@@ elo@@ gram . you can start this module over transform sc@@ rolling .
push your image using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . you can push horizont@@ ally and vertically at the same time . if you push on preference , the angle on zero will be shown . a preview of the effect will display you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed on the right of the display area .
to your help , a vertical and horizontal line appears . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool to adjust your image .
after you have carried out the shots , the picture becomes a bit wis@@ ely . for a single sh@@ ing this effect is usually neglected , but two shots generated twice as much bl@@ ur@@ ing and therefore you should avoid this .
after closing , the image has un@@ beautiful tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate this is to cut the image with transforming cutting from the image processing .
&amp; checking ; needs a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . therefore , the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries comp@@ iling . in most distribu@@ tions you will be able to edit a large number of imaging rate with &amp; digi@@ tization .
because of this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on their system . however , you will always find JPEG and TIFF .
&amp; checking ; displays only files in formats which knows . this happens based on the file extension and a comparison of these with a pre @-@ defined list . if the extension has been listed in the list , the file will be displayed in the image editing . you can change this list of file extensions . in the section configuration you will find further information on this .
almost all digital cameras save photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras allow you to select even the format used . a more detailed description of this file formats you can find in Wikipedia . &amp; checking ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression to digital images . thereby , redund@@ ant information is reduced to store the image data on a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , smo@@ other results than JPEG in the same compression . the 200@@ 0s version can also be freely saved if this is specified in the settings .
if you want to know more about the raw material format , you can read in Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful tutorials in English . you can find raw material pictures in JPEG or TIFF with the raw materials from &amp; checking ; convert . in the section configuration you will find further information on how to use modules with &amp; checking ; .
&amp; checking ; supports the loading of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is in &amp; digi@@ tization . all support cameras can be seen below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats that came from &amp; checking ; supported :
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are often saved in A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format ; but it is not a film editor , and therefore has no built @-@ in possibilities to display or edit . when you click on a film file , the &amp; KDE ; settings for playback of films to start playing the program to play .

if you change the steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well when the initial contrast was already very good , then you can perform the first four adjusting pins with the module white .
many tools you need the pictures you need in &amp; checking ; contain your description below here .
all image processing tools such as sharp@@ ens , soft@@ ness , noise , smoke det@@ oxi@@ fication , re@@ focus , bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform dialog type that is applied the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current picture . below you can see &amp; quot ; texture rate quot ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter on the current image . links from it allow five buttons to change the comparative field of the thumb@@ nail . these modes are :
vertical split without duplic@@ ates . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected range .
horizont@@ ally share without duplic@@ ates . the upper area shows the original and the lower shows the filter applied to the area below the selected range .
vertical . the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
horizont@@ ally split . the top range shows the original and the lower to compare the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ mouse over &apos; -@@ style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in the display area and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can switch to display over@@ - and under@@ exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame to choose the preview . you can drop this frame with your mouse within the picture and drop it on the part of the picture , from which you want to preview the preview . the preview in the left part of dialogue will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons on your default values . all adjustment from the last use of the module are marked .
the side@@ bar properties displays the essential information about the selected image and is largely explained . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo properties : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos . these data are from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this rider provides an intuitive approach tool available based on the margin of mouse button or push it and move and move . move it while you click the left mouse button . press C@@ trl ; lin@@ ker Maus@@ kno@@ b to pull a square . all pictures within this coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . this will naturally pres@@ upp@@ oses the your pictures ge@@ o data .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for p@@ all@@ ets files . the application can be used for editing color pal@@ ettes and for selecting and naming of colors .
the p@@ all@@ ets @-@ files that are installed by &amp; KDE ; you can either apply to the whole system or just one user . in the latter case they are in your personal folder for &amp; KDE ; settings and hot user @-@ defined color and allow@@ ance used .
in the dialog box , you can select from a list of installed p@@ all@@ ets or browse the folders according to files .
the cursor is displayed in the p@@ allet screen as a line . it can be moved by clicked on the area next to a color .
it shows the colour beside it . the color is described below the p@@ allet view . here , the colour name can also be changed .
it can also be used to choose . to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cursor . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button .
if the cross box is activated cursor under the button color , the color is inserted from the color panel on the cursor . the color is either inserted or over@@ writes a different ; depending on whether the mode over@@ write is chosen . this mode can be set by selecting the crossing account under Bei@@ m cursor .
a selection that was created as described in the last section can be used together with the actions of copying , cut and inser@@ ting .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the clip@@ board : for each color three values for the shares of red , green and blue and an optional colour name , followed by a tick @-@ end characters , if another color follows . if so three num@@ eric values are inserted in the clip@@ board , this can be inserted as a color in &amp; c@@ color@@ edit ;
the colors in the range and output of the color selection can be drawn with the mouse .
a color can choose somewhere on the screen and then select it in the color selection on the left .
&amp; k@@ graphically viewer ; is a KDE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ ene ; -@@ dot ; graphs are used in science , especially in computer science . so far there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visualize graph@@ ene . these programs , the &amp; graph ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; -@@ programs with only a few functions .
the &amp; k@@ graphically viewer ; project has set itself the aim of replacing these programmes through a modern and user @-@ friendly graphic interface with all the functions of a good integrated &amp; KDE ; program .
&amp; k@@ graphically viewer ; is a KDE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ ene ; -@@ dot ; graphs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graph@@ ite ; shows graph@@ ene with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; KDE ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI . it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; K@@ ate ; and &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of graphs in &amp; K@@ ate ; graph@@ ing anew , and in &amp; k@@ graph ; )
menu to open graphs in &amp; K@@ ate ; open or drawing the graphs in &amp; k@@ graph ; in one &amp; K@@ ate ; - component to open
download large graphs ( currently there are problems with about 1000 knots and a h@@ ack to present more than these knots )
additional needed software : &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; is a &amp; KDE ; program that pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph ; tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of graphs are pres@@ upp@@ oses in detail :
the main window shows the opened graphs , each inserted in its own sub@@ window . in this case , the main window is empty as in the bottom scre@@ enshot . in this case , the toolbar icons will only open the icon and the ( empty ) list Fin@@ ally opened files . click on the first icon to open the dialog file .
after having selected one or more &amp; dot ; files selected , the main window looks like in the bottom scre@@ enshot :
as you can see , an overview in the corner is displayed when the graph is bigger than the drawing area . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( high and r@@ th@@ under without special ta@@ sts , left and right at pressing &amp; alt ; button ) ;
the zoom is limited in both directions by factor 10 . below you can see the maximum reduction of a graphs .
if the file is currently in &amp; k@@ graph , loaded file from another program , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the Grap@@ h is to be re@@ charged or if you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graphically viewer ; your decision may also remember , so later as procedures will change . if you want to change your decision later , you can set the menu item Settings col@@ graph@@ viewer ; set up ... see also .
if you open a graph outside a current &amp; k@@ graph viewer , and eg ; in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graph ; an instance , or want to display the graphs in a sub@@ window of the already running instance .
as with the last option you can save your choice permanently , but also change it with the furniture dialog .
at the program start , you can open all graphs of your last session again . again , you can save your choice both as well as change later .
you can also specify how the Grap@@ h should be divided into several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical sites can be chosen freely .
when you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graphs are to come into one side , the aspect ratio is ignored . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled with the respective parts of the graph .

the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical localization allows to add GPS coordinates to the metadata of an image and edit it . the geographical data is stored in the EX@@ IF keywords and localization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical localization provides tools available to locate images geo@@ graphically in the spher@@ ical coordinate system , which is used by GPS and Galileo . height , long@@ it@@ ud@@ ge@@ - and l@@ atitude are used .
to cor@@ relate your images with geographical data , you need a GPS loop as XML file in g@@ p@@ x @-@ format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ p@@ sman can download and convert the data to you from your GPS device .
image Geo@@ graphical localization Kor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can lead to a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . to load a possible cor@@ relation over time and localization through , you need to load a trace file with GP@@ X file . of course this file contains data the same time at the same places as the pictures of your camera .
if the file loaded an automatic cor@@ relation , the coordinates in red shows . GPS Sp@@ ur@@ data are recorded in GMT . this can be done with the time zone . this can be done with the time zone . set here your camera @-@ zone .
the adjustment for the maximum time devi@@ ation gives an upper devi@@ ation for the GPS time and camera . lies the devi@@ ation below that the data will be merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you do not have any trace data from one place for images you can edit the g@@ p@@ x file manually and add to the pictures . the difference between 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all images in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ishing and differential in minutes can be used if you do not have the appropriate data . if you know that in reality a locality in a great time difference between camera and GPS lies , you can put these limits here and then press the button to inter@@ pol@@ ate the inter@@ pol@@ ishing .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful when you have made a number of photos at the same place . since the dialog box the coordinates of a call to the next , you just need to use the button OK to put the data in the current photo .
the locality can also be found with the displayed map and can be found . select this for the relevant region and enlarge si@@ e.@@ Add this over and over again . the height must always be manually selected . the card can be changed between map mode , satellite view and a mixed mode .
completely outside of the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are ways to hang the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that the exi@@ bitions uses to provide a st@@ acks of pictures with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums into a gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can choose the albums exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for HTML pages . the character set is UT@@ F @-@ 8 in order to enable the best possible internation@@ alization .
the module has four riders where the settings can be adjusted . the rider selection allows all the albums to choose from . the albums are not hierarch@@ ically displayed . the albums are not hierarch@@ ically displayed . with the three buttons on the right , you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below , the Al@@ ben@@ vor@@ schau and the text that will appear in the header of the HTML page will appear .
the rider appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each side . this rider is largely explained . the option for each image created a page created a gallery where each image is displayed in which image is displayed . otherwise , the picture is displayed right with your default image , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show , displayed
the tab album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be saved with all your associated pictures . select a folder on which you have to write writing . a sub@@ folder with the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export , which contains everything , will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG file format , EX@@ IF data of your original images are also saved in the new pictures .
with different colors of color , you can change the default color deep . naturally , the file size also influences the file size . all other settings are evident .
the rider thumb@@ nails allows you to customize some of the settings from the album rider for the thumb@@ nails , which are small pictures that are displayed in the gallery .
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press Enter to break the process .
when the module creates the pages the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore read the Program@@ mer to determine whether errors occur during generating . the web browser will automatically start to display the gallery . press Sc@@ out to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I image den@@ ser is a very fast and flexible OpenGL @-@ based tool to preview images .

after starting , a picture is displayed by default in full screen mode . this can be changed into a window @-@ mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG ow@@ s@@ free module is a tool to change images without compromising quality .
this module allows to save images in the JPEG format below , without the usual losses of quality or metadata .
the consequence of the loss @-@ free storage it is that the file size is rising as no compression of the color information occurs . this can be found e.g. in PNG format again .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool that allows you to connect your computer to a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module digital camera air has not currently no documentation . if you are interested in writing them , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I teams under KDE Imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. notice : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module meta @-@ editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation please contact the mailing list of KDE @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the import -@@ function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . just select the file sel@@ ector dialog with which you want to copy the target image , so the image to which you want to copy the metadata . the data will be copied after clicking on the button OK .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but do not write in every target format . JPEG is assisted by writing . please check out exi@@ v@@ 2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ zer module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slideshow .
the module MPEG Ko@@ di@@ ers can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length , to convert . this module uses the packages of M@@ j@@ pe@@ g@@ tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck . between the individual pictures you can insert a base imaging . you can also add a audio file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the di@@ asch@@ au .
all images are sc@@ aled to the correct size for the chosen video format . in addition , you can select a background color for the slideshow . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you must first select the images to be packed into the MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au . after that , you can use the extras MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au to start the module .
the images you selected are then en@@ umer@@ ated by image files in the portfolio . there you can also change sorting images or the contents of the list .
once you are satisfied with your list , you should choose the other settings from different formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and CD . if you &apos;re planning to select the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate TV Standard PAL , Sec@@ am or NT@@ SC . PAL is pres@@ et and most probably the right choice for Europe .
in the next step you should indicate the time in seconds the one image is displayed . the speed of the image is set below . a low value creates a sudden , a high level of contrast very smooth @-@ change .
the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should leave them black . the name and path of the created file can be set under name of the MPEG output file . keep in mind as possible as possible .
if you specify a audio file under name of audio source file , this will be integrated into the movie . depending on the button encoding code you can start with the button encoding . depending on the speed of your computer you can now take a cup of coffee and enjoy the di@@ asch@@ au when you are back .
if a note appears that Ko@@ di@@ ers or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ pe@@ g@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck packages on the right bottom right below .
the printer wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo@@ sizes . the combined images can also be automatically opened by image processing Gimp . this is e.@@ g : sensible to print you or print the Gimp module for direct expression .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import and convert your images stored in one of three formats of JPEG , TIFF , or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w from Dave Coff@@ in . an original image of Him is : expect from d@@ cra@@ w not that it creates the same results as the software from your camera manufacturers . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w better results ! .
first select the raw file to be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w image kon@@ verter window appears in mode for a single image . with the button preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the image .
you can now re@@ adjust the values to the conversion process . the first option decides whether the camera settings are to be used for the white @-@ off . the essential parameters such as gam@@ ma , brightness and red / blue amplifier can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal you can edit the picture later on .
a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be chosen so that you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in R@@ GB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switches has no effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion results . the fil@@ ename remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a los@@ sy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
the Equ@@ itable Image format , TIFF , keeps all the information of your image and uses the los@@ s@@ free L@@ Z@@ W compres@@ sing .
if you are planning to use your pictures frequently , or later you don &apos;t want to use the JPEG format , since it is only a limited number of operations , the image quality is deteri@@ or@@ ating . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you choose JPEG as a storage format , the metadata in the raw file are stored in the JPEG file in the EX@@ IF data .
if you have adjusted your settings , you can start using the button button to start the conversion . if you want to cancel this process again , you can break down .
the st@@ acking mode allows you to convert various images to once . use this mode therefore if you are sure , for example through testing in a single image , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images . however , this is helpful if they have been created in an earlier trial . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar is not available as far the conversion is advanced .
this module can be used to re@@ comp@@ ress all images in one album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used for ren@@ aming all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the starting number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the ones shall set .
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a picture collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck Package . you can make the picture res@@ ized or enlarge .
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal changes in a dimension . the width or height of the image is automatically selected , depending on the image orientation , selected . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option e.g. to adjust your image to the screen format .
not proportional : not dis@@ proportionate size in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed during this option .
printing preparation : prepar@@ es the image for the photo printing . the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the phot@@ op@@ ap@@ i@@ ers . the target image , including background size , size and background color , is adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected pictures with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the first pictures previously . further images can be drawn on the list of images and disc@@ ard them there .
after you started the module , the images window will be displayed with the images selected by you . you can add further images using a file sel@@ ector dialog . for the last displayed picture , a preview will be displayed on the right .
you can also drag pictures to the picture list and take it in order to add images to the list of images .
the pictures will remove pictures from the list of images to be removed .
once you have selected all images you can open the new message -@@ window of your e @-@ mail clients . you only need to add the addresses and the subject to your e @-@ mail . the images you selected have already been attached to the app@@ endi@@ x .
be sure to send out too many pictures at one time . most e @-@ mail accounts have restrictions on the size of answering e @-@ mails . it may be a good idea to send several mails when you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window will be used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is saved and every time re @-@ used until you change it .
select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field below .
if you use the Google Mail service , you must install the GM@@ ail@@ Agent on your computer before using the GM@@ ail@@ Agent . you can download this here .
after the selection of comments in a specified file , the comments to the pictures will be added together into a text file and attached the mail .
the PNG format under the menu images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted among the los@@ s@@ free formats such as TIFF . therefore , you should not use PNG if you have a quick Internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend you the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG using images file format and select the original files in the JPEG format , then the original Ex@@ i@@ f@@ data are added to the den@@ ds .
when the process is finished , the window will not be closed automatically so you can view the status messages , in search of errors , can view . your e @-@ mail program will be started automatically at the end . with the button Connect , you can fold this window ? en .
after starting the module &apos;s advanced Di@@ asch@@ au , a window with questions like you would like to have shown your slideshow . you can choose from here between the chosen and all the images of the album .
the option OpenGL transi@@ tions in the presentation uses a very elegant picture @-@ transi@@ tions by OpenGL . however , you need to have an appropriate graphics card , since otherwise the di@@ asch@@ au will be very slow .
the fil@@ ename option indicate that the file name of the images are displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation .
the loop loop ensures that the presentation is displayed in an end loop . you can then manually cancel it with Es@@ c .
the option pictures random@@ ly select that the images are displayed in a random order . so it will not be the order of the images used in the album .
among the pictures between the pictures can be set the temporal distance between the individual pictures . 1500 mill@@ ise@@ con@@ ds match 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and your chosen transition effect . so you should show that before you show the presentation to your friends !
there are more than a dozen transi@@ tions between which you can choose . acci@@ dentally , choosing a different effect during each transition between the pictures .
during the di@@ asch@@ au you can access a toolbar at the top left side of the screen . move the mouse in this corner to turn on you .
with this toolbar you can hold the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and the next picture and stop the slideshow .
at the left side of the screen you can see the current fil@@ ename , the position of the current picture and the total number of images in your presentation .

the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to set a picture as a background image for the working surface .
this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the chosen option of the sub@@ menu , as a background for your KDE labels .
once you have provided your pictures and videos with notes , you can see with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , see picture . as you can see by a comparison with the image , are now available in each group , so in individuals , places and in group keywords entries .
in the browser window you will see the categories , for which you have entered information as you have provided your pictures and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations . additionally , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , to view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course the current thumb@@ nails . in the following , each is described for themselves .
when you press the mouse on the entry , the view of the browser is changing . see picture .
if you choose to select another person only the images are displayed on which both individuals are visible . through this selection method you can restrict the number of images displayed from a few thousand images to a few individual images .
if you have selected all the persons , places and other settings , you can view with thumb@@ nails to view the images of your degree .
in the picture every person has the same symbol in front of her name . however , you can save with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person a separate preview image , this also applies to places , keywords and other categories that you have defined yourself . see the picture .
to view images in addition to the name , select the button that you want to use on the right outside on the toolbar . this has the advantage that you can display the view for each category . this has the advantage that you can display for example symbols with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords can be displayed ( if you do not have appropriate pictures for your keywords ) .
you must also specify which image for each individual person is to be displayed . to view this , you &apos;ll have to select the image @-@ in window ( in detail ) and select in the context menu item you can customize the image factor according to your wishes and thus choose which part of the image is to be shown or cut off .
when you access the entry in the main window , you will see a dialog that is very similar to the dialog for the fixing of the image properties . this dialog can look at the picture again .
if you enter a string into the box or description , the cap@@ tions and descriptions of images will be searched for this text . if you like , you can also choose a date that should be searched for example , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the lower part of the window you can browse all images according to certain names as you can see in the picture . here is according to pictures , on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are pic@@ tured .
this is the user &apos;s manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; . if you do not like to read hand@@ books , but rather try to try out functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual :

start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and select in the first dialog the demo , in case you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select in the menu Help menu entry album ; -@@ Demo . subsequently , some sample pictures will be loaded and you can try the features of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try .
if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a related HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar see here : . as the name suggests , this body shows you data statistics about the images in your database .
the tim@@ eline can display several different tim@@ ings . each body shows a different unit . you can change between the units of years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the ly@@ ste only 10 @-@ minute head@@ ings .
the tim@@ eline can use it on the following ways : you can change the displayed records preview view from the database ( if you select a date , the first image of this date in the preview displayed ) and also shows the tim@@ eline always displayed the current date of the currently displayed pictures when you navigate in the Preview View .
you can also select a section of the tim@@ eline by holding the mouse button pressed and the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. record information , will display you in the preview view only images of this time period . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a beam of the tim@@ eline .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; puts you two possibilities to create HTML websites with your images ; the one is available in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other as a module available ( see ) . in the following part of the user &apos;s manual , which is described in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version that you can create about the File HTML menu .
before HTML pages , you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and finish . in the following , each area is described more accurately .
first , enter the title of the bli@@ cks and a description which should contain the HTML file later . on a photo@@ album , HTML @-@ example pages you will see an example of these settings .
next select whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; -@@ Export file will be created , which is to be seen on the overview page . nutritional information on export files can be found in .
finally , you can select which information is displayed on the HTML pages . therefore , you can avoid that information is displayed on the viewer . for example , all pictures of a party are obvious . note that all pictures are exported from a party . you can therefore not use this attitude to hide certain images from certain views .
in this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are clearly , which is not specifically received on these pages .
at the bottom of the page you can view different resolutions for the images . this means that those who have viewing your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no images can download the resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the spect@@ ator of your site can change the resolution at any time you fixed . so he can search your images with low resolution , which leads to a lower transmission time , so if he wants to see a picture bigger , he changes to a higher resolution .
in this setting , you put the different folders and URL where your website is stored .
you are best to select a base folder for all your HTML files and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set .
first , you need to select the main folder in which all of your images are saved . this folder will be saved and automatically added at the next time . this folder allows you to select either a folder or one of KDE supported protocol , for example :
after you have created your pictures , you can check if these really are all for viewers . if you were created for the base folder a URL , after the pages have been created , this folder should be here . otherwise the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder , you need to manually copy them . so that the import function , see , properly functions you need to specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the basic folders in which all sub@@ folders are located .
the just described settings have all three on the base folders and URLs related . in this one sub@@ folder is laid out , whose name you set up in output folders .
if you &apos;re talking about a family party , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you might want to create an HTML page to view the images . if you have already spent quite a lot of time to consider the images , reception location , etc . then you have to do with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this work doesn &apos;t even have to do .
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images to a .@@ k@@ im file . you can import others into your database . the image features will be imported with ex@@ ams and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in whether the images are stored in the file or if the file is only a link to pictures . the advantage of all images contained in the file is that you have all the images together , and that file can be passed independently . the obvious disadvantage is however the file size .
you can edit a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the File menu or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with a HTML file , this will create an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in two ways . first , the images are displayed in the folder of .@@ k@@ im file . if the corresponding pictures are not found , so the images are specified in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using HTML export .
in the following , the dialog is described for exporting images that you can access the File Ex@@ por@@ e menu .
the most important option of this dialog is whether it is to act internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available :
if you prefer to copy the images to the .@@ k@@ im file , you need to copy the images in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the option Autom@@ atically in the vicinity of the .@@ k@@ im @-@ file copy and k@@ photo@@ album ; the images are automatically copied for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . because most images have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself very small is worth it usually not comp@@ ress the files . if you want this nevertheless , you simply select the option export file .
the last option of this page is to limit maximum image size . if you want to send your friends pictures , you might not want to limit the images in full size , because the .@@ k@@ im file is otherwise very large . here you can say the size , by example , that every picture should be at most 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu file Im@@ por@@ e ... selecting , will import &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in it .
the wizard for impor@@ ters consists of four steps . first , you need to select which images you want to import , then in which folders to import images to be copied .
it may be that you person@@ alize the category of persons of the file person@@ er ( if you are a Dan@@ e ) , while this category is called for your database . therefore , you will be imported in the third dialog box , which categories of the imported file should be imported into your database and which categories are to be imported into your database .
in the fourth step you can import the categories of imported file with the categories of your current database . one example will see you on the image .
it has to be easy to browse and viewing images : if you look at images , you often want to view pictures of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend on it , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is pic@@ tured .
in this hand@@ book , you will find the different steps from ( 1 ) fixed the information about your images , via ( 2 ) to search through ( 2 ) advanced topics and adap@@ tations .
K@@ Photo@@ album was started as a program for managing your images . it has been extended and today , it also takes care of your videos . in many places in this hand@@ book will be talked about pictures , but frequently this also closes videos with one .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; saves all of his information in the file inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml in the top folder of their images . this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. normal backup tools , copy to a flo@@ ppy disk or revisions in CV@@ S , where they want .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; notice the folder in which your images are stored and used automatically . if you want to start another database in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so if you want to start another folder tree with pictures , you can start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; with the option -@@ c . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / Company / inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml .
via the menu entry menu button , set up ... you can get to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; photo album ; in the following sections of the user manual , you will find the various settings options .
at the left you can see six different symbols , with which you can access settings options and options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available , which you can call through a button on the F1 key and a click on the desired option .
it was described in you how you can set various properties , e.g. persons , places and keywords for each image . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums .
you can see dialogue which is used to work already existing groups . for each existing group you can select a let@@ tering and a symbol .
in the section categories , sub@@ categories were already mentioned . in the dialog options , you can set up complete membership groups , i.e. , e.g. all members of a group at once in a group rather than in a group .
in view of the settings , which are available to you for fixing the members of the members . with the above listed list , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left of Fen@@ als , you can find a list of the current categories and in the right a list of categories .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; shares his modular system with other graphic applications such as the K@@ IP@@ I and G@@ wen@@ view . this module is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; KDE ; image plugin interface . nutritional information can be found on the website of Ki@@ pi .
the modules can be accessed via the menu modules . the modules can and are not described in this manual as they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , but most modules have a help page that you can access via the modules itself .
since the modules of multiple applications can be used together , it may be that the modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . therefore , you should always test new modules first with the demo database before you access it to your own images . demo version -@@ demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or via the menu Help . say not , I would not have warned you !
the applications that use the modules above K@@ IP@@ I , are very different , making it possible that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not work . this is the disadvantage if you share functions with various applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications simply use their images into albums : this kind of order is not supported , sim@@ ulates it for some modules the order after albums , so you can use the features with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album .
thereby sim@@ ulates &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which simply corresponds to the current view , thus all images , which show you the pic@@ tured look at the moment .
in addition to the current album , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , the modules also has to pass a list of albums . here is the photo album follows :
if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s Browser shows the content of a category , for example all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module .
or it will be the category that you have defined in the menu dialog as category for virtual albums , so if you use the category Persons , will do it , so if you have chosen individuals to view and to share this module .
since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not compatible are you to remove them from the list of modules . start the settings dialog , and select the modules that modules are loaded .
on the picture you will see an example of a starting screen when you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; with your own images .
as you are used it from any other KDE application , you will see the window with which you have entered the window with which you have entered your image database . in the section we will not find out any information about your images , but in the section we will show you an overview of all existing images to show you an overview of all existing images .
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to view every picture with notes , where the image was recorded , etc . you can set each image either individually or for a larger number of images certain notes at the same time . if for example , on all pictures Jes@@ per , and all pictures were recorded in Copenhagen .
all these notes can be used for searching and browsing , as you can read in the section . if you want you can see these notes if you use the built @-@ in viewer .
in view of three lists of a text field by choosing people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; because you will always use them again if you want to use information about your pictures .
the following idea lies the moving of images inside the list : if you have shown for example a family party and shown on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 persons , you can see that the used names are moved up , the people can find faster and arrange .
if you prefer to get an alphabe@@ tical list displayed , click on the symbol for sorting by date under the list .
if you have selected comments for each image individually , you might want to edit any selected pictures and provided them with a comment . click in this case simply to the above and back buttons , which are underneath the thumb@@ nail on the right .
if you have multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these images and to use the menu item multiple entries at once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . there are also San Francisco and Los Angeles in California .
in the picture you will see a browser window that displays the USA as a super@@ group . to view you that it is a super@@ group , a special symbol is shown .
in the context menu of the menu feature , you can add an entry to an existing or new over@@ - or sub@@ category . additionally , you can also drop a entry into a category and take up there to make this one sub@@ category of this entry . attention , this requires that you just sort out your categories alphabe@@ tically . see this .
you can post@@ p@@ one the individual elements of the issue , by moving the edge , which form the edge of the frames , click and move . you can also make a separate window from a frame to pull it out of the window range .
if you have adjusted the look of the window to your needs , you are satisfied with the settings , click on the button options ... which offers you the possibility to save the current structure and appearance of the window .
you can also hide a frame completely . if you want to see this window again later , use the button options ... and then you will see windows a / hide . this process can be seen in the picture .
when you select the entry pictures in the browser , you will get an overview with thumb@@ nails of the currently selected images , or any images in case you have no filter . you can configure the size of the thumb@@ nails , by simply clicking the mouse button with the middle mouse button , configure . try it simply times .
when you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this picture is furnished as background image for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , this is displayed in the picture frame . if you have not opened any window with an image press , a new scor@@ eboard will be created .
you can also delete images from the thumb@@ nail . simply select the appropriate images from which you want to delete and select either the removal button or select in the Edit menu . now , you will see the window that you can see in the picture .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can also use pictures without saving you on your hard drive . of course you have to save the images somewhere , so that you can record the pictures somewhere . in the picture you can see the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required images can be loaded from the disk .
images , where the right upper corner is cut , are not stored on the hard disk . however , for example , the thumb@@ nails are available for example . for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , however , the thumb@@ nails will show you . however , the preview of these images can be displayed . however , you can also look at these pictures with the image .
as you see , this function needs you to copy files from folders and again . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; supports it until now , not to request the inser@@ tion of the relevant CD . if you want to avoid trouble how to avoid the mess of your images , please buy a bigger hard drive to save all images on it .
in the menu pictures you will find a sub@@ menu with your name privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , filter the pictures so that you want to make for other in@@ accessible , and click on current view inside the menu privacy . alternatively , you can also see all pictures that may see your little sister , anst@@ eu@@ ers and the menu entry everything except actual view .
this means you have specified which images are to be hidden in the case of the case . if you give the laptop now your little sister , simply select the menu entry images , which will have locked up , which you have locked up , click lock to lift up .
it is also possible to specify a password that needs to be entered in order to set up the images . to set up this password , simply select the password in the menu privacy .
please bear in mind that this picture protection is not very safe at any time . for one there is all the images on the hard drive and on the other one can easily read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection serves only to those who are familiar with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar to rec@@ tify the view of private pictures .
the reason why you can manage all of your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; naturally manage and hours over hours to describe it is of course that you want to look at them at some time . for this reason , you can see them at some time . this is why you can preview out a picture _ and video clip . you can preview them from the preview as described in .
the observer you can see in . of course it shows the image , but additional all the information you want to enter over the picture , such as who is on the picture when and where was it done , etc .
if the Info@@ box on the upper part of the picture you want to see , you can easily drag and drop it out elsewhere . you can also configure what information is displayed and whether information is displayed . all these options are displayed after a right @-@ click on the viewer . you can see the context menu , you can see below .
some words in the Info@@ box are underlined . if you click here on the browser , see the appropriate entries to this display . so if you click to Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you were people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene chose .
if you have loaded multiple pictures in the viewer , you can switch between them and use the buttons picture high and image . you can jump to the first and last image with Pos@@ 1 and end . these features can also be reached from the context menu .
if multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can run it as di@@ asch@@ au . then a new image can load a few seconds . how often it load a new image can be controlled by pressing the C@@ trl key and plus or minus . started and stopped the di@@ asch@@ au through the buttons C@@ trl ; S .
a very useful ability of the be@@ holder of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it is used in full @-@ screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the entire place on the screen . simply use the input button to switch back into full @-@ screen mode and back .
when you use the viewer , you can simply drag a rectangle with the mouse . with the minus button you can simply drag the plus button in the middle of the picture . shows how an zoom rectangle is marked and displays the result of the zoom .
with the point button , you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not displayed zo@@ omed . with the Equ@@ al speaker sets the zoom , so that every pixel corresponds to the screen of a pixel of the image .
note that the only Zo@@ om@@ oper@@ ations will work with videos that in and out with the plus and the key .
with the turn@@ key functions from the context menu , you can spin the image . this does not work with videos . you can make comments to the current picture with the menu item , from the context menu .
if you consider images it can happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten on the picture . at the moment you can preview the image and open configuration dialog in the image to indicate that name . however , you will just prefer to highlight the picture and consider additional pictures .
another situation is that you would like to send a printer to a printer to get the pictures on paper . to see what photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad while watching one by one .
for the two examples above gives you the viewer the opportunity to view images with characteristics while you look at them . characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can put a characteristic that you press the corresponding letters . in view a picture in which the features A , B and C are set .
once you have set features on your images , these are available to you in the browser . so you can use all the images you want to edit , print or whatever you have selected , so you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and special features can display in the thumb@@ nail . if you display categories in D@@ re thumb@@ nail , then you can press features to the pictures by pressing the letters for the feature , after the picture was chosen . this can be seen here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case allows you to paint &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; on the picture to paint .
the mixture is not saved with the image but in the database . on the way you can und@@ o your painted later .
in a picture you can see an image on the measured album . to turn off the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then click on the painting from the context menu . to finish the M@@ alen , simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; you need to control the application of the program &amp; Pov@@ ray ; but the documentation for &amp; Pov@@ ray ; should you absolutely read and understand .
in the object tree , you can select single objects . then their properties in the object properties are displayed and the object in the wire mod@@ ell@@ - views are shown in yellow .
you can also select multiple objects simultaneously . but not the object of an already selected object , since all sub@@ properties are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the toolbar or select a menu entry in the menu inser@@ ting .
is there multiple possible positions , the following set @-@ up menu appears , so that you can choose the correct position :
either from the menu bar under edit or from the context menu of the right mouse button , you can remove selected objects from the scene before .
if you have changed properties , click on to apply these changes . have invalid values , a message is displayed with a fault description . then you can click the input images and apply the changes with abor@@ ting .
if you enter the path to &amp; Pov@@ ray ; user documentation in the furniture dialog , you can call the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; reference to the object shown with help .
you need the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this property . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
if you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can preview the peculi@@ ar view .
click on preview in the peculi@@ ar view and a small example of the scene is selected using the selected texture , even if you want a subordin@@ ated element ( for example , a texture inside a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , you can cross locally .
the scre@@ enshot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag and change these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is chosen , the control points and there will be a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the centre for sc@@ aling and spin as well as the position for de@@ port@@ ations . you can change the shift through drag the mouse within the whole window .
each object has a visual @-@ level of visibility . you can specify this value relative to the visibility level of the above @-@ level object or as absolute value . objects are only displayed when they are selected or their visibility @-@ stage is smaller or equal to the stage of the toolbar of the scene .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; has a window @-@ order as default . the object tree and view of object properties are displayed left and the four graphical views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the default window , or if you need a different order , you can set it any number . you can also save multiple shut@@ ters and simply switch between different orders .
to anchor a window over or under a available view , drag the beginn@@ er to the top or bottom of a view . a rectangle shows then the new position .
to create a new column , drag the beginn@@ er to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anch@@ ored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height .
if you would like to assign several views to each other , drag the beginn@@ er in the middle of another view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the cart@@ els of cart@@ ons on top of the views .
the last possible window @-@ order are sul@@ king views : views that are not anch@@ ored in the main window . to view a view from the anch@@ oring , drag the beginn@@ er to the desktop or click on the little ones left at the top left of the starter bar .
to view a view , click on the small cross in the thread bar . to avoid the closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can insert additional views in the main window . in the menu View you will find entries for any type of views . new views are sound@@ ing , you can anchor them at any place .
the current window @-@ screen can save you with view window order ... to save it . it will display a dialog where you can save the window @-@ order under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can ren@@ ders them . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; used &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program needs to be properly installed . as this manual was written , &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.5 current . this version is currently supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; version 1.0 does not support .
to ren@@ ders the current scene , click on the icon ren@@ ders in the toolbar or select the menu entry view .
a R@@ ender mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; Pov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and the quality of ren@@ ders . if you want to ren@@ ders a scene in various image sizes and quality levels , you can insert as many ro@@ ender modes , from a quick preview up to complete pictures of the highest quality .
if you click on the icon The R@@ ender settings in the toolbar or in view R@@ ender modes ... select the following dialog :
each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , useful is a name that lets you recognize the properties of the mode .
in the map card size you can enter the width and height of the rounded image . if you want only one small area of the image , select the cross section and enter the image section to ren@@ ders into the input fields .
in the Kom@@ bin@@ ational field you can select the properties that uses &amp; Pov@@ ray ; for rendering it from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user reflections . a detailed description of the R@@ ender &apos;s properties can be found in the user &apos;s manual to &amp; Pov@@ ray .
when a picture appears with only one ray per pixel , there may be different mistakes . these images often have a mo@@ ir@@ è @-@ pattern or stu@@ ff@@ ed effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not shown if they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called Ali@@ asing .
&amp; Pov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of these errors . generally , pictures with this property look better .
if you turn anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calculated and connects &amp; Pov@@ ray ; more than a ray per pixel . this technique is called great sampling .
&amp; Pov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because the super @-@ sampling is adapted to the adjacent pixel . the second method is adap@@ tive ; recur@@ sively , because every pixel is repeatedly re@@ distributed and adap@@ tive because the refle@@ x sti@@ cker depends on the calculated colour values .
when you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray pursu@@ its a ray of pixels . if the difference between color values to the adjacent pixel are processed , a grid of 4x@@ 4 additional points will be calculated , at a depth of 5 then 5@@ x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
diff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ B 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 beams per pixel . if the difference between the color values indicated the pre @-@ given threshold , then the pixel is divided in 4 sub@@ pixels that can be pursued individually and tested on further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be set with the depth .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is that the production of smoke for the beam process called J@@ it@@ tering . if you turn J@@ it@@ tering , changed &amp; Pov@@ ray ; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for quality of Ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; Pov@@ ray ; the diff@@ use light re@@ flexi@@ on calcul@@ ates . it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property .
on this map card , you can adjust if the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent when the associated rays have not made object .
opens a new window for viewing the &amp; Pov@@ ray . if &amp; Pov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly , you can find the reason here .
to import a &amp; Pov@@ ray ; choose the menu entry file Im@@ ported ... and select a file in the dialog window .
currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; still not the complete commands from &amp; Pov@@ ray ; when exporting error messages or warnings , a dialog box displays a list of all messages .
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; import this source code between the two special comments / / * P@@ MR@@ aw@@ Beg@@ in and / / * P@@ MR@@ aw@@ end .
you can drag objects from the object tree into the editor to export the source code for &amp; Pov@@ ray . this adds the source code of the object into the opened text file in the editor . to import objects into the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
with copying and inser@@ ting in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; and in your editor you can insert source code for &amp; Pov@@ ray ; likewise .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is Pov@@ ray or x @-@ Pov@@ ray .
if you click on help in the peculi@@ ar view , opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler , the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; user documentation displayed for the displayed object . provide the path to your documentation and the version . supported the versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; Pov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example al@@ timeter ) in the paths to the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; libraries . if you refer to files that are not in the folder of the scene , you also need to enter the path to these files here . if a file is used in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for viewing the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color will be used for viewing the selected control points .
the color of the rectangle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type labels .
you can set the item @-@ catch the points on the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . here you can adjust the grid separately for de@@ port@@ ations , sc@@ aling and rot@@ ations .
larger values indicate a more accurate wire model and thus a better sewing for the objects shown , but require more time to ren@@ ders . for some objects such as the ball , you can adjust the detailed level of the details for two directions .
if you cross the High Detailed view for extended projection screens , all the Dra@@ ht@@ model &apos;s views are further divided when the camera uses an extended projection . extended proj@@ ections are all proj@@ ections with exceptions to the perspective and the vertical proj@@ ections . this property gives a better approach to proj@@ ections , but requires more time to ren@@ ders .
when you show wall is a wall behind the objects , a wall is shown behind the objects . the wall is shown in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colors .
when you show floor , a floor is ra@@ ged below the objects . the floor is shown in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colors .
when you cross shar@@ pen@@ ing plate , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering of scenes . the values for depth and swelling can be set . more exact details of the parameters can be found in the section R@@ ender modes .
on this page you can change existing window regulations or create new window regulations . in the window @-@ regulations , you can create and store window regulations .
the Com@@ bin@@ ational field standard window : displays all existing shut@@ ters . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; used the selected window arrangement when starting the program .
the list of existing shut@@ ters shows all existing shut@@ ters . a new arrangement allows you to create and delete a selected order using the button R@@ emo@@ ve button .
any window @-@ order is identified by the name . the name must be clear and must not be empty .
the list under the name displays all views of the chosen window arrangement . new views can be deleted using the button R@@ emo@@ ve button and remove selected views with the button R@@ emo@@ ve button .
the position of the new window . with New column , you create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with un@@ folded map , you get the window under the existing window , using map card , you will receive a map card screen , together with the previous view and woven , the view is not in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you have just installed &amp; Pov@@ ray ; and now you want to start with no more precise knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this tutorial , you should create the ultimate but easy scene , under beginners very popular : one sphere on one level .
but you should consider the following warnings carefully before you complain that you will get as a result of just a black screen . if you use a 3D program to the first time , you should consider these important rules :
if you do not set a camera , no rules can be applied to ren@@ ders as a result you get a black picture .
if you do not insert light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you just get a black picture .
if you have everything error @-@ free , you will see at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler , following pre @-@ presented shut@@ ters :
take a little time to know the menus and existing symbols of the toolbar . read the documentation so you can get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will often use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and also their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you must first remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu entry . so you have a scene without objects .
the wire model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene that you generate . especially notice that in the fourth wire @-@ model view ( right down ) . this is the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera . this shows you the result of Ren@@ der@@ ns of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if they click on it , you will find the content of the View properties which can be found in the various parameters of the camera . in the user documentation to &amp; Pov@@ ray ; find out more details .
just change the basic settings of the camera , this is later manuals , but note that the camera in view control points can change with which you can change the target point of the camera . simply click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired location .
when using the button or press the input button , the wire @-@ model views and the object tree will immediately change according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the point of view of the camera .
there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . you might add a qu@@ ader ( inser@@ ting body qu@@ ader ) and the size on x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a concrete method to solve this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; actually offers a simpler possibility . you can use an infinite plane as floor :
a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and then press the button or paste the input button . in the object tree , the new name will immediately appear .
the wire @-@ model view now shows the plain , even though at the moment only a limited end@@ ental level . if you want the scene , the layer extends up to the horizon .
when you look at the object tree exactly , you will notice that you click on the icon + in front of the object . in this case you will find the different parameters for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the object Properties .
in this scene you should move the ground to exercise a unit under the horizontal line so you can get to know some of these parameters . select shifting and set the values as follows :
just choose the ground to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose something in the moment .
in both cases a dialog box opens in which you can select how the object is inserted . you can change the name in the property view ( name = floor pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button preview you can see how the pigment now looks .
of course , the preview of pig@@ ments only shows a matt black material because you can still enter settings for the pig@@ ment . therefore , remember that you can check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview . now , there are many possibilities now , but do not take the easiest .
if you &apos;re unable to preview any color on the p@@ ader and ball , click on the button to apply it and then click the Preview button .
the material for the floor is now correctly set . if you want to draw your image now with a click on the icon , you should get the following result :
of course , this is not the color you have expected . here are still other settings necessary . in the Object tree you need to enter two new attributes . then edit this entry twice ( you can also do this more frequently , but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
choose in the object tree every time and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
you should already be able to run this step as you should have understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; you should have understood the ball just as simple as the ground :
in the view of the object properties , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget the input paste or the button ) , so that the ball has pushed into contact with the ground . otherwise , the ball will float above the ground , since you have moved the ground to have a unit down@@ wards .
of course , the rendering is now a strange outcome : how previously to see , the ball surface appears like a matt black material . continue in the following step a suitable material .
if you have chosen the ball , you can assign it to a material now . as already in the ground , you enter the ball a pigment as color :
select your object and change the name for example in sphere pigment . click Ball pigment , select then cat@@ ar@@ able and make the values as follows :
but you can reach more interesting effects if you take the time , stop some finish properties :
then change the values as in the following screen pictures and click to apply or press Enter .
the settings shine effect and reflection result in partly good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med finishes , even if metallic : not yet chosen :
you should now have a good impression of what opportunities you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler offers . hopefully you &apos;ve already learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ tra@@ y@@ earning is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
when you use a scene ray@@ trac@@ en , the rendering of the hypo@@ the@@ tical bla@@ zes out from the perspective of the be@@ holder ( i.e. from the camera , which calcul@@ ates the scenes ) by each pixel in the scene and how atmospheric effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects will impact such as fog . thus , the scene pixels has been processed for pixels .
as you can imagine , you will see nothing without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene . without a light source you also see nothing , the picture is simply black . obviously , every scene , which is to be s@@ cour@@ ged , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog you can select your file . Pov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
open a file . in default file dialog you can select a file which you have previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ;
whenever you open a new model or create , the file is inserted in this sub@@ menu and replaced the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it is stored under the same name . it is a new file , you must enter a name and disk space .
displays the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage are rejected .
this menu entry can only be chosen if you do not have stored changes in the scene .
repeated the last revers@@ ed command . this menu entry can only be chosen if you have used any feedback .
saves the current window @-@ order and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new order or write an existing order .
in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; , here you can change the look , the keyboard short@@ cut and the standard behaviour .
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can change or add new commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler with this option .
opens a dialog to set up the toolbar . you can add and remove a dialog with this option tool icons for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler .
a dump map is a possibility of changing screw surfaces without having to model any b@@ ump on the surface individually and without changing the geomet@@ ric shape of the object itself .
it is custom@@ ary to use the same file for a dump map as well as for a texture map .
basic body are simple geomet@@ ric shapes which you can use as a building blocks : very complex 3D models are made of do@@ zens or even hundreds of this basic body . these models are then further processed to give them a realistic appearance .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixels base , by applying an image file as color card .
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a comfortable image storage and browser browser . the application has a file browser which allows you to select images to display .
images can either be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can view with clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the key Return .
you can adjust if each image is to be displayed in a separate window , or if all images always should use the same window .
if you are looking for a specific file , simply type the first signs of the file name in the browser window . then a small input field is found in the right bottom corner . if a suitable file name was found , the file is highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in dialogue In@@ clu@@ sion - &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; there are five cards cards . in three of them , General and editing and slideshow , you can set the working method of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; set in the two other , short commands for the scor@@ eboard and short command for the browser , you can set the keyboard short@@ cut for the respective window .
if this is selected , the images will be opened in full @-@ screen mode . if the image is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display space filled with the background color that you can set further down . default is not a full @-@ screen mode .
is this point activated , loads &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; already the next picture in the folder , while you still watch the current picture . this reduces the delay if you choose the next picture and is particularly suitable for a slideshow .
with this option saves &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; at the closing the name of the last opened folder . at the next start opens &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
click on the colored beams to select a background color . this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in the window mode the window is bigger than the picture , the background is filled with the selected color .
you can set up &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; so set up that only some of the file types can be displayed , which also can represent the program .
with this option for large images the scor@@ eboard can be enlarged on the full screen . this option is switched on default .
determine if the slideshow is to start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
the time span between the image change in a slideshow . to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the sli@@ ders or the small arrows right next to the input field . the default is 3 seconds .
the number of repeti@@ tions is set to 0 , the slideshow is repeated until it is canc@@ eled by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the sli@@ ders or the small arrows right next to the input field . the default is 1 .
change the keyboard short@@ cut for the different modes of cards from &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in cart@@ cards short commands for the scor@@ eboard and short @-@ command for the browser .
this option allows you to switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folder and a window for the files ) and the partial view of the file system with folders and files in a window .
displays large symbols for files in the folder . this display is only possible in short @-@ setting .
displays small symbols for files in the folder . this display is only possible in short @-@ setting .
displays thumb@@ nails for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in short @-@ setting .
the picture is reduced by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
the image is increased by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
closes the scor@@ eboard for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; will also be closed if no browser window is opened more .
view the image in original size . this is only useful when automatic sc@@ aling is activated .
opens the input field for completion . enter the first signs of the fil@@ ename you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a &amp; KDE photo editing based on the &amp; digi@@ tization ; image editing . &amp; show@@ photo ; is part of the &amp; digi@@ ous ; project .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a quick image processing with some powerful basics . you can use it to view your photos and perform correc@@ tions and changes .
like the rest of &amp; KDE ; it is a show@@ picture ; an open source project . this means it depends on the user to share his portion , at least problems and possible improvements .
&amp; show@@ photo ; makes it easy to register as easy as possible errors or any possible improvements . this displays a dialog with a link . if you use this , your browser opens a page to the reports of problems and wishes . all required information is already completed , and you can simply follow the instructions to post your message .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a project that is supported by a community . that means that users and developers want to help each other . if you are a common user of &amp; show@@ photo ; however , we would like to answer you questions to other users of &amp; show@@ foto . however , you can answer any questions about other users at this mailing list . however , in this mailing list , you should be powerful in this language .
the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ foto ; to participate , it is the developer mailing list included . guidance to join the developers mailing list of &amp; show@@ photo ; .
&amp; show@@ photo ; try to give you so much control of their work@@ flows as possible . to access these settings , you have to set up on these settings . setting dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between them by clicking on the symbols of the left @-@ hand side .
in the area of exposure Indi@@ c@@ ers you can select the color that is displayed when the under@@ pin or over@@ exposure indi@@ dic@@ ator should display the colors with what you should display , in contrast . under@@ exposure should display a bright color and over@@ exposure a dark colour .
the main window of &amp; show@@ photo ; owns a side bar on the right edge , which provides you with important information and actions on the selected images . you can also view them in the image editing . you can view it in which you click on one of the five riders below :
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an application to scan images that don &apos;t make any more as images to scan and storing .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application to scan images , which no longer makes a dialog to scan and storing . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; can open a dialog for each image or save the images immediately in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can also display the pictures before storage .
you can check the status of support of your scanner on the SA@@ NE project page by typ@@ ing the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ s@@ ane @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; with the command sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; set in the terminal . if this scanner is not opened or if no standard scanner was specified , a dialog is opened to select the scanner .
the user can select the user to use@@ able scanner and press OK to open the scanner . inter@@ rupt will end &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) , these options are not treated especially .
to view a picture , the user can only start a pre @-@ scan and then scan the scan range for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button .
to choose the picture better the user can adjust the image into the image and out of the current selection out zo@@ oming . it can also adjust the zoom also that the complete preview of the window fits .
when the image was chosen then the final image can be read with the Scan button .
if before saving a preview is selected in the settings , then the image is displayed in a pad@@ lock , as shown below is displayed . when saving pressed , then the picture is saved and s@@ lie ? en leads to a departure and you will return to the main window .
the button settings will be opened by the button settings before the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can view the image if desired , viewing before saving . in this case the option before saving a preview will be selected . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be chosen .
this setting allows them to select the way &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; images store them . dialog for storing any image open the dialog in front of any sc@@ anned image . if you want to save it automatically with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you need to save time without using a fil@@ ename .
this setting defines where the images can be saved on the option save without a file name . if the images are stored after each scan , then this folder will be used as a standard for dialogue for saving . the default value is your home directory and you can change it with the button ...
this parameter defines a picture fix for the automatic images and is moreover the proposed name for the image in the dialog for storing . the automatically stored image receives a numerical Su@@ ff@@ ix of every time being uploaded , when a picture is stored . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can customize the image quality . this value also changes the compression value when saving the image quality is not selected , then the standard value of Q@@ t is used .
the button help starts the KDE help with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite . the button About starts the KDE via -@@ dialog for &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; the button settings shows the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to stop &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite .

&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; used like all other programs keyboard short@@ cut . below you will find a list of this cuts and its function . the global short@@ cuts can set up by pressing the right mouse button in the player window and select Global keyboard short@@ cut ... choose by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window and choose short commands ... select .
you may possibly set existing multimedia keys so that they work as &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; therefore , make your keyboard to &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; control center .
the D@@ COP @-@ Interface from Amar@@ o@@ ok has many general functions , which mostly can also be found in other KDE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ COP @-@ functions of collection , context browser , player , playlist , play@@ lists , play@@ lists and scripts . an example will look for the D@@ COP @-@ function break &amp; eg ; to look like this :
Amar@@ o@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; KDE ; . additionally , Amar@@ o@@ ok has some own commands options .
you should give the user a feedback if the script should not be executed due to a lack of dependence . please check in your script if all the required modules are available and use k@@ dialog so that the user note , why a script does not run .
begin &apos; Res@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Er@@ ror error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( KDE bind@@ ings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ binding v@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; exit end
in the folder script / templates you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as a basis for your own scripts , or simply add them to the required functions . you will quickly determine that writing scripts is relatively simple .
with the help of D@@ COP you can exchange your scripts with Amar@@ o@@ ok and Amar@@ o@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the command d@@ co@@ p ; which should be included in each KDE installation .
most scrip@@ ting languages allow the outputs of external programs and commands . it is usually used the Ex@@ ec function . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; relatively easy to be called . here is an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends al@@ erts to all running scripts . for this reason , script should constantly monitor their standard output and respond accordingly to events . of course , a script should ignore the events even if there is no use for it .
configure the script to display the furniture dialog . to save the storing and loading of the furniture you must take care of any script . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the work@@ folder on the folder where all data should be stored .
tr@@ ack@@ change sign@@ aled that a new piece is played . the script could now ask for example ; with D@@ COP @-@ functions further information about the new piece queries ( for example the metadata or the piece ) .
volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ Volume signals a change of volume . the new volume is an integer range between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ ization : sub@@ menu titles are clicked on the path to selected files of the playlist if a user @-@ defined menu entry is clicked on . to add an entry to the menu you can use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ o@@ e@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu ) to remove d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ o@@ Script @-@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; it stops , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok , the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M sends to the script . this signal should be processed to do e. g. for storing data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script Administration can also install script packages that can be downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar @-@ archives ( .t@@ ar ) , which optionally available with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ b@@ z@@ 2 ) , so that the user can detect the archive clearly as Amar@@ o@@ ok script package .
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the extension amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason , you should design@@ ate your script packages right correctly .
the main critic has to be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to obtain the file rights :
if your script is ready , you can upload it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and connect to the wiki script page of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; for your entry to KDE apps , you should use the category Amar@@ o@@ ok , Skri@@ ll .
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; KDE ; . &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful functions and is still surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok , you can simply drag music to the playlist rather than to work through endless menus . maybe you are also looking for a very specific title out of thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; &apos; s collection browser and the quick search will find you to find the piece within seconds .
maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which you would like to hear ? then the playlist browser is exactly the right for you . and if the decision is still hard , the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria .
Amar@@ o@@ ok has an excellent support for Ap@@ ples iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers IF@@ P and many general USB devices . in addition , many different audio systems can be used as you want to listen to your music . these and many other useful functions make Amar@@ o@@ v &apos;s most advanced audio player . Amar@@ o@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right to re@@ experience your music !
usually , one has to insert the Fol@@ der folder of Amar@@ o@@ sources to compile Amar@@ o@@ ok and install :
da &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and v@@ ein , you ought to have when compile no difficulties . if you encounter problems , please tell them in the &amp; KDE ; mail@@ ing@@ lists .
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; like most applications , it has to enable or disable some options that can enable or disable it with the configure script . this is a list of available options .
for some of the comp@@ iling options , certain dependen@@ cies need to be fulfilled so that they can be used . details can be found in the section system requirements .
activ@@ ates de@@ bu@@ gging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; you should use full use .
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; can be set up with the furniture dialog . the furniture dialog has several cards to set up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok .
player window display the player window in addition to the playlist ( or off . if the option is switched off , only the play@@ lists window will be displayed .
tuning bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok has been compiled with support for mo@@ od@@ bar . the option switches the experimental function of the tuning bar@@ ometer .
atmospheric : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok has been compiled with support for mo@@ od@@ bar . this makes the used color scheme for the mood bar@@ ometer .
entry into the music files in the music files : this function is only available if it is enabled for mo@@ od@@ bar . if this setting is activated , .@@ v files are stored on the location of the corresponding music files . otherwise the .@@ html files are stored in the Settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ o@@ bar / mo@@ od@@ bar / ) .
external browser : lets you choose which browser from &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok can be started when a browser is needed .
other browsers are using : here you can specify the path to another browser which is not located in the list .
playlist to store the current playlist automatically saves the current playlist automatically at the end of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current playlist at the end .
relative paths for manual stored play@@ lists : if you activate this setting , &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , use . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files is stored .
up @-@ to @-@ date piece of the piece @-@ change clearly causes that the play@@ lists window is open / ab@@ ro@@ uded to keep the running piece always in the visible window area .
change the context of the context @-@ browser automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is played .
in the section image you can customize &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; the section is in three parts sub @-@ part .
in the fonts section you can use the use of various fonts in &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; otherwise you can use scripts for the following area : play@@ lists window , player window and context browser . press to select ... , so you can choose a desired font out of the selection dialog .
with the selection of custom color scheme , you can also specify the tor@@ ment of your choice and can set a custom color scheme . use the below activated color selection for front and background color .
play will continue playing at the start that &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; after the program start the playback automatically continues with the piece at the point , with which it was stopped at the final cont@@ end .
the on @-@ screen display gives you the inser@@ tions of O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display will be used , a preview of the O@@ SD will display and you can view the effects of all settings in this preview .
the first option is the font . click to select the font to select the desired font for the O@@ SD . the cross @-@ field shadow causes that the text is shown in the O@@ SD .
own colors will use you the possibility to customize the O@@ SD colors for font and background . a click on the color @-@ surfaces opens the dialog for the color selection . if it &apos;s not activated colors will use the pres@@ et &amp; KDE labels .
the input field display text puts the text in the O@@ SD . by type of space requirements , the O@@ SD can be adapted to your own needs . below you will find a list of the available space holder and what they mean .
the option screen is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . this allows you to specify on which screen a multiple @-@ monitor environment should appear the O@@ SD .
the card audio output allows you to select an audio driver from the selection panel . some drivers activate even more settings in this box map .
the card collection is used for setting up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folder , the &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok . to search a folder into the collection , select the crossing area next to its name . this section also includes cross sections fields to insert , as with the selected folders .
sub@@ folders re@@ cur@@ sively : this causes that &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok , both the crossed and their sub@@ folders according to music .
changes : allows &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folders on changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . furthermore , a incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection .
playlist : causes that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; all found play@@ lists in your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection will appear later in the play@@ lists browser .
the part Colle@@ ctive database is used for selecting a database for the collection . the com@@ bin@@ ational field driver : lets you choose between S@@ q@@ l@@ ite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , another set up in the sub@@ window My@@ S@@ q@@ l facility is necessary .
the My@@ S@@ q@@ l facility is used for inser@@ tion of the database for &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; it will enter the machine on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is entered . after that , under the port : the network port is entered under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name , which the connection is made .
use user name : and password : to enter the data required for connection to the database .
the cart@@ oons card supports the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces on a load .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece .
here you enter your username and password for your load .@@ f@@ m profile . if you have no profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send pieces and update the profile : this setting enables it &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; the names of played pieces on your load .@@ f@@ m profile .
you can retrieve similar interpre@@ ters : after activating this setting , &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; a list of similar interpre@@ ters can be accessed in the context browser . note : you may need not load the list in the context browser . note : you need not load a load profile to use this function .
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; eg ; Linux ) . further information can be found in the summary of the functions and the gallery with screens .
Amar@@ o@@ ok requires only the package K@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other KDE packages . you need to install K@@ deli@@ bs ( including the programs contained therein , as &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide on how to compile K@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
some features such as the O@@ SD continue that your window manager will function the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . we try to support Amar@@ o@@ box on all platforms , so we will use K@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because these are ready for an excellent development environment .
probably one of your files will make a mistake in the Tag@@ b library . you can see the file at ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps _ scan@@ .@@ log in . please report this bug to the Equ@@ b developers under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also hang out the broken file that has caused the crash . after that , you can delete the file and create the collection again .
mostly it is that Tag@@ lib cr@@ ashes when reading the meta @-@ information from this file . please report this error to the seminar developers under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database then try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; is a little more mature .
make sure that all of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok have been compiled with the same compiler version . if e.g. &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok have been compiled with GCC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b but with GCC 3.@@ 3.@@ x , then this leads to overthrow the meta @-@ information .
if you use KDE using art@@ s@@ d , then de@@ activate Automatic , if in@@ active for ... in the settings of the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ stage via email ( the e @-@ mail opens automatically at a crash ) . if it is a common back@@ stage , the error will be guaranteed .
this is due to that many programs write data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 into meta @-@ info , but they do not identify as Unicode . the following Perl script fixes the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; The file $ ar@@ g@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3- &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; unless $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ C@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &apos;
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( random mode / repetition / dynam@@ ical playlist ) see in KDE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , the toolbar can easily be forgotten . however , you can click the status De@@ activated on grey and semi @-@ transparent . note that in some cases you have to click on a symbol until this setting shows its effect .
if you receive this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ pixel ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then check out whether Amar@@ o@@ ok &apos;s correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos;@@ em@@ ber@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p Q@@ t .
to fix this bug , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ding Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ o@@ ok finds the right version first .
there are some ways . most installation issues are by the easiest way through the help of a experts your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or in the developers . do they use the forum and the I@@ RC under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ de@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ o@@ ok .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable to search for help . please enter there only one error if something is located in Amar@@ o@@ ist in Amar@@ o@@ himself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; will only appear a blank playlist . how do music come there ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left side and open the folder you want . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
to keep the surface intui@@ tively , the start @-@ off window was converted into the statisti@@ c window . you can find it at extras statistics .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ o@@ 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are for the review by the user , while the points are automatically calculated .
to rate pieces , the playlist must be displayed in the playlist and select column display . click anywhere in the new application column to set the review for a piece . you can also use the short commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works when Amar@@ o@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove , and then click on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then select play@@ lists from the folding menu .
drag a playlist file with your mouse into the playlist and let them fall exactly as you would like to make it with other files too . so simple is that : - )
in the toolbar of the playlist , directly next to adding button , is the button playlist . click on it .
probably you are missing the program x@@ m@@ ms config . install the package x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel and install &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; new . look even after lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ al@@ isations .
the E@@ quali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . besides , you will find it using the menu bar under extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
no . yes , that is true ! not ! &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; used one of the back@@ end independent approach , therefore the real question are which media types supports G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we can support pretty much every single audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and PNG !
it can ! perhaps you use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which can be supplied with default no MP3 dé@@ c@@ or ( for patent @-@ legal reasons ) . the solution : old @-@ F@@ 2 , g@@ g : Red@@ Hat mp3 KDE , input tas@@ sel
start the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s from : - )
if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with Al@@ sa @-@ S@@ ink , the device has to use a mix@@ er . a mix@@ er allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and time simultaneous audio . this can be achieved through a sound card with hardware mix@@ er ( such as SB@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( such as SB@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for AL@@ SA .
the output of this instruction should assist you in finding the problem of a problem and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer you need to specify a different S@@ ink ( e.g. os@@ s@@ sink ) .
this does &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; already . do not forget that media will first be de@@ codi@@ fied . G@@ Stre@@ amer is looking for most people the best choice if you &apos;re looking for a decade or with little over@@ head . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ co@@ ded it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
also X@@ M@@ MS de@@ co@@ ded the data first . G@@ stre@@ amer can spend directly on AL@@ SA , just as well as x@@ ins .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open control center Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable the size of the sound buffer ( real time limit ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ s@@ wr@@ ap@@ pers is su@@ id set :
with KDE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia co@@ dec@@ s that can cause playback . read this error @-@ report . the enlarge of the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA furniture file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help well .
either do not use the Arts drivers , but instead co@@ ver@@ amer or x@@ ins , or install KDE multimedia complete to get the faster Arts Co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ m@@ pe@@ gli@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
pres@@ um@@ ably use the Arts drivers . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver was optimized greatly for analy@@ zer ) , or reduce the size of the Arts buffer in control center and sound &amp; Multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less jobs react to visu@@ al@@ isations . yes , this is an error , please help us to fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to change to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , cr@@ ashes &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; why ?
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all components . run G@@ ST register to register all G@@ ap components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that does not help , you can also ask at the I@@ RC @-@ channel # g@@ stre@@ amer .
try this ( finish Amar@@ o@@ ke before ! ) : - Laden sie ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then run the module folders with G@@ ST @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer config ) and run G@@ ST register again . start now &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok .
please tell us about bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. if you have a full list of suggestions / wishes , send it to our mailing list : Amar@@ o@@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; is an album of the British Mike Old@@ field . I really like it and find that the name sounds good . besides , the name contains the magic K ... : )
thanks to D@@ COP it is already possible . put an alarm in your calendar program and run with the alarm of this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ o@@ player play
this command lets &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; start playing . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok goes before you go to bed then you will have awakened by the gentle tones of music that you have stopped before going to bed .
how to learn the current in &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok , if you are interested in another computer ?
if a functioning SSH environment is present , you can proceed as follows . Diesel command gives you interpre@@ ters and titles of the running piece : SSH -@@ I ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ user name Amar@@ o@@ player now@@ ing
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this requires that your identification is available in the file ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa .
the visu@@ al@@ isations can be separated from the &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok window . click on the keyboard and the current Analy@@ zer opens in an independent , in the size adjustable window .
the combination of Str@@ g + right mouse button puts a piece in the cliff to queue in queue . by pressing the input button after a search in the playlist , the first search results will be played and the search reset .
OK , the Player Window and the playlist have tri@@ ck@@ rich functions , but how does it look with the icon in the system section of the control panel ?
click with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; click on the title of a browser . in the context menu you can select which browsers are to be displayed .
my personal folder $ HO@@ ME is on a NFS @-@ drive . after the start of Amar@@ o@@ ok , the collection database can not be created and the console appear many error messages . what &apos;s now ?
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you need ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ o@@ ok on a local drive , or use am@@ aro@@ k@@ s MySQL support .
place the CD , then click on the audio CD with multiple folders . to read normal read in the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them into the desired target folder in a con@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic code , you instead take files from folders mp3 or og@@ g .

basically , this will fit the previous assessment with a dimin@@ ishing value , based on how often the piece was played . the more often the piece was played , the less influence has every single review on the overall result .
you can enter the review for a piece by yourself by clicking on a column trans@@ cript in the playlist window . then you can select the evaluation of a piece in the playlist window . then , select the evaluation of a piece of button in the play@@ lists . then click with the right mouse button to click on the piece and edit / F@@ 2 . you can also edit the review in dialog metadata .
the developers do not want to release you when you are to publish a stable version of Amar@@ o@@ ok . this means : KDE packages have a fixed publishing plan which is not linked to the short @-@ term plan of Amar@@ o@@ ok .
this is a new feature in Amar@@ o@@ ok that some users can really also find ner@@ v . disable the option symbol in playing animated in the general settings .
the Analy@@ zer is part of the toolbar . select Settings toolbar and take the desired changes there .
download a design or create your own . install this then under Amar@@ o@@ ok ... View context @-@ browser design , click New Design to install ....
the symbol was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) was similar . to avoid difficulties , it was removed .

audi@@ os@@ cro@@ b@@ bler is a free service to the information that will be played on an independent server . the service is free of charge and you only need a free username and a password . Audi@@ os@@ cro@@ b@@ bler is fully supported by &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ist .
if you want to use AL@@ SA , then please use the latest available version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of exhau@@ st and thus also a lot of error reports .
pres@@ um@@ ably , &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok have been compiled before you have x@@ ins or g@@ stre@@ amer installed . therefore , the . / configure routine does not compile this output module . you need to configure &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; new configure and install .
now I have &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; new installed , but the output module still does not appear . and now ?
probably you use a distribution that is installed separately from the actual program . although G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , the necessary development files are missing . you now have to install the package g@@ stre@@ amer de@@ vel . then you need to install x@@ ins @-@ de@@ vel . after that , you have to re @-@ compile and install again for Amar@@ ine ; again , you will need to re @-@ compile and install again .
I get the error G@@ stre@@ amer Cri@@ tical * * : Factory for &apos; ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How can I fix that ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer was compiled with P@@ rel@@ ol , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ et@@ . you need to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without p@@ rel@@ ing . a tip from Mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : use no LD@@ FLA@@ GS if you compile Amar@@ o@@ ok .
I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype au@@ dia / MP4 , although the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ fast is installed .

in this chapter explains how all the features of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok are used , including creating a collection and playlist .
the Player Window is your A @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center . at the top edge of the window is a run text display which shows the current current piece or current current stream . just below is the area , the game time , bit@@ rate and sam@@ pl@@ er@@ ate of the current piece . a click on this field changes the display of the already exp@@ ired game time to the remaining game time of the piece .
in addition , the player window contains a selection of audio analytics , also under the running text display . you can switch through the available analy@@ zer by clicking with the left mouse button on the area .
the &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press d on your keyboard and the current Analy@@ zer is displayed in an independent , enlarged window .
under the cat@@ ching display there are also the buttons PL and E@@ Q . the button PL is activated or de@@ activated the play@@ lists window , while the button E@@ Q is used to set the equ@@ ali@@ zer button .
the rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons , the volume control and the piece of posi@@ tions sli@@ ders . use the sli@@ ders to stop the piece position or volume . with playback buttons , you can start playing / stop and change the next or previous piece .
the use of the built @-@ in E@@ quali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio tracks . there is 17 preferences , from Klassi@@ k up to Techn@@ o , and you can easily create your own preferences .
to display the equ@@ ali@@ zer you use extras E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click the button E@@ Q in the Player window . once you mark the E@@ quali@@ zer E@@ quali@@ zer , the E@@ quali@@ zer is in operation .
the playlist of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; is the most developed playlist of all for &amp; KDE ; available Multimedia Player . you have many functions , which there is in no other player . but let yourself not be deter@@ red from the wealth of functions , they are all easy to use .
the play@@ lists can be divided into two main areas , on the left is the navigation area . in the navigation area you will find some of the excellent functions of the playlist , such as the context browser . on the right is the playlist itself . the playlist is easy to use and yet even more advanced user performance is strong enough .
the context browser displays various information regarding the current piece of space . its appearance can be adapted using the help of context browser design . the context browser contains three sub@@ window : music , text and interpre@@ ts . these three sub@@ window will be seen later in detail . they provide information on the ongoing piece to each of the different aspects .
if you already have previously used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok , you might want to see that the sub@@ window will start off . the information presented here are now collected in other parts of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok . furthermore , the information in the statistical window may be collected ( extras statistics ) .
the sub@@ window music displays information about the current piece , as well as the interpreter and the album .
the first area in this sub@@ window shows information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , interpreter and the album . below you see the cover image of the album and next to a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . click on this icon to hit the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database .
under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon you will find more information about the current piece . see here , how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as his rating .
to view cover images in the context of browser , the cover images are supported in the same folder as the current piece . file formats .@@ jpg , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ gi@@ f and .@@ p@@ n@@ g are preferred . the context browser will also display Cover images that have either been downloaded with the Cover administration or ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
the next section , Recommen@@ ded pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played immediately .
among the recommended pieces there are the favorite pieces of this interpreter . this area shows the five highest rated pieces of the current interpreter .
you can set the information displayed in the music window . click with the right mouse button somewhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu .
the last section , albums of the performer lists all albums of the current interpre@@ ters you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will be folded and you see the content of the album .
you can click on all the pieces in the individual areas to start playing with playback . you can also click on it with the right mouse button and then choose one of the options for adding the piece or album to the playlist .
in the sub@@ window text the downloaded lyrics text is displayed for the running piece . this feature is very flexible and it is possible to download the text for writing scripts . if you click on the text window , try &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; to download the text for the piece from the Internet . if not a text script running , you can choose which is to be started .
the Edit Edi@@ ting allows you to edit the lyrics text . the modified version is then stored in &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok . this is not necessary in a running text script .
the button Find a search for google.com to get to the Li@@ ed@@ text for the current piece ( in an external browser window ) .
group@@ ing interpreter - group@@ ed only the highest level , each piece is displayed directly below the performer . albums or gen@@ res are left out apart .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / album - first , the pieces are arranged according to interpreter and below , another division will be made according to the respective album . if you want to see compositions or sound@@ track albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under different interpre@@ ters .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / year - Album - Sor@@ ted to interpreter and then after the year of album in descending order ( the latest first ) . if the year for an album is unknown , the standard 0 - Alb@@ um@@ name is related .
group album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabe@@ tically by each other . the interpreter will be ignored .
group@@ ing genre / interpreter - your pieces will first appear to the genre , and among them by interpreter .
group@@ ing genre / interpreter - This setting works just like the above , but additionally still is sorted by album below the interpreter .
with the help of the remaining buttons , you can customize and combine the group@@ ing according to exposure .
with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; will your collection automatically detect when you own something on the selected folders . if you own many pieces , this might take a while .
directly under the toolbar can be a search filter . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in construction @-@ view . references to the use of this filter you will find in the section for play@@ lists in this manual .
under the search filter there is a selection panel with which help you can filter the most added pieces to your collection , starting from the last 24 hours up to one year . of course , you can also select your total collection , which makes the filter practically removable .
by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser you receive the following possibilities .
loading - This is the current playlist and adds the selected pieces in the currently valid order into playback .
to playlist - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on one entry you can reach the same effect .
set pieces in queue - This function adds the selected pieces into the queue . this means you will be played next .
as a playlist ... - saves the selected pieces as playlist . you will be asked for a name under which the list should be stored .
on media player - Add the pieces into the queue for transfer to media player . more details can be found in the section on the Media Player browser .
burn all pieces of this interpreter / burn to CD - Dad@@ dies are sent the selected pieces on K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as data or audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option is not displayed .
metadata ( for n pieces ) edit ... - Op@@ ens the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
( n ) Move files in the trash bin ... - Op@@ ens a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
as a compilation - Select the selected album as a compilation , wher@@ eu@@ pon it appears under different interpre@@ ters .
marking marking - a compilation marked album changes back to a normal album . the album is then no longer displayed under different interpre@@ ters , but again under the corresponding interpreter .
the play@@ lists browser creates the handling of many play@@ lists very easy . among other things he also contains Intelligent play@@ lists .
the lower part of the play@@ lists contains the smart play@@ lists . this use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to create some useful play@@ lists at runtime . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection that has never been played .
even even the Intelligent play@@ lists are possible . click on Intelligent playlist to open the dialog to create a new Intelligent playlist . there you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist .
the sub@@ window media player will be used for the connection of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; for example , to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; for example , it must be included before the start of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; when &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok , you will find the pieces on your iPod to performer sorted in the top of the media player browser .
to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the titles from the playlist and drop them on the list of interpre@@ ters . if you are finished , click App@@ ly . therefore , the pieces will be uploaded to your iPod . if the transfer is completed , you finish &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; and solve the drive connection for your iPod .
under the toolbar you can search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders with very many files because in the file list all files are hidden that do not match your search criteria .
in the lower part of the file browser , there is an address bar where you can input music from a entered URL . if you click for example tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musi@@ k.@@ tar@@ .g@@ z enter and input into input , you can draw on music in the file musi@@ k.@@ tar@@ .g@@ z . now you can drag and drop the music from there into the playlist .
if the playlist is longer than in the window is , the depend on files can be difficult . in the case , the pins of the Shift key can be helpful : this automatically inserted files automatically at the end of the list , and not at the mouth position .
the playlist contains all of you attached to the playing pieces . you can change the order by typ@@ ing your entries with the mouse in the desired place . once you enter letters , the characters will be displayed . to reset the filter , you press the back as long as the back @-@ back is empty until the text box is empty again .
if you enter with spaces separate searches , &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; to entries that contain all the search terms . if you enter for example one two three , the search will find all entries that contain one , two and three .
if you enter between the search terms , you will search for entries that either contain either one or the other search term . for example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces will be found , one or two or three ( or a combination of it ) .
if you want to search for entries , the spaces contain , then close the search term with ge@@ aring : Mike Old@@ field . this is how Mike Old@@ field is looking for entries , but not to entries , such as Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a specific search column , you can also look for larger or smaller . for example : rating : &gt; 50@@ th This is looking for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a particular search term , make a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something looks for pieces that do not contain something .
you can combine these syn@@ tactic options according to exposure . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bath . this is searching for all pieces that contain either Mike Old@@ field , or a higher rating than 50 and do not contain the comment .
you can set the play@@ w@@ ron@@ gly set of entries by clicking the C@@ trl key , and then click with the right mouse button in the desired order . the entries will then receive a marking with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces will be reproduced .
the playlist of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist . on the left you find the button adding to which you can add play@@ lists to the right . to the right , you will find playlist , playlist and fe@@ edings M@@ ic .
next follow the buttons back@@ gro@@ wer and restore . so you can make changes to the playlist or restore it .
in the middle of the toolbar , there is a unique , enlarged analy@@ zer . the re@@ fres@@ ch@@ rate can be set with one click of the right mouse button on the Analy@@ zer .
the last button in the toolbar button is menu . it opens the same menu as that you can see in the player window on the right mouse button . over this menu you can set up &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; &apos; s configuration setup .
there are many other available buttons for the toolbar , for example ren@@ e@@ controls and speakers . you can set the buttons by clicking on the menu and select the toolbar button .
the status bar gives you a quick overview of the current piece of information on the playlist . it shows the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the overall play of the current piece . the status for random smo@@ kers and res@@ ump@@ tion is easy to change by clicking the mouse twice in the corresponding display area .
you can also hide the status bar . to view the status bar in general settings .
the context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the Player window , or by clicking on the playlist by clicking on this menu , you can reach the settings of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok .
a click on this entry opens the window visu@@ alisation plug @-@ ins . there you can select the visu@@ al@@ isations of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok .
behind this entry there is a sub@@ menu with link@@ ups to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ;
the Cover administration is a useful tool to manage your Cover images . you can start it by selecting actions cover in the collection browser .
the Cover administration contains a list of all albums in your collection . you can view all albums of an interpreter in your collection by selecting the interpreter on the left .
with the View menu you can choose what to be displayed in the Cover administration . select :
the queue administration received your big entry in &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this function you have even more control over the playlist , appears in the playlist a number next to the title . this number represents the order , in the &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; the pieces will play : 1 is first played , 2 as a second , and so on .
the management of the queue is open to the queu@@ es . if you want to add a piece into the queue , select the piece in the playlist and then click + . you can also use the pieces simply using the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . the order of the pieces can then change in queue .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , of which two are already pre @-@ given ( the details to set up these follow later ) .
fills your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and adds further random pieces during playback .
adds pieces based on last@@ .@@ f@@ m -@@ recommendations ( formerly known : Audi@@ os@@ cro@@ b@@ bler ) . this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist . you do not need load .@@ f@@ m profile to make this dynamic playlist .
click double on the desired playlist , drag it to the playlist window or click with the right mouse button on you and then select charging . in this way , your current playlist will be replaced by the new one . you should save the old play@@ lists under circumstances ! with the
the two pre @-@ issued modes of random mix and play@@ lists fill out immediately your playlist and you can add playback directly . the playlist recommended pieces will start with an empty playlist and you will need to add at least one piece of yourself from your collection . the recommended pieces will be added at the next piece of pieces , so your playlist will be filled only at the end of the first piece .
if you want to keep the current playlist , activate the last possible dynamic mode : settings Dynamic mode . this will use your existing playlist as starting point . using the same menu entry , the dynamic mode can also be disabled again .
the button to fill the current playlist and adds new pieces according to dynamic mode . play@@ lists opens the dialog to edit the playlist and you can change the appropriate settings .
with a right @-@ click on a dynamic playlist , you have the possibility to click on Edit . subsequently , the dialog to edit the settings of the playlist will open .
enter any name for the playlist . however , the name should be unique to avoid confusion .
if this setting is not active , your playlist will continuously grow , the setting for coming pieces will be over@@ taken and they will not hear a piece twice in this playlist . if the adjustment is active , the already played pieces will be played at the consideration of the played songs .
played pieces - this is the number of played pieces which are to be kept in the beginning of the playlist . thus , you can easily see which pieces recently played .
this is the number of pieces that are to be added after each played piece to the playlist . if you set here more than 1 , the playlist will continuously grow , because only one piece is played and removed .
the settings on the right are already described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog you can select from already existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you cross several play@@ lists , &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok will add from each of the crossed play@@ lists .
some scripts allow your own settings . you can customize the settings by clicking the script and then click on Settings .
you can install new &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; scripts install by clicking on the script . after you have installed the script , a new entry in the list will be installed . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet . use the button more scripts .
if you do not want to use a script any longer , you can delete it . select the script from then click D@@ un@@ install .
if you are looking for information on writing your own scripts , please check in writing scripts .
the dialog window visu@@ alisation plug @-@ in is used for activation of the available visu@@ al@@ isations in &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; the window contains a list of all available plugins . to use a plugin , simply enable the cross @-@ box next to the name .
this quick guide will show you how to create audio CD with &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; in four steps to create an audio CD . to drag the steps you need to have a run @-@ run installation of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and a folder with audio files .
this is a dialog window where you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
if you want to burn an audio CD from MP3 s or other los@@ ers compressed formats , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is received , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is created . you can check if an audio CD was created by a los@@ sy format . use the project au@@ CD@@ t@@ ect .
in this dialog box you can do nothing . wait until the computer has completed the burning process .
this quick guide will show you how to copy with &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; a data CD in just four steps to copy the steps you need to have a run @-@ run installation of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and you have added the Qu@@ ell @-@ CD into the CD @-@ Rom .
to copy a data CD , please select extras , CD copy ... from the menu . you can now view a dialog with the possible settings to burning .
once you have made all &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; settings have made , please press the button Start . you now see a dialog that looks like something like this :
in this dialog window , you can follow the progress of the copying . as soon as the reading of the original file is completed , you will be asked for an empty CD @-@ medium to be burned to the data .
&amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you now have to wait until the total step has reached 100 % .
&amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you now have to wait until the total step has reached 100 % .
the Q@@ T Designer tool U@@ IC can not find the &amp; KDE labels . to fix this problem you start q@@ t@@ config and add $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS / lib / K@@ DE@@ 3 / plugins to the search path for libraries ( replace $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS with your base folder of &amp; KDE ; ) .
the website of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; is available at www.@@ k@@ 3@@ b@@ .org . in addition , you will get the latest version of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; also , you can get feedback from the forums and get news from the forums .
if you want to use &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; do you need at least &amp; KDE ; 3.1 and &amp; Q@@ t ; 3.1 .
&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program burns audio or data CD @-@ R@@ s in a run ( even disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a text @-@ like description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ k@@ iso@@ fs ; : burns all kinds of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all functions , which also &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; it offers , and extended these functions even so . therefore , &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; usually automatically &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; however , it automatically reaches &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; however , a higher quality of burned audio CDs .
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program to read digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) . on the Internet such programs are generally referred to as ri@@ pper .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is an entirely open , patented and professional technology for audio encoding and for dealing with audio data streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis benefits from open source and stands in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by the O@@ g@@ g Vor@@ bis De@@ ko@@ der@@ - and en@@ coder modules .
mad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG @-@ audio decoder . he currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Lay@@ er I , Lay@@ er II , and Lay@@ er III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported by the MP3 Decoder module .
l@@ ame : a widely developed MP3 decoder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial en@@ co@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 coder module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source code for fail@@ ing audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio @-@ coder module so you can read FLA@@ C files and write FLA@@ C files .
Li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , FF@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack Decoder : further libraries for the processing of various audio formats . with FF@@ m@@ peg it is possible to de@@ cryp@@ t WMA files to burning them afterwards to an audio CD . de@@ co
So@@ x : an auxiliary program that can go between different audio formats and convert . So@@ x is used by the So@@ x Audio Encoder module .
trans@@ code : a command line program for video review . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ CD@@ Ima@@ ger : a fully equipped car system for editing , dis@@ assemb@@ ling and analy@@ sing video CDs and super video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool is used to fit the volume of music files to a standard level . this can e.g. be useful for creating m@@ apped CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without any norm@@ alize , the different view@@ points of the various albums can lead to the un@@ beautiful effect that will play the music pieces differently noisy .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start recording from CD and automatically re@@ distribute all videos on the basic folder of the CD .
this is a convenient method , recently opened projects again . the associated sub@@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on an entry opens the project .
saves the current project . if the project was already saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it is asked for a new file name .
saves the current project under a new file name . KDE &apos;s dialog save is displayed , with which you can choose folder and fil@@ ename to the project file .
saves all opened projects . this is the same as if you would like to save file for every single project .
includes the current project . if a project changes and has not been saved , asks &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; by what shall happen . you can then choose between saving and changes . besides , you can cancel the closing and keep the project open so .
includes all opened projects . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any not stored project what should be done so , as if you had called for any project file left .
includes all opened projects and finished &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; for every non @-@ stored project will be asked , what should be done with it , as if you had called the file left .
when you access this entry , you can select the same effect as when you enter the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a CD @-@ CD , the files added to the basic folders on the CD .
opens the dialog &quot; Burn &quot; for the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the Properties dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; to burning the medium . the burning dialog can only be opened if the project has already been data .
opens the properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described above the What is that ? help ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry will only appear with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it &apos;s useful when you choose files to the current project . this is useful when you are not using files for a multi @-@ format CD . it is thought for you rather than help , so that you can already see the files and folders on the media .
this entry only appears with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function led &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; to remove files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this function does not remove files from the medium , it bl@@ ends only the previously imported files .
opens the CD @-@ Copy dialog . alternatively , you can also create a copy of a CD on a different medium . alternatively , you can also just create an image of a CD which will then be able to burn then later . also , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of normal copying . you should also prefer cl@@ ones if you want to copy CDs with broken sectors or video CDs .
opens the DVD Copy dialog . alternatively , you can also create a DVD @-@ copying DVD on a different medium . alternatively , you can also only create an image of a DVD with the help of the copying dialogue will not be supported , therefore the target medium must be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source media in the original form .
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ R@@ W . this allows you to delete all content or parts of a CD @-@ R@@ W .
opens the dialog to form@@ atting a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , thus the content is completely deleted . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the writing modes and incre@@ mental .
burns an earlier CD @-@ image . the dialog asks you to a * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as data source , which can then immediately be supported by pressing the burning garlic . ( N@@ eros * .n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burns an earlier DVD @-@ image . the dialog asks you to a * .@@ iso file as data source , which can then be burned down by pressing the burning garlic .
a previously packed DVD video can be converted to you . this dialog window appears usually after reading a DVD in the table , but can also be all@@ ot@@ able . it contains information about the illuminated video , co@@ di@@ er@@ settings and even possibilities for changing the size and cut black edges .
displays information about the subject medium . this information is represented in the table view and contain properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD .
displays a list of the toolbar of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is crossed , the toolbar is currently visible in the main window .
when this is crossed , a small trail is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not crossed , the status bar is hidden .
switches the folder view or off . the folder view contains an overview of your folder and CD / DVD drives . if the table view is activated , their content is displayed in the table view . CD / DVD drives have also a context menu with features such as media info , lock and dis@@ lock of the disk or throwing the medium .
switches the table view or out . the table view allows to select and drag files into the proj@@ ective view . the table view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , provided a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view .
the head@@ line appears in the proj@@ ec@@ ar view or out . the head bar is a nar@@ ro@@ wer area , which contains only visible when the proj@@ ector has no real function , it looks only pretty and separates the proj@@ ect@@ view clearly from the remaining views .
this opens a dialog window to modify key@@ boards for &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; once you chose one of the commands in the upper part , you can customize the order assignment .
this starts the K@@ 3@@ b ; interior super@@ visor . thus , the correct permissions needed to burn CDs and DVDs . for this you need system administrator rights , therefore you must enter the password for the system administrator at the start of the wizard .
opens the settings of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; here general programme can be made . nearly all functions of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; should work on An@@ hi@@ eb . this dialog is intended for person@@ alize and designed for the fine tuning of the program .
&amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; is how many other &amp; KDE ; applications are also equipped with a &amp; D@@ COP ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of functionality may be controlled via a shell script .
to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; functions to use , you can either use the command line program d@@ co@@ p , or the slightly more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the functionality of K@@ d@@ co@@ p . therefore , your taste and the type of your task is decisive in which the con@@ den@@ er programs you give .
in this chapter we assume that you can use the command line program d@@ co@@ p . to make use of the &amp; D@@ COP ; you need to make sure that &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; started . then enter something like the following on the console :
in addition to the general &amp; D@@ COP ; functions that are all &amp; KDE ; program measured , supported &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts which are described below .
the standard D@@ COP @-@ Interface of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; features functions such as copy@@ CD , form@@ at@@ DVD and other functions for generating new projects .
D@@ COP@@ f cre@@ ate@@ aus CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ f cre@@ ate@@ aux DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ f cre@@ ate@@ - DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ re@@ ast Cre@@ ate Video DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) Do@@ er@@ as@@ e@@ C@@ dr@@ w ( ) Com@@ form@@ as@@ e@@ C@@ dr@@ w ( ) Com@@ form@@ at@@ D@@ v@@ d ( ) Differ@@ ences , Bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ ur@@ ur@@ l ) Differ@@ ences ( K@@ ur@@ ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you can create a D@@ COP @-@ reference to the newly created project : # K@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ t@@ d and then a reference to the project received by # d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface , which is only applicable to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
the result of the cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String Name , Q@@ String Par@@ ent ) E@@ add@@ Ur@@ l ( K@@ ur@@ ur@@ l , Q@@ String Par@@ ent ) E@@ ve@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String Path ) Com@@ ren@@ ame@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String Path ) Com@@ ren@@ ame@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String Path , Q@@ string new@@ Name ) A@@ set@@ Vol@@ um@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String Path )
this makes it possible to fill up a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then insert files into the new folder :
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT e@@ co@@ p / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ t@@ xt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ read for &amp; KDE ; . with it you can easily read audio CD ; s read and saved in MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG files . other formats are possible , depending on the en@@ coder installed on the machine .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading from &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on hard disk ) and by many Ko@@ di@@ ers who need to encoding these WAV files ( compressed air compression ) . further co@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first , the title of the &amp; CD are recorded ; stored and stored in WAV files on the machine ( los@@ sy @-@ free and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step these WAV files ( usually one per titles ) compressed into the MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG format or in other formats such as the los@@ s@@ free FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; will be used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must be done now .
for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ vor@@ up ( for O@@ GG ) or other co@@ ders already exist , it is therefore most likely not necessary for any Linux distribu@@ tions , so it is very likely not necessary for any Linux distribu@@ tions that are needed . however , only the encoding packages are needed . if for example Flash C is not used , its installation is also not required .
which Ko@@ di@@ er@@ er- / file format is supposed to use ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ ers gives a small introduction to codi@@ fication , audio quality and compres@@ sing factors .
a word for copying of protected audio CD ; s : as already said , uses &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read the protection , it is not possible to handle any copying audio CD ; if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device can handle the protection , it is not possible to handle a protected audio CD . in any case , &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; even does not avoid the mechanisms of copying protection . simply avoid buying a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; s !
while the setup must be made only once ( the furniture dialog can be called up until a suitable configuration is found ) , after reading a &amp; CD . this leads ( hopefully ) for understanding the slim approach of the UI , which you will often stum@@ ble at the beginning .
can convert into many formats - depending on which encoding programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can collect &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB from the internet or can work completely without network , whereby everything is detected manually .
this is only a brief list of the commands of the main window . on the page step by step example you will find further information on how this program is used as well as screen pictures with descriptions of the tab@@ s for the configuration of the program .
starting the CD@@ DB request of the CD @-@ data according to the establishment of inquiry in the CD@@ DB tab ( this can be locally or online , in latter case the connection must be made up to the Internet . )
&quot; &quot; &quot; start reading and - if a Encoder has been configured in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tab &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tab in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Configuration Settings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tab . &quot; &quot; &quot;
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available Encoder , so that the selection can be read with another en@@ coder using the default . it is to note that previously the en@@ coder is configured in the dialog box in the dialog box .
opens the file manager , so that an already illuminated file is selected instead of a complete &amp; CD ; read and encoding .
opens the furniture dialog for the type of noti@@ fications ( such as protocols , pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for program events ( such as read the &amp; CD ; completed ) .
opens the main@@ tainer dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different cards ( such as en@@ coder , to insert the En@@ co@@ ders ) . you need to go before the program can be successfully used !
this chapter describes sound quality , encoding and compres@@ sing rates and helps you choose the right codi@@ le .
if no audio information is to go lost , a los@@ s@@ free audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C , there are also other such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may possibly be available for this distribution . the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can reproduce these files .
among the audio formats you lose information through data compressed according to their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit@@ rate , the differences are less important since both Ko@@ di@@ ers produce very good audio quality .
o &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , l@@ ame will nevertheless be supplied free with most distribu@@ tions , but there are open license questions
+ high to very high clay quality ( with high bit@@ rates ) but compared to O@@ GG slightly deeper quality in low bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or a host based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG devices are available .
MP3 - when music should also be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special car @-@ stereo . today - beginning 2009 - support these devices mostly only the MP3 format .
a short list of parameters for audio quality and the resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; --@@ pres@@ et medium &quot; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = this setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most of the tunes , and has quite high quality . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo system with high quality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compres@@ sive rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ B 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate approximately 5.5 . needs always 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo system with high quality .
&apos; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR joint stereo , compression rate about 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good gen@@ ug for music of young people , portable devices and auto@@ cl@@ ere@@ o@@ facilities . but not good enough for better Hi@@ Fi stereo .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et Ins@@ ane &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting is exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have the absolutely highest quality without regard to file size , then select this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information provided manually or through the program automatically from the free@@ DB via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / used with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the encoding program to create the folder and file name as well as the properties of music files .
in connection with codi@@ fication programs , there is often a combination of programs for the codi@@ fication and these parameters here . the manual or the help with the co@@ ders explain the switches for these programs .
e.g. to add the &amp; CD ; title to the keywords ( English : tag ) if MP@@ 3@@ s are co@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switches must be added by l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button @-@ drawing in assistant ) :
this is what the free@@ DB is : a free database where people can download the audio CDs to enter the information instead of yourself into the computer . it is to note that here only from text is said : &amp; CD ; titles , artist , names of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( an@@ m of the U@@ eber@@ ries ) is not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent that you may cause any damage from the &amp; CD ; and there is also the information without the &amp; CD ; more or less valuable , so may neither the artist nor the music can cause damage . all information can occur in any bum@@ ble@@ bee by a &amp; CD ; shop , physical or virtu@@ oso .
in &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; is actively a cross @-@ cross ( send an address ) . in this type of configuration , it appears , the e @-@ mail address is not used when retri@@ eving the data from the server ( This may only know the programmer who has checked the code ) .
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; used to use Free@@ DB , the geo@@ graphically should be used on the next lying mirror server . this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between machines .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirrors for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information while reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually month ) only the updates of the database .
which reading program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; save in WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to know more exactly , search in source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; see that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package has to be installed first at first if this has not yet happened .
to save the full WAV files the encoding and the desired file format may be chosen . at first opening there are pre @-@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a los@@ s@@ free compression for audio data ) on the tab for inser@@ tion of the encoding . other Ko@@ di@@ ers can be added on this tab .
the codi@@ le package must be installed from the respective Linux distribution before the encoding . this is necessary for pre@@ defined co@@ aster . more information about co@@ di@@ ers are in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ ers .
after installing a codi@@ le you can get more information about his switches through the input of a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) .
this can have many causes . check the setup of the device drawing of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drives on it and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio encoding of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) . try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal . that could give a hint about what is wrong .
check if you do not want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the envelope of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips on how to proceed .
did you read the complete manual , but are somehow still uns@@ ure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , read everything and our first &amp; CD . we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; use MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 keywords ( tags ) .
it must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found for example using a search engine , since it is considered not completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can naturally always do .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd / cd / cd / cd / cd / cd / cd / cd / cd / cd ( eg ; by trying to copy it with the con@@ quer@@ or ) .
the first section covers the basic set of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; something that probably is done once and
the second section describes how to read a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for each edition &amp; CD .
here we determine the enco@@ ded co@@ ders for the compression of music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) . as we are lazy , we share the program to use the free@@ DB to download the &amp; CD ; data from the Internet to download .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will most likely not be able to read any of a &amp; CD if the matching settings are found .
the device @-@ drawing is transferred to the read @-@ out program to read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces can be read .
frequently / dev / c@@ drom a symbolic link to the actual device @-@ drawing of your drive . if this does not work or if more than a &amp; CD ; / DVD Drive can be accessed , so a look at the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device design@@ ations for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the map card General settings . here gi@@ b@@ ts do not have much to do . here an additional transformation may be defined . in our example everything will be as bel@@ ated / typ@@ ed as shown in the scre@@ enshot .
only when un@@ complete information can be retri@@ eved , so that you will be informed when indications are missing from keywords ( tags ) .
the map card CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and allow the &amp; CD ; data automatically download the Internet from a free@@ DB calculator .
note : the calculator must be connected to the Internet while reading the &amp; CD , so that it can access the free@@ DB server .
the second selection field is easier , becomes a &amp; CD ; entry found , begins immediately the reading of the &amp; CD ; which is dis@@ satisfied with the database name and the default directory name / fil@@ ename or fil@@ ename , they can easily be altered using the directory entry and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; KDE ; Tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , it is further to note : if you want to manually enter the selection fields and free@@ DB will not be used . however , this over 6@@ 20 MB will not be used . however , you can use the database previously . however , this is worth 6@@ 20 MB to use , the two choices must be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following map card .
CD@@ DB is for us free@@ DB . these are settings for data inquiry , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB server via the Internet . how do the system know which data will be given to the CD ? read the section about free@@ DB . put everything as it pic@@ tured in the scre@@ enshot .
mode : we have not downloaded the database , we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB @-@ Server : please go to the page fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server in your area . on this way the load is distributed among the machines . however , this setting will work as first attempt .
both function as equivalent to the server , there are many fire@@ walls the protocol 8@@ 80 default , maybe more luck with the protocol 80 , since the &amp; HTTP ; protocol is usually open to surf the Internet .
in this example we do not want to submit a &amp; CD ; data to the free@@ DB server should de@@ activate the first bond field .
just take the settings of the screen shot . ( make sure that the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
number at the same pieces : sorry , there is a reason why more than one at the same time with just an existing drive ? parall@@ el@@ Read and encoding ? the author doesn &apos;t know , therefore simply try ourselves .
CD : after reading the last piece : follow this to cast this to the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process .
user @-@ defined folder for temporary files : if you are going to cross the path / folder in which the WAV files can be stored . this can not be useful if only space on another drive is created . do not forget the folder in the private folder . forget that folder if you want to make something with the WAV files .
everything you enter as it is on the screen shot . the command is a bit long , under circumstances something must be sha@@ ken to the right .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , this is an adjustment for very good audio quality , even for very good Hi@@ Fi stereo . the resulting bit@@ rate is average about 224 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the achieved compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the limitation of the production of tags at version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags can also be deleted . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; ID@@ 3 &apos; Tag@@ ger for &amp; KDE ; in the case of later change the tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the complete path ) and the output file ( including the complete path ) .
put the rest as in the scre@@ enshot . some comments for future use outside of this example :
number of simultaneously to codi@@ fying WAV files : with a dual core or quad@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine , you can encoding more than a WAV file at the same time .
this is because we have just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; this configuration is used as standard for each read of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music , you will never need to change them again .
in this section describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD . we will create MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard drive , as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from the free@@ DB would like to be described in this section , it must be repeated for each edition &amp; CD .
as we use a &amp; CD , which is not yet included in free@@ DB , see the Screen photos a little different from the data for a &amp; CD ; therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually to enter instead of sending it from the internet . comments will refer to the differences .
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example will be found . it is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this hand@@ book .
if this is not yet done so now the &amp; CD must be defined in the drive , which was defined in the main window .
after a short moment the pieces and its length should be listed in the window , as in the scre@@ enshot . this only if the &amp; CD ; as an audio CD ; be identified and can be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this does not happen then you are looking for questions and answers following the help or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD was done successfully from the free@@ DB , all titles of the pieces are already completed and the name of the artist and album are displayed .
in the event that there is more than an entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; the key for your &amp; CD ; there will be a window appears , and you can select the database entry containing your opinion best to your &amp; CD .
if you do not have the cross @-@ box for automatic query of free@@ DB ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in dialog for settings ) , you can also manually trigger this by choosing the first button in the toolbar . if you do not have local database , you need the connection to the Internet .
e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD @-@ editor - entering the CD @-@ data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen photo . the title of the piece in the first row of the &apos; actu@@ ator title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; album &apos; .
the artist must no longer be entered in the input field &apos; actu@@ eller title &apos; unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece .
the lower commentary box can be used for the individual comments ini@@ di@@ aly@@ ell per piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply together for all the pieces of the CD .
attention : after successful retri@@ eval of data from the free@@ DB is not empty , but it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor , so that you can not only start with the artist and album name ( e.g. whether all words with big letters begin or not ... ) but also to check if there are any unwanted remarks .
note : in this example we use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limit the length of fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the comment range . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags , you have set up unlimited field @-@ length , at least on what &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; maximum permits . this option is set on the tab button in the Settings tab .
you can change the tag of the generated files later at any time with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can create ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders or file formats . see in the help of the encoding to obtain more information .
simply select an entry that is obvious with the style of the pre@@ fix CD . in this example this is not important as we don &apos;t transmit the &amp; CD . for further information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or R@@ ap for example are to be found under Rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; come back to the main window . click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD editor will be released again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data that we have recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . the title of the piece is definitely the case and other information you wish .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD .
attention : this window doesn &apos;t appear if you have downloaded the data from the free@@ DB . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the toolbar . note that the artist and the album are displayed above the piece @-@ list .
note that there &apos;s a check @-@ sign in front of each line of a piece . only the titles that are marked are selected . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece or out . make sure that all pieces select the piece or select the button all pieces select at the bottom of the screen to pick all the pieces at once .
was started by clicking on the button to read the reading process , this window appears to confirm confirmation . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what is happening .
click on the tab for switching on the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the toolbar .
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is currently read on the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the lower lower part of the window in the status bar .
this error message can be seen if you are trying to work with a codi@@ le that you have not yet installed . pieces which were not successfully co@@ ded with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder to the tmp file and the target folder are not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked if you have a write access to the folder for temporary files and target folders ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of the reading of the first piece .
the job 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the co@@ ding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . so take reading and encoding parallel . take note of the status message in the lower part of the window , it &apos;s now improved .
the author of the programmer has found no configuration settings to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing can be configur@@ able , the number of parallel processes for reading and encoding . on high @-@ performance machines the result is unclear . the computer used with an AM@@ D@@ 64 appears to have no problem with simultaneous reading and encoding ( from however , two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read , while another piece is co@@ ded and a third order is co@@ ded into the queue of the Ko@@ di@@ fier . after the last piece is co@@ ded , a small window with a message appears for a short time in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; you need &amp; KDE ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to generate compressed audio files such as MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the codi@@ fication of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is now available within the &amp; KDE ; CV@@ S is as part of the k@@ m@@ oto media package . however , most distribu@@ tions have already included a pre @-@ compiled package , da &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; a part of an important &amp; KDE bundle . if you read this , you probably have already done it ...
this section is directed to individuals that compile from source files , and not for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are searching for help as the program can be adapted to your needs , the following is correct for you :
a program that calls many different other programs , has many variations of settings . best you can read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it displays screen pictures of the different cards of settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example .
hello , still alive ? even if only the help menu was clicked after the first time of the program , without any clu@@ e as it is to go on from this sort of empty screen ( especially if at the time of the program starts no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it ? who reads this has probably already started the program . it should somehow look like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author can not maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; whoever wants to do something or change it . at least just after contacting the author . and if you read this , he did leave this section and therefore agree with this suggestion .
strange when we succeeded is the source file from the &amp; KDE ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these inform@@ atics but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kar@@ ao@@ ke gam@@ er from &amp; KDE ; in addition to others he did not have a real @-@ time graphic and kar@@ ao@@ ke @-@ real @-@ record high@@ lighting of texts also some attributes , the other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS - and &amp; KDE ; support also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ yn@@ x project drivers , which is required for CIS cards . AL@@ SA is included as soon as it supports a sequence .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics text on the screen with changing color , so it is easy to follow the piece .
graphic representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressing buttons on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you can go in &amp; KDE ; any MIDI file from one &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; window on K@@ Mid drop .
supports the two existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( songs or text events ) . K@@ mid automatically determines the procedure used .
seat support . if you end &amp; KDE ; during the playing of a song end , K@@ mid will start again with the same song again .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , A@@ we , FM and CIS cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P Driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can open air ... from the menu file . it appears the usual file dialog with which help you select the desired song .
you can also drop a file from one &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; window will drop . this also works with multiple songs simultaneously .
to play a piece of music , open it and hit the button playing in the toolbar , select the entry off from the menu item or bet@@ s the spac@@ eb@@ ar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts as soon as you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; you will be added to a collection and then played in each other . )
once &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece plays , you can jump in any place by using the middle mouse button and drive with the controller .
if you find that song will be played too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows left and right of the tem@@ po@@ display and so change the playback speed . to get the original speed , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the spac@@ eb@@ ar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the button or the selecting the menu entry into the menu piece , i.e. the playback . if you play the spac@@ eb@@ ar while no piece is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; the playback .
lyrics can be saved on two types in a piece of music . some pieces use text allow@@ ance , others use Li@@ ed@@ t@@ external , and again others . some pieces have no text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set out which events are to be presented and even better : the event sty@@ p is automatically chosen to activate a song so you don &apos;t have to adjust the automatic text text . you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other type .
if you want to set a particle type set , select from the menu settings the entries text or property events . the same function also have the keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files which summar@@ ize you . these are play@@ able in this section as you can use collections efficiently .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find this menu collection under the point Organ@@ ize .... Click there to New and enter the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection will include the same songs as the original one .
if you have more than one collection , you can set the threads in the collection manager .
in the temporary collection all the songs you want to add to any other collection .
when you leave the application , this collection will not be stored . concerns you when you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must add a song in the collector manager . there , you can add a song with the button adding . it appears in turn the file dialog with which help you select the desired song .
a second method to add a song depends on setting automatic adding to the collection .
when automatic adding is enabled for collection , a piece of opening ( using file opening or drag &amp; drop ) automatically added to the active collection .
when Autom@@ atically add to the collection is not activated , when opening a piece the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied . this collection will then be added to the further open pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click R@@ emo@@ ve .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the row according to the menu item menu , the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection .
when you add songs or select songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined .
to play a song , select it in the collector manager , or use the selection list via the kar@@ ao@@ ke text .
to jump on a song , select the button next song , the entry next song from the menu item or push the left arrow to the right .
in order to jump back a song , select the button previous piece , the item previous piece from the menu item or push the left arrow to the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection and click on the button Del@@ ete .
the temporary collection can not be deleted . however , this does not play a role as it is saved at the aband@@ on@@ ment of &amp; k@@ mid ; not saved .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thesizer that are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI map is translated general @-@ MIDI events in events that syn@@ thesizer the syn@@ thesizer .
for example , you can create a MIDI map , which trans@@ forms all events of the type Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the Type D patch to Tru@@ mp@@ et and thus always sound a trumpet if originally a piano should play .
if you only have a sound card , you don &apos;t need any MIDI map , because all sound cards are GM -@@ compatible ( incl. A@@ we - and CIS cards , FM radio devices and so on ) .
unfortunately , there is no programs to create MIDI @-@ maps . you need to edit the appropriate file from hand ( with your favourite editor ) .
a MIDI @-@ map is a text file that stores all required re@@ aliz@@ ations for playing a piece .
each section may only appear once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MAP section , which may appear as often as desired . for this is , however , that each occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) .
De@@ fine PA@@ T@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MAP &quot; A further Key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D De@@ fine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Options ... EN@@ D
you see that De@@ fine is needed to indicate that a section begins ( except for Options ) and EN@@ D that the end of a paragraph is achieved .
please send me your map file as an e @-@ mail so I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can be used for devices that are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ compatible .
in this section the patches of General MIDI on your specific keyboard is shown . the general use looks as follows :
please note that the left side of the Equ@@ al sign is ignored . it is assumed that GM -@@ patches are written in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order and also leave no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ key@@ s@@ To M is needed to put all notes on the sound with the number M . if your keyboard , for example does not support a gun kiss ( GM @-@ patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with clay 60 ) , which is similar to a gun shot . do you wear the following in the PA@@ T@@ CH@@ MAP section :
so when a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with Patch 127 ( tissue ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , irrespective of which sound in the MIDI file is .
please note that here with the term drum patch of the patch is meant to be a different perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ing instrument ( drum , pel@@ vis , Marac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one where the tone also means the tone @-@ height of the ever same drum ( like some key@@ boards ) .
the KE@@ Y@@ MAP section is needed to indicate how sounds are shown on a certain channel or instrument . the use is :
as with the PA@@ T@@ CH@@ MAP section , the order of lines is very important , as their presence . you need to create 128 entries .
you can define several keywords for each channel and each instrument . you just have to use different names in the first line .
key@@ note will be used primarily to form tones on the Perl channel . look at the supplied key@@ note as an example .
this section can be used to form some channels on others . if you want to change the first and second channel , you can easily make this in CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards which have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI to Channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) .
Midi devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , according to the following pattern :
n is the channel , which is pic@@ tured on the channel . if you use the Key@@ map option , the key@@ map must be defined in the file name . if you are using the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored that will change the patch on this channel . in this case , the patch will then always be used patch .
the For@@ ce@@ patch option can be useful for example to always use the per@@ l @-@ patch on the Perl @-@ channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ ben@@ der@@ Ratio will be in which relationship Pit@@ ch @-@ ben@@ der events will be multiplied . if a MIDI file sends a pitch @-@ list with the value n , this is used with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then only passed . the value 40@@ 96 is used , so that in the map file does not stand dec@@ imal combinations ) .
this setting is needed because GM gives that a keyboard , which is a pitch @-@ ben@@ der event with the value 40@@ 96 to play a sound higher . unfortunately , however , try to play some key@@ boards up to one oc@@ tave higher . to try the correct value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid .
to use a MIDI map , simply open the dialog MIDI settings . you will find them in the menu under Settings , point MIDI settings
the can@@ al@@ view is a window with a whole series of cl@@ vi@@ als ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these pi@@ vi@@ als you see which tones are straight .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel . for each channel there is a selection list where you can choose an instrument , the button no longer green but red , to indicate that no longer is used the original instrument .
the kan@@ al@@ view has ( until now ) two different views to indicate the played tones . view in the menu settings below the Point channel view : settings
the speed LCD displays the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the pace of a song . so if you find e.g. , a song is too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the pace , use the arrows left and right of the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a piece of music has to be played . it contains the notes , the rhythm , the speed , &amp; etc . it can result in the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results , just as two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way .
good , I can comp@@ el anybody , &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression mode ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you can also change the individual instruments , the speed &amp; etc . you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) of &amp; k@@ mid ; that happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without A@@ we support has been compiled . to remove the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example of k@@ mid ; &apos; s )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually .
dis@@ agrees to support &amp; k@@ mid ; Drag &amp; Drop . open the folder you want to add in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; select all the files and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window .
you absolutely activate the setting of automatic adding to the collection . otherwise the files are added to a temporary collection .
you can watch the arrow key on the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD control to slow the playback . to restore the standard temp@@ o you can double click on the LCD double .
I have a &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I play a kar@@ ao@@ ke file ) or attached ( if I want to cancel a kar@@ ao@@ ke file ) or I want to cancel a file , just switch to the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; window switch and the desired file to the window of &amp; k@@ mid ; drag .
if you just want to listen to a file without adding a file , turn off the setting of automatic adding to the collection , and the new ; file is added to temporary collection . opening files
suppose that , you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ A.@@ D. First you just want to cancel the first file . so , set off automatic adding to the collection and open A.@@ mi@@ d. its temporary collection then contains exactly this a MIDI file .
then you choose to play also B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid to play and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people have sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . congratulations to all the many thanks ! if I hear these songs or view the postcard , anim@@ ates me to program on &amp; k@@ mid ; to program .

my thanks also applies Jose L@@ us San@@ chez for the testing of the CIS support , Marc Di@@ it@@ d@@ son , Marc Di@@ it@@ ch , Magn@@ us L@@ usa , Magn@@ us L@@ usa , Magn@@ us L@@ usa , Magn@@ us L@@ usa , Magn@@ us L@@ usa , Mr. Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , a troubles@@ hooting or even just a suppor@@ tive e @-@ mail .
and of course , my thanks also applies to all these outstanding musicians on the net , which give us this wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ ao@@ ke files .
additionally this can be found &amp; k@@ mid ; also available on his homepage , which is under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .@@ html pages . on the homepage you can track the development , information look and images . you will also find links to pages with other kar@@ ao@@ ke songs , &amp; etc .
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer because the sound quality depends on your sound card . it is not the same if you use a FM radio device or an A@@ we card .
if you do not have sound card , you need to compile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL , it works as if you would like to have a sound card unless you can of course listen to music .
if trouble will occur , please contact one of the &amp; KDE mailing lists or send an error message directly to me .
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is a simple interface for M@@ players , ph@@ ono and FF@@ M@@ peg . the program will be used to play Video Files from M@@ Player or Ph@@ on@@ on supported formats , as well as playback DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera .

the use window is formed from so called and@@ able windows . alternatively , there is always the window with the central view . alternatively , there is the window with the playlist . and finally there is a information window that will only be displayed when information is displayed in it .
it is possible to adjust the favorite connections under the book@@ marks menu , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are play@@ able to each other , you should use the category of thum@@ bs playlist .
of course , you can add groups to groups to receive an additional hierarchy . if you pop an entry , his group and all its sub @-@ groups are copied to the current category and playback begins with the attached entry .
the categories &apos; updated piece &apos; , TV and perman@@ ence play@@ lists can also be changed by an editor , but also by applying itself . simply on a name of a category cli@@ cks to choose from the menu View and next editing mode . by clicking a sub@@ group , only the XML content of this part is displayed .
after changing XML files , you have to select the same with play@@ lists from the menu and select either the work@@ load mode , or selected a different category .
all changes will be lost if the job mode leave or another group will be selected without the playlist .
due to the convenience of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player , some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files .
the animation at start@@ up and respon@@ ds can be disabled by the editing of ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c and Change from &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ iger option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can be easily inserted .
it is also possible to enable other animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / intro@@ .@@ x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / etc / k@@ m@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .@@ x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation at start@@ up does not need to be short , it will automatically terminate through opening another source . this would be dis@@ rup@@ tive at the end @-@ animation , the user can therefore end the application a second time .
a simple example of a start @-@ animation can be the ads of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; s ; ye@@ e = / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f ; / lt ; / sm@@ iles ; / lt ; / sm@@ il@@ ted ; / lt ; / sm@@ il@@ ted ; / lt ; / sm@@ il@@ ted ; / lt ; / sm@@ il@@ ted ; / s ; / sm@@ il@@ ted ; / s ; / sm@@ il@@ ted ; / s ; / sm@@ il@@ ted ; / s ; / sm@@ il@@ ted ; / s ; / sm@@ il@@ ted ; / s ; / s ; / lt ; / s ; / s ; / s ; / s ; / s ; / s ; / s ; / s ; / s ; / s ; / s ; / s ; / s ; / s ; / s ; / s ; / s ; / s ; / s ; / s ) are supported by S@@ MI@@ L that are supported by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ;
there is a rider on the configuration of M@@ players in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; here , the path from the M@@ Player and the intermediate storage size of the data stream from the network and other things can be set .
another tool for troubles@@ hooting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the toolbar of k@@ m@@ player . here is the output of m@@ player visi@@ bly .
there is no rider for this playback device in the configuration dialog by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; all must be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ w@@ c . here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; with the module sw@@ f@@ de@@ c @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa is played :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; it can even be inserted the special field Emb@@ ed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
to play the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages must re@@ play , the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; module as a service provider for the MI@@ ME type A / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the furniture dialog file names of KDE can be specified .
the con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; k@@ player ; is available in a consoles application and search the error regarding the loading of the browser module library . if there is no error messages , the back@@ end issue is within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
thus getting a given back@@ end for a particular MI@@ ME type ( of course only if this was also determined ) , this must be done by manual change of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ w@@ c . for example , phon@@ on should reproduce all og@@ g files :
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can play from TV maps , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this need k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be used , the scanner is used from the configuration dialog , or the configuration file can be manually edited .
for configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( video data recorder ) settings in the k@@ player is the dialog in the settings below - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; X@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port to use . where to use ports , it must be found out ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a DV@@ B in it .
since the V@@ DR can use k@@ m@@ player only X@@ Video , should X@@ Video also work ( pres@@ um@@ ably , this type of playback of video equipment under Linux will be the only work ) . this is also required only on the first screen ( : 0.0 ) . this is also required only on the first screen ( : 0.0 ) . this is also required to include the X@@ Free@@ 86 server in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) .
internally , from KM@@ Player to the sources are used for different names . at the time of the formation of these documentation , this will be dv@@ d source , source source , pi@@ p@@ es@@ our@@ ce , t@@ v@@ scanner , source source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . if they are activated , they begin with the playback of the playlist .
are there hints how I can make my CD@@ ROM drive if I play from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the HD@@ PAR@@ M -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is run as a user root after inser@@ ting the device . it is absolutely certain that / dev / c@@ drom on the CD@@ ROM drive shows .
X@@ ine only starts slowly , why must each time be checked my CPU to its performance ?
note : the answer is over@@ hau@@ l k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the last saved value , only the first time x@@ ins will check the CPU .

l@@ atex ; : a professional fonts application . under Unix @-@ like systems will probably be picked up on the package &amp; tex@@ as ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the &amp; Linux distribution . for installation , the documentation should be included in distribution or installation CD ; / DVD disc .
the &amp; ki@@ le ; project includes some already compiled packages of &amp; ki@@ le ; for various distribu@@ tions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the ki@@ le ; website included .
this hand@@ book is for everyone - independent of the experiences with &amp; l@@ atex ; , &amp; KDE ; , &amp; ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ;
advanced users need to hardly read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation must be taken into account . however , the support for this project or its documentation should be made , the contact over the ki@@ le ; web page should be established .
if you have any questions or if the comp@@ iling of &amp; ki@@ le ; on or are desired extensions , this should be addressed on the mailing list of ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; l@@ atex ; environment for the &amp; KDE ; -@@ desktop . also offers &amp; ki@@ le ; the possibility to use all &amp; l@@ atex ; functions in a graphical interface and within these a simple , immediate and tailor @-@ made access to all . finally , the easy to use assistant , the &amp; l@@ atex ; reference and the powerful project management .
to learn more about &amp; K@@ ate ; and his opportunities to learn should the manual be attracted to K@@ ate . users of &amp; ki@@ le ; can begin there directly with reading the chapter , work with the editor of &amp; K@@ ate ; begin .

looking here only a good review to &amp; l@@ atex ; it is not the ultimate book on this . to allow &amp; l@@ atex ; properly dominate , A Guide to &amp; l@@ atex ; : Document Pre@@ par@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 d@@ af@@ r .
just as other graphic languages includes &amp; l@@ atex ; an introduction , with which the most common properties like paper format , page number@@ ing and text size can be defined as well as a kiss with the text . the introduction includes at least the command \ \ \ Docum@@ em@@ ony with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ by { document } .
the quick@@ ening assistant of &amp; ki@@ le ; is a multi @-@ faceted function for the fast creation of a document in &amp; ki@@ le ; the selection of the assistant ( Men@@ Ã ¼ ) provides some possibilities for the creation of the document . it enables you to create some of the settings related to the document .
document classes : hereby the type of document applies : article ( article ) , book &#91; report &#93; , book &#91; report &#93; , report &#91; report &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; Kol@@ art@@ cl &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; re@@ book &#93; , proj@@ ector , or custom .
co@@ ding : hereby the character co@@ ding is set . modern systems are increasingly using the UT@@ F @-@ 8 -@@ co@@ ding as standard . best , UT@@ F @-@ 8@@ x should be used ( for correct processing of &amp; l@@ atex ; documents ) .
this list includes the most used additional packages for &amp; l@@ atex ; for the incorpor@@ ation they can only be hal@@ ted in the cross field .
article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the documentation classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) .
new users do not have to worry about . it is a short description of the functions and further information on this subject are given in the section .
&amp; ki@@ le ; offers - just as other source code editors - the high@@ lighting of the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . through &amp; ki@@ le ; it is a simple problem looking for that any mathematical environment is not closed . you hate it through the modest appearance of the output file nevertheless . however , you will save you through the high@@ lighting time and time .
with automatic wiring of the environments , when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) of &amp; ki@@ le ; automatically a blank line ( to input the text ) and the added line to the Sch@@ lie@@ uten@@ ant of the command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be de@@ activated in the menu settings ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X commands .
all documents are normally divided into some elements . &amp; l@@ atex ; the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the most beautiful and sub@@ trac@@ ed the lowest element ) :
when viewing the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by one click of the mouse .
in creating your own &amp; l@@ atex ; files can be very helpful in creating your own &amp; l@@ atex ; as soon as a DVI ; file &#91; framed file ( eng@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ oses File ) &#93; was created , jumps &amp; ki@@ le ; by a click with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; viewer for the corresponding line in the &amp; l@@ atex ; source code .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the form@@ atted document and also other information such as font ; or &amp; l@@ atex ; . there are many tools for viewing , conversion and printing of DVI ; files for different systems and upri@@ ghts .
when using the edges are the elements of the DVI ; file is clicked with the editor and once on an element in the DVI ; file clicked on is the exact opposite of it . once upon a section in the &amp; l@@ atex ; source code was clicked , becomes the corresponding point in the DVI ; observer sc@@ anned .
Master &apos;s document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a Master document the work is simplified with other em@@ tex files . when using a project a project @-@ wide master document can be set on project preferences .
fast construction : the &amp; l@@ atex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if no error in the source code ) .
file ann@@ u@@ ation : in this mode , the DVI ; file on the course of course , the DVI , and there is not a call of &amp; oc@@ ular ; according to the rapid construction .
when considering the editing toolbar . the selection fields were developed for fast inser@@ tion of common elements into the document . the first selection field is intended for quick shut@@ down of the document into parts , chapters , sections , ... The ver@@ able &amp; l@@ atex ; statements for the sub@@ division are :
the selection field more is available for example of articles such as keywords , fu@@ cking notes or references . the publishers are :
name : with this command a name for a section , an image or different element is created .
cover : is used for reference to a fixed name ( selection of a selection ) .
when using quotation , a selection list is displayed with literary entry . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files are appropriate editors necessary . the author has good experience with &amp; k@@ b@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; and the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can be made by hand also in &amp; ki@@ le ; by hand .
the last drop field with the name of Gr@@ Ã ¼ e will be used for defining the font . it enables the font for the main text , the fox , etc . etc . there are the following fonts for disposal :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when calling &amp; ki@@ le , two choices are available : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document font and fixed settings . 2 . the document can be written from scratch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the brack@@ ets after the command \ \ Docum@@ em@@ ony contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; sets the font . if the let@@ ter@@ ment is not specified at the beginning , this can also be done in text .
once the above source code was entered the &amp; l@@ atex ; source code has to be compiled . the easiest way to this is the use of the menu or the button of the button .
the source code must be stored before the comp@@ iling . &amp; ki@@ le ; for storage , the storage is automatically saved .
conclusions the comp@@ iling of the document was missing , should be searched in the logging after the errors . when using quick@@ set should be started . if this is not the case , the logging should be observed .
an environment ( English . environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the fonts have been created . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ end { environment } , then the course of let@@ tering from the let@@ tering can be found within the area .
the inspection will only be cau@@ tious only within the area ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no description ( number ) for transport within an environment .
there are many possibilities for enligh@@ tening the read@@ ability and usability of the document . for example , certain fonts , fat pressure , sub@@ sist@@ ence , sub@@ missions , etc. are added to either with the command \ \ , or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the course of course and is long as long until he is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a sentence can be represented with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ rate : creates a quotation in the document . the quotation begins with \ \ begin { rate } and ends with \ \ end { rate } .
after the background to write the source code with the &amp; l@@ atex ; pron@@ unci@@ ation language , follows is now a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; ki@@ le ;
once the wizard was typ@@ ed a bit of text , a few adjustments should be done for the better read@@ ability of the document . for this , a quotation , a few places in the fat and cur@@ sing pressure and a poem are to be seen in order to see the differences of these commands .
once the document was viewed , using Editor @-@ View or C@@ trl E again ( with the internal viewer ) . with an external viewer , its window must be closed .
once the DVI ; file was created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script file . simply try and Spa@@ ak .
DVI ; is a long @-@ term file format ( eng@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ oses ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; l@@ atex ; for read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer , there are many different types of the .d@@ vi output like printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conver@@ ters or computer imaging .
for printing a &amp; DVI ; file are the same steps as for the creation of the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - then the document can be printed by file prints ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is set properly ) .
the toolbar button is the conversion of the DVI ; file in other formats . as soon as the DVI ; file from the &amp; l@@ atex ; source code was created , the conversion can be used by using the kno@@ ck in the toolbar .
the pre @-@ looking for the direct leap from the editor to the associated position within the DVI ; -@@ file .
&amp; ki@@ le ; provides a corresponding setting for all &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ bin@@ ds files . this only needs to set Modern under Settings Ki@@ le ... tools of the building .
in order to check prices , the mouse @-@ cursor must be positioned in a line of source code and slept on preference . the jump to the corresponding position in the DVI ; viewers will then take place .
with this function in &amp; oc@@ ular : with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; l@@ atex ; document of &amp; ki@@ le ; indicated and available for the corresponding line ; a text editor must be specified ( settings Ok@@ ular set up ... Editor )
should in case of removal of the &amp; DVI ; viewers do not agree , an error may appear . if an error appears , this is displayed in the log file or in the news window in summary .
the log file will cause the error source in the source code . in the editor you can see the kno@@ bs Typ@@ ing La@@ Te@@ X error and N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ ster La@@ Te@@ X error and matches the error on the error , must be clicked on the error in the logging line and &amp; ki@@ le ; jumps to the faul@@ ty line .
once on the corresponding button in the toolbar button is clicked , a window appears to choose the template for the document . the features presented here are :
for selecting empty document , a document can be written either from scratch or the wizard for quick creation of a new document . more information can be included in the section .
mo@@ tive user of &amp; l@@ atex ; usually use the same introduction for virtually all documents . assists in &amp; ki@@ le ; created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex must be created or created a new file . &amp; ki@@ le ; can create a new template using an existing document and selection of file template from document ... create a new template .
when creating a new document from a template using a file , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character co@@ ding ) . these variables can be set up in Settings Ki@@ le ... Settings can be set .
when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings from which variables are replaced :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ ME@@ NT@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TIO@@ NS $ $ : this string will be replaced by entering into document class . typically , it is used as follows : \ \ Docum@@ ent@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ ME@@ NT@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TIO@@ NS $ $ &#93; { article } .
the easiest way to create a template is the use of the wizard , and the forwarding of the commands in the editor . once the document was created in this way , the following steps have been accomplished :
when creating a new document then you can create your own template instead of the default size .
a template can be created from any &amp; l@@ atex ; a simple way to create a template , should be sought after one on the internet and were introduced under the steps described below .
&amp; ki@@ le ; used &amp; K@@ ate ; as an internal editor . &amp; K@@ ate ; is a text editor for programmers with the possibilities of reading and vibr@@ ating from many different types of text files ( including &amp; l@@ atex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for &amp; K@@ ate ; enables you to place tools directly from &amp; ki@@ le ; can be made out .
to learn more about &amp; K@@ ate ; and his possibilities should be experienced the manual to K@@ ate . users of &amp; ki@@ le ; can you place there directly with reading the chapter , work with the editor of &amp; K@@ ate ; begin .
&amp; ki@@ le ; offers a very practical &amp; l@@ atex ; command reference , which can be called the Men@@ Ã ¼ Help La@@ Te@@ X reference . it includes a detailed description of nearly all commands that can be found in &amp; l@@ atex ; use as well as their syntax .
a double @-@ click with penet@@ rated str@@ g button to check the &amp; tex ; -@@ word out . this means that in this way you click to \ \ par from \ \ par \ \ , only \ \ par is used only \ \ par .
when using the text with penet@@ rated left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied into the clip@@ board .
when using the arrow keys with penet@@ rated switch @-@ old , parts of the source text can be used in the editor window .
&amp; ki@@ le ; has the possibilities to search the most different types of source texts and to highlight them . for example , the &amp; l@@ atex ; commands from normal text and also the mathematical form@@ ul@@ ae are highlighted by another color .
many assist@@ ants may serve as well as the corresponding button of book@@ marks or the corresponding button of book@@ marks or the corresponding buttons , highlighted the jump to the same or last jumping brand . this is also the spring@@ board highlighted , so that it is automatically applied during the first input of a character .
editing is probably one of the main aspects associated with using a program like &amp; ki@@ le ; even though &amp; K@@ ate ; important functions have been added to write a &amp; l@@ atex ; important functions for writing a &amp; l@@ atex ; special commands for their selection . under Edi@@ tions are the following commands to describe their selection :
weighing a complete paragraph ( group of lines that contain on both sides a blank line ) . with a paragraph there is not a text with continuous lines ( as in other text dit@@ ations ) . these advanced meaning slept with tables , &amp; l@@ atex ; commands and all other lines of source code . the only prev@@ ent@@ ative thing in &amp; ki@@ le ; is thus that the absorption is separated by two blank lines .
choose the word under the current cursor position . this selection also has an extended meaning , since this command also has a l@@ atex ; commands with a edges ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
for setting up a part of the document can be removed from this first . &amp; K@@ ate ; provides the keyboard C@@ trl ; K with which the whole row is removed . &amp; ki@@ le ; provides with its own commands , for a faster de@@ hydr@@ o . under Edi@@ ting , the following commands are included to the layout of the text :
remove a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; ki@@ le ; is included in the description of all storage volumes .
it has already clari@@ fied that environments play a central role in &amp; l@@ atex ; therefore offers &amp; ki@@ le ; for NF additional commands under Edit environment for an easy work with &amp; l@@ atex ;
this command is enclosed in the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to check the environment .
with this command the end of the current environment is sc@@ anned ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed right behind the command to check the surroundings .
if the cursor is in front or inside the \ \ &apos; command { surroundings } , the end of the environment is ges@@ tions ( or vice versa ) .
in the input of many ou@@ tra@@ geous ambient commands can quickly get lost quickly . this command slept off the last time , so that the con@@ gest@@ ed ambient structure is not distor@@ ted .
&amp; ki@@ le ; also offers special orders for the &amp; l@@ atex ; groups , which are determined by br@@ aces { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are a few important commands to match those from editing environment .
with this command becomes the start of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the soft cl@@ amp .
with this command the end of the current group is fed ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed right behind the mu@@ te cl@@ amp .
if the cursor is before or behind the wel@@ ded cl@@ amp of a &amp; tex ; -@@ Group # is located , becomes the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
in the input of many wel@@ ded groups @-@ brack@@ ets can quickly be lost quickly . this command will close the last group , so that the t@@ ach@@ tel@@ te structure of the &amp; tex ; -@@ groups cannot be destroyed .
in &amp; l@@ atex ; two simple application symbols are used in &amp; ki@@ le ; the character &quot; used for two simple application marks . also , the sign &quot; used for two simple application marks . also , the sign &quot; used &quot; for two simple application characters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he knows this case and for two close contact characters for &amp; l@@ atex ; one . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this automatic read@@ mill of double penetration can be set under Settings Ki@@ le ... La@@ Te@@ X - and will be eliminated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can also use L@@ Ã ¤ n@@ specific settings ( such as n@@ English or French ) , and therefore German or fran@@ z@@ ine can be used .
at the Dr@@ inking of Shift , E@@ ab@@ et@@ aste , &amp; ki@@ le ; an intelligent Z@@ eil@@ en@@ um@@ ber . if the current position is located within a lists @-@ environment ( such as en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , there is not only one line @-@ up but at the same time the command \ \ item .
inside a tables -@@ environment slept &amp; ki@@ le ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with an end @-@ off guard off .
even better - &amp; ki@@ le ; is intelligent enough to support pres@@ et &amp; l@@ atex ; - or user @-@ defined environments to support . these can be found at Settings ki@@ le ; setup ... La@@ Te@@ X .
some users wish to arrange the columns in tables with each other . &amp; ki@@ le ; tries to con@@ fine with each other . at the wires of Shift ; Alt ; amp ; she seeks to help with the lower Tab@@ ulator in the upstairs row . although this tab@@ ulator is not the associated , for the columns position of the current tab@@ ulator .
although &amp; K@@ ate ; already has a good source code which has already been installed in &amp; ki@@ le ; for special orders ( mostly for &amp; l@@ atex ; ) are still extended . they are three according to need and the other two are designed for automatic wiring . all of these modes can be configured for different work@@ ings under Settings Ki@@ le .
at the beginning a new environment using the command \ \ begin { surroundings } will &amp; ki@@ le ; automatically add the command \ \ end { surroundings } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
when you choose the R@@ Ã ¼ inch , the last letter is removed and thus the default list is the default list . on the other hand , the list is also res@@ ized by entering another character as well .
all commands will be written with a brief description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions are included in the selection of a command . alternatively , you can choose from &amp; ki@@ le ; alternatively , jumping mat is included , so that a simple jump to these positions can be folded by editing N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ ste jumping brand and the desired parameters can be added .
under Settings ki@@ le ; set up ... ki@@ le ; understanding enables you to place settings on these lists . it enables you to choose different wonders for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; l@@ atex ; commands as well as taste of the common language used .
the command ls mode is intended for the use of environments not expensive . there are always a few letters with \ \ &apos; then entered a big list with ambient settings . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; ki@@ le ; a special mode for the contamination of the environments .
in the call of the trans@@ ference mode , the Men@@ Ã ¼ r@@ ind Alt + Shift key , the command for the trac@@ table of the environment will be automatically included and it appears \ \ begin { . after that , the ambient contamination will continue in the easiest way and ended by Dr@@ ying the input key .
once this is accomplished , the environment will be automatically closed again . once &amp; ki@@ le ; recognizes that it is a lists environment , even a first \ \ item command is included .
under Settings ki@@ le ; set up ... ki@@ le ; understanding possible settings to these lists are used . this mode uses the cross @-@ list of the complete mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; l@@ atex ; commands .
&amp; ki@@ le ; under@@ lining user @-@ defined lists of abstr@@ actions that are immediately replaced by setting up strings ... Ki@@ le Ver@@ tical cross . as an example of a subscri@@ bing list , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which for example the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , the letter L is entered and the word de@@ activated mode , the Men@@ Ã ¼ n@@ ave Str@@ g + Alt spac@@ eb@@ ar , the letter L will be replaced by the character chain \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
big gu@@ arding are not helpful for automatic wiring . however , it has been noted that many w@@ allet in a document has been written more than once . thus offers &amp; ki@@ le ; the off@@ ence for all already written gu@@ ardi@@ ans .
this mode can be set in the menu settings Ki@@ le ... Ki@@ le Ver@@ ci@@ pher is shi@@ el@@ ded . here , the swelling can also be set for the display of the validation .
the encryption files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / complete / mode / complete / mode / complete / mode / a private home folder . mode is here for filing ( separation ) , Dic@@ tionary ( W@@ rit@@ r@@ ter@@ book ) or tex .

PS files are not as known as PDF files , but provide an excellent basis for transport and rev@@ itali@@ zation of pages . if the PDF output is arranged , the pages can be arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script tools and then converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file .
to focus the outcome of the work , you have to compile the source code . all of the building tools are group@@ ed in the men@@ tions create comp@@ iling , creation and creation view .
for the comp@@ iling of the source for viewers like &amp; oc@@ ular ; or the further conversion can be used to the key@@ word Alt ; 2 . after that , the DVI ; file is in default by Alt ; 3 , using Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file is converted into an PS file and by old ; 5 the PS file is viewed .
when using the command &apos;s Quick structure is usually called a viewer after comp@@ iling . should not be used in@@ und@@ ated viewer , each time a new window will be used .

the script function of &amp; ki@@ le ; allows the replacement of EC@@ MA@@ Script co@@ de . scripts can be managed in the per@@ pen@@ dic@@ ular corp@@ ses .
the API scripts are not end@@ lessly developed and can be found in other versions of &amp; ki@@ le ; even more .
the first thing must be said that the Ex@@ plan@@ ing environment of the scripts in &amp; ki@@ le ; a system @-@ wide object ( = ki@@ le ) has the following methods :
&amp; l@@ atex ; is a quite unusual system , which enables basic functions to be expanded by a variety of additional packages . &amp; ki@@ le ; offers a lot of different help to support users .

an accomplished refer@@ n@@ z for &amp; tex ; and his e@@ â , the name of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but rather is an accomplished manual for the &amp; l@@ atex ; commands and is therefore ideal for searching for a specific form@@ atting . since it is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; ki@@ le ; divided into three important book@@ marks .
due to the amount of documents with those &amp; tet@@ ex ; / lyrics live ; the small application offers &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ tured ; the small application of tex@@ k , which includes a database with all to &amp; ki@@ le ; delivered documents and here for a graphical surface area .
all documents are divided into categories and the main advantage is the search for parcel name or keywords . from &amp; ki@@ le ; then only the results are displayed .

everyone who has worked with the &amp; KDE ; he said pro@@ c and how super@@ ra@@ ined it . we still lift it a piece , we give it a graphical surface ! no longer rely on a terminal ; simply click on the symbol for the XML processor .
this application is expecting a inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is set in the secre@@ tive working folder , then release the current working folder . if not , then remove the selection of current operating folders and enter it in the folder of other folder to the desired folder .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous and HTML ; files will be deleted every time , if said pro@@ c .
as already said , each of whom already worked on the &amp; KDE ; documentation already worked , knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ alle ; there is now a great graphical surface for this .
if the straight file inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is , then they simply leave the current working folder . if not , then select the actual working folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book can be found .
when it comes to an output on the screen , its file is faul@@ ty . please check the reported errors and try again .
if the re@@ viewing file is already marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; then they leave the current file simply hal@@ ted . if not , they delete the tick and select the file output by means of other file - file selection .

enter the name of the file as the result should be named . the file is usually stored in their home folder .
the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; even possibly have little to do . this is the plug @-@ in system very powerful . they can &apos;t wait from the additional functionality and must not wait until someone can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements can be used further below .
to install a plugin or a K@@ Part , we begin using the menu plugins . this will open the following dialog :
this dialog allows to manage all of the plugins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; -@@ element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug @-@ ins are used without a location location &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; this path to the search of the plug @-@ in .
often we work on one project several persons in a style hierarch@@ ical relationship . &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ alle ; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project @-@ properties -@@ dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and is used for unique identification .
a member can have multiple roles in the project , such as both team manager and sub@@ project leader .
the user can look out of the list of members who he is . this happens by clicking the team member from the list and expresses the button . the currently selected member ( their identi@@ ties ) appears after which you are : text .
nick@@ name and setting of your own identity are important regarding messages and notes . see for further information on ann@@ ot@@ ations .
in addition to the overview of their team there is another advantage through the acquisition of the members of the team : it can be created an event for information to the team manager when something is happening . see in for further information .
event actions are actions that will be executed when something specific in the project happens . an example would be drawing up the opening and closing of the project so that later someone else has been saved , or the sending of a message when a file is backed up , or a script that will add a file to the CV@@ S as soon as they added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the site event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Proj@@ ection Di@@ alo@@ ges can be edited , edited and deleted .
an E@@ Mail is sent to the recipients selected in the recipient list . address sat can be a team@@ - or sub@@ project manager . see in , we@@ i such ladder will be set up .
comments are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
enter comments is simple . it can be either chosen by the note -@@ entry from the editor @-@ context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation key@@ word entered into a commentary area followed by a detailed text .
notes may be sent a determin@@ ative member of the team . in this case the syntax ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , plays a role in the project from the following possibilities : team manager of sub@@ project leaders should be specified in the range of departments or sub@@ project names , as in the following examples below .
nick@@ name and roll names are independent of large or small @-@ writing , but space around the brack@@ ets and the : make the note invalid .
&amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ alle ; is a development environment for scrip@@ t- and form@@ atting languages , the D@@ T@@ D diagnostic and web @-@ based form@@ atting and scrip@@ ting languages supported .
the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ us ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in .
the settings can be set up by means of Settings Qu@@ anta . Th@@ ing Dialog extends over some pages that will be dealt with each other .
the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; with regard to tags including car rental , can be modified . the entries are :
large / small writing of tags : big / small writing of automatically assigned tags . normal young / sp@@ elling means , the tags will be inserted as described in the day XML files .
large / small writing of attributes : large / small writing of automatically charged attributes . normal young / sp@@ elling means , the attributes are inserted as inserted in the day XML files .
optional Tags automatically shut : if attached , is optional for tags , for which the exclusive day is optional , this immediately after bed ; inserted .
do not include optional tags : how above for all other tags with exception of the simple tags .
start and completion date automatically update : if enabled , the corresponding tag will be changed and vice versa .
automatic detection of acc@@ ent characters : controls automatic transformation of acc@@ entu@@ ated characters in the corresponding co@@ ding during inser@@ ting .
MI@@ ME types : Mim@@ e@@ yp@@ s to detect different types of files . by means of the standard standard the default ones can be recovered .
default character co@@ ding : encoding of newly created or in other way than using file opening open files ( where the co@@ ding of the file can be passed ) . however , this setting is loaded from the same in the project features , if a project is loaded .
standard D@@ T@@ D : the selected D@@ T@@ D will be used for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ T@@ D was not detected . however , this setting here is inserted from the same into the project features , if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy ; it creates regularly backup copies , so that in a black@@ out or cr@@ ashing over the next start of the program the document can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as the storing of the file . this is not the same as the storing of the file . also for not yet stored documents will be a backup regularly , according to the specified time , created .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editing area or a separate view ( or the documentation in a map ) which makes it possible to preview the documentation , the preview and the source code at the same time .
set the shut@@ ters on the default back at the next start is useful when the user interface by modi@@ fying the MDI modes and and@@ o@@ ids / depend on views through each other . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameters .
the War@@ n@@ feed@@ backs area serves the tax of the ability to turn the ad of warnings by an@@ hooks of no more queries .
the place to change the behaviour of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can be the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ isation of V@@ PL@@ - and the source code view in its shared mode . see the different modes .
here the par@@ ser and the structure of the structure can be set to the picture of the Par@@ ser @-@ No@@ des in the document .
in the area of mouse @-@ click on the structure of the structure , it is possible to change the action by clicking the structural tree with the mouse buttons .
in the area of struc@@ turing @-@ tree settings , the visibility of no@@ des can be automatically opened in the tree , the actu@@ ality of the tree during the editing process and how deep when changing the structural tree should be opened automatically . blank no@@ des are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are such , where no element has been found in the current document .
the area to the fixing of abbreviations ( one type of templates ) which can be un@@ folded in groups , each can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; this means it can give a valid group for PHP in which the i@@ f@@ ters det@@ ector something else than in a group is valid for Javascript .
here you can manage the plugins . plug @-@ ins are K@@ Part @-@ applications of the third page , which can be re@@ used by any K@@ Part @-@ capable application , at the most famous &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; at inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in must be specified in the following :
address : the path to the plugin , if it does not lie at a standard place like $ K@@ DE@@ DIR / lib .
input : this information is handed over to the plug @-@ in at the start , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
component in &quot; Only @-@ L@@ ese &quot; mode load : check if the plugin is denied boarding . only @-@ L@@ ese K@@ parts usually refuse the shop if this option is not chosen .
check the plugin : is this activated , then test@@ et &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; if the given information is correct , then the storing of the entry is also available if the plugin is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; from version 3.3 , the fault @-@ search for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) de@@ bu@@ gger has been adjusted , as well as the support for the db@@ g Debug@@ ger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger @-@ Plugin concept has been implemented , which enables various implement@@ ations about plugins .
currently only a plugin available , support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; App@@ ly adds .
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with selecting a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plugins in the project settings . with the button options next to the Debug@@ ger @-@ Plugin selection , the specific settings can be changed .
if a de@@ bu@@ gger is activated for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; interface :
a view that is displayed in the content of monitored variables . usually appears in the left dock .
a view , in which all the holding points , with line numbers and conditions are listed . usually appears in the lower dock .
a view that the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is shown . usually appears in the lower dock .
depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger , if necessary , or she shares the plugin with , on Deb@@ u@@ gan@@ demands . this action is opened by default when a project is opened to a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that normally does not need to be respected .
the counter@@ part to de@@ bu@@ gging session starts the session . closes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or ends the sounds according to requirements .
send a HTTP request to the server to initiate a de@@ bug request . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this requirement is displayed in the de@@ bu@@ gger issue .
indicates the de@@ bu@@ gger to begin with the execution of the script and current information on the monitored variables as well as the current specified line continuously . if this happens when the script is attached , the execution is continued before a debit request has been started , the script starts with the request .
indicates the de@@ bu@@ gger to begin with the execution of the script , without information on monitored variables and the current tick number . if this happens , the execution moves further . happens it before a debit request has been given , the execution starts as soon as a requirement is made .
the de@@ bu@@ gger introduces the next directive in the script without re@@ acting in the functions or in@@ clu@@ des .
the de@@ bu@@ gger introduces the next directive in the script , with if possible in functions and in@@ clu@@ des .
indicates the de@@ bu@@ gger to move the statement and go to the next one , as if there were not the current .
opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered , which is to be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
this dialog can be entered a variable or set a new value to a variable .

this chapter describes how you can adapt &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ us ; to suit your needs and how you can help and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ us ; help you get better .
document packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; to give support for Mark@@ up@@ - and scrip@@ ting languages as well as &amp; CSS ; you allow &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; abilities such as car to complete and hub trees ; a quick , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script folder and / CSS ; and Tag@@ XML files with extension .@@ bi@@ ds are handmade , symbo@@ lic@@ ally @-@ oriented bodies of image balls ( above the editing window ) to insert the text and instructions faster into a document than a user ever could .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing D@@ T@@ D . see in for details on conversion .
this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to be created , then the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool @-@ toolbar . short , one &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the peculi@@ arities ; the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . work@@ bla@@ sting allow a fast inser@@ ting tags in a document without the risk of a typ@@ ist .
tag folders are nothing but folders . they contain only the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folder carry the name of the description language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ 85@@ )
the table below lists the elements of the equ@@ ations on and de@@ kl@@ ed whether they are necessary or not . although not all necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible , so that other users have improved insight and more information when working with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limitations is set forth in a simple way .
this is the root element of an equ@@ XML document . it can only contain once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains as only the element type over themselves otherwise nothing else .
the type of tags is a script function . when used is charged , att@@ r &gt; an argument to function . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the day @-@ type class . the name of the basic class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the Type meth@@ od . returns the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the day has a sub@@ code attribute and the attributes within these tags can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 )
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the one ; text &gt; -@@ day . this is a single element type item .
describe an attribute of a tags . this item can only happen once for each attribute . it defines the name and type of the attribute . additionally it contains more tags you describe how this attribute is to be displayed &amp; etc ; This is an only element element .
returns the source code for the filling used for the attributes in the tag Editor dialog and in the attribute tree .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; is used for reaching the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; is used to achieve the data source .
requiring source = d@@ co@@ p , a stroke and a method name . the arguments that can be passed to the method . can be empty or % day name % , which means the name of the current tag .
a container tag that group@@ ed the elements of a list . it can only happen for an attribute description only once . it is a single element element .
sets the position of the attribute of a tags within a dialog box . this day can only happen for any attribute in a dialog only once ( e.g. once for each and lt ; att@@ r &gt; day ) . the element is empty .
returns the position and size of a field in dialogue . this day should be present for every field in dialogue ( e.g. one for each and lt ; att@@ r &gt; and lt ; label &gt; day ) . this element is empty .
returns a list of elements that may occur within the defined tags . this element is an only element type .
returns a list of elements that end a day . this item is an only element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must begin with a &amp; XML ; de@@ activated ; ? XML version = 1.0 En@@ co@@ ding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be neat and closed .
space can influence nothing but pay attention to &amp; and &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; will not be replaced , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the tools dialog up in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; window to start and check equ@@ X@@ ML@@ A . another dialog will appear to follow the simple instructions to follow .
this feature is currently not available . at present , the review is done only when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ;
in the following an example of a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; Schema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; -@@ schema . the fil@@ ename for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following an example of a functioning family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the fil@@ ename of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&quot; &quot; &quot; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; En@@ co@@ ding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &gt; &amp; lt ; att@@ r name = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt;
the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is equally simple and there is an editor to be accessible via D@@ T@@ D Bear@@ be@@ ite D@@ T@@ D settings . this enables di@@ ed@@ es@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for one out of a list sel@@ ectable &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; a simple &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; should be created a simple &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; a simple &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; should be created with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; version = use 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for any higher version . name = D@@ T@@ D ; / / D@@ T@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) nick@@ name = The simplified name of the D@@ T@@ D . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name .
an action can set up with settings promotions ... click New action leads to the same dialog :
this promotion is weigh@@ ted key@@ note . with clicking the user &apos;s button , a key@@ note can be assigned to a keyboard short@@ cut ; with K@@ einer is the current keyboard short@@ cut .
the simplest actions . it can be inserted into the det@@ ector settings and in the execution of action this text is inserted in the document to the current cursor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action you can change external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) to change the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ us ; self are the quick start @-@ dialogue or the different Behold in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps .
first , the name of the script and interpreter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ home / my@@ scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / dev / qu@@ anta / scripts in your path : $ PA@@ TH There are other special variable that can be used in the command line :
% f : we replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file is called file : / from the document name .
% P@@ ID : is replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; only one instance is running , the text is copied to the P@@ ID number . this is useful if D@@ COP is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; from the external script .
the parameters for this event , normally the fil@@ ename of the current document or the path to the project file .
in addition to the above methods there can be a script input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; at the default record . in the selection field input may be determined what is to send to the standard input . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected range of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually useful only with this setting .
accordingly , the output can also be re@@ directed . there are two types of output : normal output , written on the default output ; error messages , to the default output . it can be specified , which should be done with the text written on the default output by setting the value of the selection panel :
if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to share the tags in logical groups . in this case it is necessary to create a toolbar with the name of the market .
once a toolbar has been added , you must add actions and configure . select settings settings .
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts the editing mode .
fill in all the required fields and add them to the appropriate toolbar .
complete everything and , if the tag has attributes and you plan their use , activate dialogue &quot; tag , if available , so that a input is possible when using the action .
Ig@@ itt ! is that a ugly symbol . who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol ? replace it before we have difficulties .
to create a symbol that the action is better represented , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; choose from the &amp; menu ; , graphic Fur@@ ther programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size others .
please note that the created symbol does not only help you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P .
with regard to that the day start , I decided to create a start@@ up as a symbol . through the use of green ( green is usually interpreted as los , rigid , further interpreted ) , or should at least to sign@@ aled a message to the user that clicking this symbol is a &amp; lt ; start tag in the current document .
after the creation of the symbol it must still be connected to the action . this happens through the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; ) and selection of the desired action . besides the text box is a button , press it .
select the folder in which the stored icon is , select it and confirm with OK .
press the apply button and continue to continue with other tags , so there are , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some usual &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; functions to the toolbar or it should be shared to a better overview of some separ@@ ators into several groups . open the toolbar setting dialog by setting the toolbar . make sure that the required toolbar can be selected .
I want to choose the separ@@ ators ( very left above ) for my toolbar . according to the selection of the element that is to be added to the toolbar button , you press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the toolbar .
for example , I want to preview you a quick way to access the Con@@ quer@@ or Preview . I will pick it and add to the toolbar .
please note how the separ@@ ators support group@@ ing . someone who does not know my toolbar , could believe that the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; button the opposite of the start @-@ button is .
the new toolbar must be tested by pro@@ ving all symbols to ensure that everything works .
back up in the correct folder . after new XML does not exist , it will be saved in the correct folder , but your toolbar button should be saved in the correct folder . please match her &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; so that their toolbar can be loaded ( n ) if a file is opened by the appropriate type .
perhaps the most worth enlargement of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ us ; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or form@@ atting language you like to most . therefore , this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; Documentation tree for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; -@@ Re@@ pository check if someone has done it for you already .
there are two parts in this process . first , you need to look for an existing documentation for form@@ atting / script / etc ; language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . first part we leave you , the second part we treat here .
# KDE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc 1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Section 2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Section 2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html = Sec@@ 2.@@ 3.@@ html = Sec@@ 2.@@ 3.@@ html = Sec@@ 2.@@ 3.@@ html = Sec@@ 2.@@ 3.@@ html = Sec@@ 2.@@ 3.@@ html 2 = tag@@ 1.@@ html pages 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html
the tree tree defines the visible part of documentation in the docum@@ ent@@ ations tree . for example , you can see now in the &amp; PHP ; documentation so something :
# KDE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element Top Element = PHP 4.2 Specific Table of Cont@@ ents = inde@@ x.@@ html ge@@ ting Start@@ ed = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ synchron@@ at@@ .@@ html ...
note the # before Get@@ ting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this indicates that it is the sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known border for the chess box ( except for reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
you remember that the index is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequ@@ ent at the top end of the building vision &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is displayed ! ) .
space can influence nothing but pay attention to &amp; and &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ us ; resources are replaced .
the content section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file which is intended to display the context @-@ context sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; script will display the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file binding .
a simple list of se@@ ded separate context elements which should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can easily store your file do@@ cr@@ c / share / etc / qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DIR / share / dev / qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as specified in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation .
if you are sure that these are well and worth it , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. what documentation were used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; -@@ Community . you will not get rich , but proud to have worked with the best web platform platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ alle ; are you not alone . it is possible to share the separ@@ ating resources ( D@@ TE@@ P Packages , toolbar button with others , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or elsewhere . at different places there is an email to send menu entry , such as D@@ T@@ D D@@ T@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts .
the resources can be uploaded to our main archive , from where all other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ alle ; users can download them and only be available if our team needs them as correct and use@@ full for publication . to sign the resources to sign the resources , it provides a GP@@ G / P@@ GP key . thus , the origin of the resources is guaranteed , both for our team and for later users .
at the up@@ loading , you will be asked for their private GP@@ G key ( the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event you have multiple keys you can go on . in dialogue New resource you need to stay empty ( URL preview can remain empty ) and clicking OK the Upload .
the high load can be up@@ loading from the D@@ T@@ D D@@ T@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , up@@ loading the toolbar icons , and in the context menu of files and folders in the Templates and scripts tree .
after downloading a resource , still before installation , investig@@ ates &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ us ; the integrity of the resource by checking of integrity and signature . in case of problems war@@ es and it can then be canc@@ eled . please note the warning messages carefully . if the integrity is given and the resource correctly signed , a message appears with the indication of the author of the resource .
it is possible to work on XML @-@ languages , which is currently not created by &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; but the creation may be time @-@ consuming , because hundreds of tag files in the day XML format may be necessary . it gives the easiest way to convert a D@@ T@@ D automatically into a D@@ TE@@ P package .
the conversion can be started from the D@@ T@@ D shop and Convert a D@@ T@@ D . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the D@@ T@@ D description which is to be used . after that , the following dialog appear :
target directory : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / dev / qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! DO@@ C@@ TY@@ PE definition : the string that will appear in ! DO@@ C@@ TY@@ PE day , such as HTML Public - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / D@@ T@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / ht@@ m@@ l@@ 4 /
fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if activated , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; after converting the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; Editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this possibility .
in &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ alle ; there are some key concepts . to understand this and get full use of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ us ; therefore , one must first familiarize themselves with these fundamental concepts . this chapter attempts to bring them precisely these concepts without whose understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ us ; little benefit .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ alle ; the working area is divided into three areas : global , locally and project @-@ related . this distinction affects a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; .
global elements are available for each , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; it is available . of tool @-@ bla@@ sts on actions is all that is marked as globally , in which joint folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; saved . this allows the group of administrators differently to secure the toolbar , actions and patterns in the global tree , which is then available to each in a multi @-@ user environment at the system .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and toolbar . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are available only within a specific project . this can be everything from &amp; CSS ; patterns can be specially formulated for the files of a particular project . simply , this is the most limited size . all elements are set in the folder @-@ tree of the project , which is the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project em@@ bo@@ ar .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; MDI ; consists of some main areas : the editing window , the component views , the cart@@ ons with information and the toolbar . please hit , and for more information on these areas .
you can click on the map @-@ on with the right mouse button to re@@ load a context menu with the current document lists , re@@ charging , delete or up@@ loading the document , jump to a book@@ mark or version of CV@@ S commands to the current document .
justification in the editing area lead to a further context menu regarding the edited document content , such as basic machining steps ( cut / copy / paste ) , editing of using the mouse @-@ cursor tags , help to the word using the mouse pointer or opening the file , if the string is referred to as a file under the mouse @-@ cursor .
at the top of the editing window , the toolbar can be found . at present , &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as a standard for which a set of toolbar can be shown . in the course of further development of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ us ; the toolbar can be adapted to the new functions and related user needs .
the use of toolbar button is really easy . if they want to insert it ; then click the icon that represents the day . now they can insert the data for this just one day . if you want to insert the data for this just one day ( such as Anchor ) , you can fill in a dialog different fields .
the architectural views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow it to open up and strip in the information . in the representation with cart@@ els are available for files , project , templates , scripts , attributes , and documentation .
project Management is a powerful tool that provides all files in the project and allows the managing files in the project by right mouse click . actions like adding , removal , up@@ loading or delete files from storage media can then be performed with the context menu .
another option of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ alle ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : images , program parts , a whole web page &amp; etc . there are all possibilities open .
templates can be divided into three categories , depending on which it is used . the category is always available , local templates are available only for the respective users and templates in projects are available only in the project . more on templates is available .
here you can find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of incorpor@@ ation in Global , Local and Project also works here . by clicking with the left mouse button you can retrieve the available information on a script . the right mouse button is available for example , to edit , edit or send the script via email .
with this view , one shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cursor is set to the position of the element . by right @-@ click of an element , a list of commands opens in terms of navigation and re@@ fres@@ her of the building .
this tree appears under the other construction views . with it can change a fast attributes and nam@@ esp@@ ace . that allows all available attributes with few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation on the Web @-@ technology for your development . it can be downloaded pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; it can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project , project @-@ specific documentation can be edited , edited and viewed .
by default , &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ alle ; two tab@@ s at the bottom of the window , can be reached via the beneficial information : the news window and the problem window .
this cart@@ on shows information about each in Qu@@ anta running script . such is the used D@@ T@@ D of the current document and all changes to the D@@ T@@ D .
this cart@@ on shows all errors in the pop @-@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; scripts that will be executed , give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ orts are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they get the appropriate command displayed . the chocolate page of the toolbar is the opportunity to define own orders as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; to define .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ alle ; is the ability to mail a tool toolbar with e @-@ mail . it sends the toolbar as a compressed T@@ ar @-@ archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; if they receive a toolbar in an e @-@ mail , they can secure it in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; like any other backup and load !
it is reasonable if you want to customize the place of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , enter . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not executed here .
if you have trouble downloading &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ us ; you should check if your path contains the &amp; KDE ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that no older version of &amp; KDE ; 3 in PA@@ TH in front of her bin folder . same applies to &amp; Q@@ t .
&amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ alle ; is a web development tool for KDE interface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ alle ; was optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
during the endeavor to create the best &amp; HTML ; Editor , the developers began to deal with a close idea : what would be if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ us would be ? well , this would make him an absolutely greatest web development tool for &amp; KDE ; so it was done .
no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; it &apos;s already far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . together , if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then it should be &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ us ; for the appropriate &amp; IDE ; be the appropriate &amp; IDE ;
well , to the above claim has to be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ us ; as product is based on the outstanding efforts of the whole &amp; KDE ; development community is based on . &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; as follows , in good use of free software , the idea of why developed ? thanks to the &amp; KDE ; sc@@ aff@@ old is not only this all possible but it allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; so to bro@@ aden how they need it for their needs .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ alle ; allows web developers to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( MDI ; ) . this can increase productivity almost every task . through the program Kom@@ ar you can have to remember them &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron , without having to remember a scrip@@ ting language . ( more about it you will find in . )
&amp; qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment designed for HTML and related languages . it was designed for a fast web development and was quickly developed to a well @-@ proven editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; qu@@ anta ; plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of &amp; qu@@ anta ; the original developers settled the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program .
read more in the details of the documentation is associated with help : / qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or k@@ help@@ center help : / qu@@ anta ) .
&amp; qu@@ anta ; is currently developed and supervised by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon sequ@@ it@@ ur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file which is not located , where the oldest entry is taken out .
this allows you to store code parts and whole files as templates for later use . if you &apos;re trying to store the selected file / text outside the local / project pres@@ cho@@ oses , only one error is reported .
conver@@ ts when inser@@ ting the clip@@ board used there special characters to the &amp; HTML ; feed , so that they are correctly displayed and not mis@@ understood by the browser as form@@ atting instructions .
conver@@ ts the text from the clip@@ board in &amp; URL ; write @-@ up , which is the correct way to inser@@ ting special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; first and foremost to inser@@ ting &amp; URL ; s in the anchor tag .
switches the block choice respectively . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift key .
goes directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; script error messages can occur !
searches for a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a type of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined phrases to help you .

initial and intim@@ id@@ ant of problem @-@ por@@ ters at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; main window . the problem re@@ porter is activated once you change the structural tree .
displays the toolbar icons on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with one mouse click .
if there is book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with the entries previous or next , depending on the position of the cursor in the document .
book@@ marks from other open documents appear in the menu group@@ ed according to the fil@@ ename of other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ us ; -@@ projects are stored with the file called .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog to insert files into the current project . selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
through the project directory for new files that could be there . this enables to copy the video files into your project folder or sub@@ folders and then add them to the project .
load the files in your project on the server high . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; KDE ; and if you have downloaded more input / output module ( K@@ IO Sl@@ aves ) .
settings , how &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ us ; the project manages . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; - Projects you will find the details explained .
loads a project @-@ toolbar . these are kept in project you / tool@@ bars and are only available in this menu when you have assigned it to this project .
a dialog to store your toolbar . allows you to select the type of toolbar button : locally or project .
opens a dialog to add a new toolbar . this creates just the name . actions must be saved using settings actions ... added to the toolbar or you will be asked to save whether you want to store the toolbar .
remove a toolbar from the field of view . this del@@ etes it from the hard disk . if you have not yet saved the toolbar , you will be asked if you want to do it .
this allows you to send their own toolbar button to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; -@@ team so that the toolbar can be present in the next publication ) . the menu item opens a new e @-@ mail message with the toolbar .
allows up@@ loading of the toolbar on the main server , where everyone can access it . see in .
download one &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; that you or anything else has made and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; own description @-@ format .
download / refresh the entities from the &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; it is useful when the entities &quot; entities &quot; from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; to renew it without the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and a typ@@ ist in the global KDE folder is not available , the shop fails .
this menu contains a list of tags . if the standard ( HTML ; ) toolbar is loaded , there is a sub@@ menu standard included in the Tags menu , which contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar .
allows access to the current tag dialog , if there is one . this entry is always present in the menu tags , followed by &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menu .
activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the intelligent inser@@ ting of tags . currently this only works with ( X ) HTML D@@ T@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ tion means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ us means that the inser@@ tion is denied by means of toolbar , if this day contradi@@ cts the rules .
in the plug @-@ in menu the available plugins are listed under the listed menu items . click on them . click on a activated plug @-@ in de@@ activated .
cho@@ oses the syn@@ tactic mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schem@@ ata is dependent on der@@ k@@ ate ; - version .
choose the type of line identi@@ fier . very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms to develop . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
checks the syntax of the current document according to the selected &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; by means of the external application tidy .
immediate switching between the different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the KDE libraries you can sometimes need time or rather beautiful graphics . recommended is the cart@@ el mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu contains an associated entry . with a selection of an entry , the corresponding sub@@ window will be activated .
enables displaying the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; main window to or out .
the changes in this dialog cat@@ ches any application that use the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; web browsers .
is the behavior of the editing window . in the documentation of &amp; K@@ ate ; you can find details .
a dialog appears in which you can delete entries from the toolbar or which changes the sequences .
this should generate an aid in accordance with the environment of the mouse cursor , but is not implemented yet .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ alle ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with every open source project the developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; development in financial form , they find here the way .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be completed best from top to bottom , since e.g. after filling out the project called the whole directory structure for the rest of the project . all these paths and author information fields can later be set with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project @-@ characteristics can be set .
here is the name for the project to include , for example fo@@ o . when entering name file file will be automatically filled .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; project file . by default , she has the name of the project in small letters and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can access the server address of the machine to which one wants to access , except one processed local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ Ex@@ .de ) or an IP @-@ address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
lets you empty this field empty , the default settings of the selected protocol is used . depending on the configuration of the remote host , an adjustment could be necessary .
this is the folder in which the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a joint collection of files used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder in which the toolbar can be saved for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows to insert files from the local file system into the project . you can select multiple files or whole folder .
this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . for server script script ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
def@@ ective , if files located somewhere in the main folder of the project , are to be integrated . if a project is started again on new , non @-@ ha@@ ken .
this option will display all the files and folders within the main folder and you can make a precise selection of cou@@ ches .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by clicking or by removing the h@@ ash out of the project .
the last screen of the new project assistant contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be up@@ loading in the menu with project project properties in the menu window profiles or with the keyboard short@@ cut shift ; F@@ 7 changed .
some settings correspond to those in the project assistant and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ ename ( plac@@ eholder possible ) , which are newly @-@ related to project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
comple@@ mentary option to top , also files that are listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded at opening the project . in addition , more about project views can be read .
this means that the desired de@@ bu@@ gger can be selected . currently , Gub@@ ed is supported . more information about Gub@@ ed you can find in . the de@@ bu@@ gger plugin can be set with the button options . in the de@@ bu@@ gging the de@@ bu@@ gging is described .
in the sub@@ window profiles can upload high la@@ de@@ profiles ( see in ) , as well as the display of a building @-@ view for the content of the server for each profile by pointing a separate building @-@ view for each profile .
in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see in the details .
in the sub@@ window event configuration , one can switch event actions and add these actions , modify or delete them . event actions are executed when a previously defined event occurs , like the sick@@ le of a file . see in the details .
default opens &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; the last project that was open . this behaviour can not be influenced by default .
to open another project , select project ... from the menu project or the icon project open from the toolbar . the dialog project will be displayed and allows selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ alle ; closed , the project file is automatically saved . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project .
the project management gives free access to the files in the project . there , files can be managed in the current project .
folders act as well , however the entries are opening and opening with ... in line with the right mouse button in the context menu :
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the place of the uploaded files . see below .
allows removal of the current profile . if only one profile is available , the button will end to remove the removal .
the password will be kept in the core memory and can be forgotten where most frequent loading of files is necessary and the rather in@@ secure password can be saved on the plate -@@ option does not come into question .
this will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ alle ; many flood profiles can be created and thus loaded the project ( or parts of the project ) to different servers . when editing or creating a profile will display this dialog :
this is the name of the server , to which the files are to be copied . either a fully qualified Dom@@ a@@ inn@@ ame or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; KDE ; and the installed Ki@@ o Sl@@ aves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( locally ) and NFS .
the port for transfer . usually this does not have to be changed , except the network administrator has a service not at the usual port .
depending on your anxiety , this is either a time @-@ saving function or danger . use it at your discretion . the password is stored on the plate so that it can not be easily read , but everyone with programming results can easily be seen in the plain text .
a project view is just a set of files and toolbar . it can give in a project many views , i.e. through simple diving view , various files and toolbar can be loaded and replace the currently open files and toolbar .
views can be opened in the menu project or the project toolbar , accessible via settings on the toolbar toolbar , open or deleted .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; with which one has to do most . this helps not only increase productivity , but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ us ; to its own working method .
as mentioned above are the toolbar qu@@ ir@@ sts in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; the best about the menu toolbar can be made . the adding of the toolbar can be treated below in the section Ad@@ ding of the toolbar .
the toolbar and symbols can be adjusted using the context menu ( right @-@ click on the toolbar button ) , in which with New action , a new toolbar can be executed , which results in the dialog , which can be specified in the dialog where actions can be visible on this or other work@@ toolbar .
by calling the context menu for an action ( icon ) on a toolbar , additionally the entries are removed and action are displayed , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the toolbar and the actions on them can set up in the menu with Settings toolbar and set the settings .
templates are essentially related Documents , code @-@ cut@@ ters and files to the link@@ age . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; used templates basically like a nasty fil@@ esystem with expan@@ sive organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or change any at the system existing folder into the default tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; in about the restrictions you can imagine for the fil@@ esystem .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified in the beginning of each template .
binary is all that is not pur@@ er text . it can be any file except text , so images , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc . binary templates are usually included in documents using link@@ ups ( e.g. images with IM@@ G sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the Pre @-@ tree under global templates . further information on the Templates tree is available .
documents can be created from any text document . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . normally , more specific documents can be found in appropriate sub@@ folders . some examples can be found in advance @-@ tree under global templates . see in for more information on the Templates tree .
this type of templates is useful if not a new document is to be inserted based on a template , but the same text area is always included in the documents . some examples are available in line @-@ tree under global templates . see in for more information on template tree .
as the name says , these templates serve for whole sites as templates . they are a collection of various documents which can be organized in a folder structure , p@@ ours in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ron .
create a document structure according to exposure ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and select File As Save as a template as a local template ...
once that is done , notice that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project @-@ tree . take a look at the default tree under project templates .
select text in your document and click File As you save your selection as a local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be simply dra@@ gging and dra@@ gged onto the building @-@ view templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied into a subur@@ b folder . you can use all file management functions to be used for example , to move and paste or paste into the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
you can click into the file tree or project files to create a folder on the right , and select site template , a name for the template and secure . by default the project folder will be saved , but of course it can be saved as a local or global template .
project templates allow a very pur@@ ged @-@ oriented preview mode . you can create head@@ lines and foot@@ er lines or dynamically with &amp; PHP ; shape , insert files or link with them . additionally you can keep some things in the contacting of templates in projects very profound .
the structure structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files placed in $ K@@ DE@@ DIR / share / apps / qu@@ anta / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / templates / qu@@ anta / templates . each one of these folders corresponds to one of four types of container , as explained above .
to set the behavior of a folder in the default overview with the right mouse button on the folder and select in the context menu properties . the following dialog appears :
a selection panel with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is cancelled , as soon as El@@ ter@@ ous attributes are hal@@ lowed .
this is enabled by default and does not fit for anything except the tri@@ bal folders in default overview . if a regular folder would be set out in principle except they would be explicitly activated . in case of a normal folder , the bla@@ h would appear with something like text @-@ tree . if nothing appears , you will probably be in a regular folder .
allows the illustrated head@@ lines or head@@ lines for templates in this folder . this may be general head@@ lines or foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project and allows for copying contents into a folder with special head@@ lines / head@@ lines a whole presentation already with the matching he@@ aders / foot@@ er .
in addition , you have a context menu ( click on the right mouse button ) via a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and insert templates from one place to another .
&amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ alle ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source code editor used via the menu View . the first mode replaces the source code editor in two parts : the source code editor and the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor .
the V@@ PL ; Editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ page and a cursor appears . then you can edit and turn when needed to the source code editor , in which the changes performed in the V@@ PL ; Editor is visible in the source code .
when working with the V@@ PL ; Editor on a document that contains &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . to edit &amp; PHP ; to edit , the source code editor will continue to edit . there is no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works exactly like the first , except that the changes are visible in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; Editor is already active , this mode is already active , the key@@ press release the active cursor from a window to another , where the position in the document is maintained .
the synchronization distance between the V@@ PL ; Editor and the source code editor is adjustable via settings Qu@@ anta . you can choose between synchron@@ isation after one click or automatically . in addition , the recommendation can be set between synchron@@ isation after one click or automatically . in addition , the recommendation may be set in addition to the time span . basically the recommendation is recommended for fast calculator and a large spine for slow .
suppose you want to change the title of the website , so is tools possible . this document features will also be called once a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; editor will also be created when a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; the editor will also change the reduction of the suspension . this allows you to change the following :
meta tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . meta @-@ elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . a click into the list allows changing the content , e.g. keywords on the column names and key@@ word key@@ word 2 on the content -@@ column .
CSS rules are the new way to design the view of pages in the browser . you can add CSS @-@ rules with the buttons under the list or delete a change about the list is exactly as possible with meta @-@ elements . editing of CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS @-@ style template by pressing the file @-@ open button and select the corresponding file .
the use of the c@@ urs@@ ors is as usual in a text processing , possible by due to the arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the cursor works as usual . text can be inserted as usual . text can be inserted by typ@@ es@@ ar and sli@@ pped by means of return or removal .
inser@@ ting tags will be done in the same way via the toolbar button , as in the source code editor , made . it is to note that inser@@ ting tags previously already existing identical tags are not removed e.g. when an anchor day , surrounded by text , any other circum@@ ference anchor must be removed .
some of the toolbar icons such as the tables assistant or the lists assistant are disabled . they will be later used in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release you have to use the tables or lists of the toolbar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for examination of style templates . in contrast to other programs for styles , the search for certain elements is possible and the execution of the style can be pursued . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to compile &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; successfully compile , need except &amp; KDE ; nor the libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ x@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ x@@ ml which are already available at a typical installation of &amp; KDE ;
hold in a template , at a point in one of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g uploaded style or x@@ ml file or at the current node . new in x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in g@@ d@@ b compatibility mode , can be set in a specified file and line number and later activated .
x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g determines the complete path from a fil@@ ename without a path name . fil@@ ename in the same folder as the top uploaded file names with relative path to the working folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g is required for example an style file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .@@ x@@ s@@ l , the following input is possible :
this command is checked for a partial or complete agreement with a pres@@ age called QNAP ME or a specified model name . &amp; eg ; template agrees with each QNAP NAS that contains the string template .
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the given &quot; QNAP ME &quot; is added to the rules defined by the name defined in the X@@ SL source file . X@@ SL : test@@ 1 will be added to htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 199 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a desirable holding player must be dissolved for the associated UR@@ I and line number . this is automatically executed when loading the first template through x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . gri@@ ep@@ points will be re @-@ checked automatically after the start of each flow .

the con@@ duction was very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ors had done many changes and at the same time had corrected a lot of positions in the same file . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts in the merging .
the program used by me only showed me the modified lines , but I could not see what exactly changed within these lines . and there was no indications of the places where perhaps only the objection had changed . the merging of these changes was a small night@@ mare .
so that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could be differences within one line and changes to white signs . later , any amount of more useful functions have been added .
for example , if you want to compare your text quickly , simply copy it into the clip@@ board and paste it in one of the comparative window .
a function made a lot of work was the same and merging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost in a full file browser .
also 3 @-@ way @-@ assemb@@ ling is fully supported . this is useful when two people work independently of each other in one piece of co@@ de and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps dis@@ solve conflicts and displays at the same time the expected result . in this Editor , you can even edit the result directly . the scre@@ enshot shows three Qu@@ ell files in the assemb@@ ling :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; helps you also with the compar@@ isons and merge complete folder . this scre@@ enshot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folder @-@ assemb@@ ling :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences and load the possibilities of present color monitors . if you often have to check co@@ de , you will like this function .
differences in white signs and tab@@ s are shown visible . if lines differ only in a certain number of white signs , one can see this on a look at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no hassle ) if someone changing the ind@@ entation . )
when a file is identical , and the other is different in one line , then the color shows that file is different . red color means that both files differ .
if all files have the same name , but in different folders , you can make yourself the ti@@ pping work easier by simply write the fil@@ ename of the first file completely .
cold 3 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 3 folder 2 folder 3 folder 3 folder .
opening @-@ dialog allows manual verification of fil@@ ename , the selection over the file browser ( file ... ) or the output of a recently opened file from the folding list . you don &apos;t need to specify third file next time . you do not need to specify third file ; if you leave the entry for C , the analysis of differences with two files will be performed .
about the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you choose a folder , the same or merging of folders . if for A file is selected , for B and C however a folder , then used &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ ename from A in the two other folders .
if inter@@ woven , the input field is actively involved and can be processed . however , it is not necessarily required to specify an output file immediately . you can get this step later when saving .
the setup button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before you start using the same / assemb@@ ling .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to select text parts from the clip@@ board into the active comparative window . in the opening dialog you don &apos;t have to select files , you can simply close the dialog with the inter@@ rupt button .
you can also use drag and drop : just drag a file from a file manager or select text from one editor and let it fall over a comparative window .
which thought is behind it ? sometimes , a file contains e.g. several similar features . if you would like to find out how similar to these functions , this would be a relatively large effort . they would have only to load two corresponding files , load them in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; download and then compare them . now , you can simply copy the relevant sections simply , paste and then compare .
note : at present , you can not pull anything out of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the pit@@ falls of text in a comparative window will be supported .
warning : some editors interpret the pulling and drop text into another program as out@@ crop and inser@@ ting ( instead of copying and inser@@ ting ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost .
in the upper part of any text window there is the info @-@ line . the info @-@ line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ ename and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) Any info @-@ line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , you can rest the mouse over the line . then a small Help window will display the full name . )
the three source windows are the letters A , B and C . a color covers blue , B the color green and C is ma@@ gent@@ a . ( these preferences can be changed via the Settings menu . )
when a difference is detected , one sees the color which file differs . if both files differ , the default color is different . ( color for conflicts in settings ) . color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files . that &apos;s in the next section ( lead ) well .
links next to the text is the summar@@ izing column . if differences were found , the column displays the corresponding color . in some programming languages , the color is not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + , e.g. are white signs only in strings and commentary , relevant for pre@@ processor and in few , rare individual cases . )
the vertical line that separates the merging column from the text , is interrupted on the places where the respective source file has no lines . if the line is activated , the line is shown to be broken lines .
the result window ( among the compar@@ isons ) also has a info @-@ line with the wording output : , the fil@@ ename , and &#91; changed &#93; if you have edited the result . usually it contains the automatic merging already text , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are dissolved , the store is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons spr@@ ats to the next stem / un@@ resolved conflict in order to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two compar@@ isons are used , each distinction can also be solved at the same time a conflict which has to be solved manually .
through a click with the left mouse button in one of the windows that is highlighted to the line belonging group in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed . ( this will also be the current group . ) This group is highlighted the current group . it is highlighted with color background color for current area and each on the left appears a black beam .
sometimes through the automatic merge or by manual editing no further line will be left in the group ; then there is only a space holder for the event that you can change your mind and perhaps choose another source . this text does not appear in the final stored file , nor in a marker that you may copy and paste elsewhere .
the text &amp; lt ; summar@@ izing ; however , appears in the clip@@ board if you copy such text from the result window . go carefully with this function .
note : if when selecting the sources the options are ignore or ignor@@ ed@@ C / C + + comments are activated , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters .
navig@@ ating is navig@@ ated mainly with the image function and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard left , right , high , down , page , page , end , Str@@ g @-@ Start and Str@@ g end , Si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs . the excess column next to the vertical picture bar can also be used by clicking on the N@@ avi@@ d .
in the box you can also use the other buttons to edit . with the inser@@ tion button you can switch between inser@@ ting and over@@ load mode . ( default is the insert mode . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the summar@@ ies columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows on the beginning of each group ( as previously described in the section together and the edi@@ table output window ) .
the toolbar button contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ trl @-@ down / Str@@ g @-@ up ) , to the next / previous conflict ( roadmap ) or to the next / previous conflict , continue to be considered as a conflict . hence , there must be no conflict between deleted and un@@ resolved conflicts .
to copy the marker into the clip@@ board , you need to copy the Copy button ( C@@ trl @-@ C or C@@ trl @-@ inser@@ tion ) . however , there is also the option to automatically copy the copy button ( C@@ trl @-@ C or C@@ trl @-@ inser@@ tion ) . however , the option is automatically copied , automatically into the clip@@ board and copying manual copying . be careful with this option but you could not over@@ write the content of the clip@@ board .
c@@ eil@@ ers are stored in accordance with the underlying operating system . Unix @-@ versions use a line @-@ like mark \ , and Win@@ 32 @-@ based systems use wagon + Z@@ eil@@ en@@ vor@@ t \ \ r \ . K@@ diffusion 3 reserves the line of source files , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also do not use bin@@ ders files .
the options and the list of the recently used files will be automatically saved at the following start and restored at the next start . ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ diffusion 3 set up ... )
select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog sets with variable width to choose from , you should not use it . )
if you activate this option , differences are shown in cur@@ sive script . if the selected script does not support this representation , nothing happens at all .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in its pure form , but would be rec@@ ast@@ ed . on these systems , the button pres@@ ets automatically introduces a odd color .
when this option is activated , the corresponding number of space is inserted at the back of the table button . otherwise , a tab@@ ulator sign is inserted .
if you enter input or return , the inser@@ tion of the previous line will be automatically used for the next line .
when this option is activated , each selection will automatically be copied to the clip@@ board . the manual does not copy the clip@@ board into the clip@@ board .
you can select which line @-@ type you prefer to save . the value is the generally usual selection on the operating system used .
in the compar@@ isons of files tries &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first to find all completely identical lines in source files . only during this first step white signs can be ignored . the second step does not compare any line . in this step white signs are not ignored . also in the merging , white signs are not ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a wagon drop &apos; \ &apos; . usually ignored &amp; k@@ diff@@ use &apos; \ &apos; . usually ignored &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the car back@@ ups are visible , however , such as a white sign is treated . during the merging this option has to be de@@ activated . in default , this option is de@@ activated .
in default , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis are numbers and related characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; - &apos; ) . in the result the differences are still displayed , but they are treated like white signs .
in the default setting this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters .
intense after even smaller differences . the option is activated in default . it is effective for complicated and large files , but slowly with very large files .
the auto @-@ jump @-@ jump mode determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before the next un@@ solved conflict will continue .
dis@@ sol@@ ves automatic all conflicts in white signs by using the chosen file as a source . ( pres@@ et manual selection . ) This is useful when white signs in many files are less important . if you need it only from time to time , then use the automatic selection also conflicts in numbers or comments , if the options are ignore or ignor@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + comments .
these options are treated in the chapter for scanning of folders and transmis@@ sions . see for details on documentation for directory @-@ comparison and assemb@@ ling .
if a file is stored and already an older version exists , then the original version exists the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if there is already such a back@@ up@@ file with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup .
adap@@ ts the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the current running program . you need to stop and restart it . ( this option is active in the KDE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is globally adjusted via the control center . )
the following encoding settings can be adjusted separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the upper setting is used for all entries .
about the drop @-@ down fields for co@@ ding appears a short notice of what the local co@@ ding is . ( this can not be changed here and has purely informal nature . )
adjust the file encoding for source files . this influences how special characters treat and interpre@@ tations . since the encoding for each file is individually adjustable , even files can be compared and combined with different encoding .
if you have edited a file , you can choose which code to be used for saving .
if you define pre @-@ processing commands , they may not work with your co@@ de@@ c . ( e.g. , your files may be 16 @-@ bit ASCII , but the editor command can only be set with 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can specify the co@@ ding of the output of pre @-@ processor command .
turn off this to supp@@ ress up changes in white characters in the text or head@@ ings . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignore or ignor@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + comments . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all the differences between two of three files will be displayed . however , you might just want to see the differences between two of three files . according to the selection from A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C is displayed beside the normal still a second over@@ head column with the required information .
sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen rather for long lines . leaf simply type the less important window . ( this option is in the window @-@ menu . )
orders the comparative window in side or over each other . this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window @-@ menu . )
sometimes you consider the differences and then decide to merge the files together . a simple click starts merging and use the fil@@ ename of the last source file as prec@@ ari@@ ed name for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart the assemb@@ ling , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file it will be handed over to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command can be visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ processor that corresponds exactly your requirements . you can use this function e.g. to un@@ cut parts or correc@@ ting the ind@@ entation .
when reading a file it is handed over to this external command . if also a normal pre @-@ processor command is specified ( see above ) , then the output of the command is used only when selecting the previous command . you can write your own pre@@ processor that corresponds exactly your requirements . each entry line must have an associated issue line .
the idea behind it is to allow the user more flexibility when setting up the Di@@ ff results . but for this , an external program is needed , and most users do not want to program it yourself . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l completely sufficient .
use this pre @-@ processor command to convert the input into large letters : sed &apos; s / \ \ &apos; \ \ 1 / &apos; The . * is a erg@@ ul@@ ary expression of the text displayed on each string . the \ \ 1 is based on the found text in the first cl@@ am@@ mer@@ n@@ few . \ \ U turns the found text in big letters .
CV@@ S and other version control systems use some keywords to include automatically generated strings ( info : / c@@ vs / _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@
while you &apos;re going to experiment with sed , you might begin to understand it and maybe you like these regular expressions even . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
the ignor@@ ing of numbers is actually a built @-@ in function in K@@ diffusion 3 . but it is good as an example of a further pre @-@ driven command for Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ab@@ equals . sed &apos; s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Each sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a matches , and each matches is replaced with nothing , so practically er@@ ased .
sometimes you might want to perform several options at once . then you can use the Sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; use to separate the compositions of each other . example :
instead of sed , you can also use something other such as per@@ l use@@ . per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / replacement / switch &apos; aller@@ dings include in per@@ l some details differently . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs per@@ l only ( and ) without the &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data according to the normal pre@@ processor shall be maintained for viewing and bringing together . the further operations only change the data that the Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ab@@ equals @-@ Al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus .
note : in rare cases when you use a normal Pre@@ processor , the line @-@ in @-@ pre@@ processor sees the output of the normal pre @-@ processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function , the text changes or differences , you can not notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case .
often , programmers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason you can compare with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folder recur@@ sively compare and merge together .
... makes a suggestion for each object to create a proposal ; you can customize the proposal before the start ;
... can sim@@ ulate the merging and displays the sim@@ ulated changes without having to perform ,
... leads selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 button ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is similar to the same and merging of individual files very similar . you just have to specify folder on the command line or in the dialog file .
if three folders will be merged , folder 1 is used as a base . if no target folder was specified , used &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folder .
note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , do not start bringing together , you have to select the appropriate menu entry or press the F@@ 7 button . ( further details follow . )
while reading the folder you will find a small news window on the current progress . if you cancel the scanning of the folder , only the files are listed , which were compared to that .
when scanning the folder is complete , displays &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side , ...
each file and each folder found during the scan , is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is normally folded . you can double click on the + / - click on the object , or by clicking the arrow buttons on the left / right . the directory menu contains two functions All sub@@ directories , folders and all sub@@ directories with which you can set up all the folders .
when you double click on a file , the file will be started and it appears as a comparative window .
the symbol in the column Name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folder , then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case the contrac@@ ep@@ le action will not be automatically selected . if the merging of this is started , you will be informed about the problems of this kind .
as shown in the above picture , are used in the columns A / B / C the colours red , green , yellow and black .
with identical entries , the colour is also identical even if the age of the entries are different .
folders are considered identical if their entire content is identical . then you have the same color . with folders , the age is im@@ material to its color .
the idea for this colour scheme is based on dir@@ diff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf again , which is only green , then yellow and later when it is old , red becomes red .
... A and C are identical , but not B : copy from B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B identical , but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copy from A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A folder and B file is ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , the collapse can not be started .
... A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A folder and B file is ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , the collapse can not be started .
the mode for synchron@@ izing is active if only two folders and no explicit target folder were specified and when the option directories synchron@@ izing it . then cho@@ oses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action to be identical . if for an entry ...
... A and B exist , but not identical : perform and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees the visible fil@@ ename for the output file only B ; directly after the assemb@@ ling , copied &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
when two folders will be merged and the option new file will be selected instead of exec@@ uting ( uncertain ) , then the exact date appears , but the date is identical . if the files are different , but the date is identical . if such errors are not eliminated , the merging of the folders cannot be started .
during the merging , one file is working after another . it &apos;s status column shows he@@ ap when the merging was successful , and according to other messages when something in@@ expected occurred , you should make a final review and check if the status is in order .
when in the furniture dialog , the file is selected full analysis , K@@ diffusion will display more columns . these contain the number of odd , deleted , not wh@@ iter and white conflicts . ( the column for solved conflicts will only be displayed when three folders are compared or combined . )
you can either merge the straight selected entry ( file or Od@@ ner ) , or all entries are selected at once . if you have selected all the inter@@ tw@@ ater actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start the assemb@@ ling .
please note : if you have not specified a target folder , then the three @-@ folder @-@ assemb@@ ling mode will be used as the target , when two @-@ folder collapse , B is chosen as a target and used when synchron@@ isation is used A and / or B as a destination .
if you have selected a target folder , please check if all entries will be displayed in the target folder . there are some options that could be ski@@ pped in the folder structure . check out these options to avoid unnecessary surprises :
to merge all entries : select directory together / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cut ) . to run only the current record : select action of the current element or push F@@ 6 .
if through conflic@@ ting data types still exist even invalid acts , a message appears on the faul@@ ty elements . you can then select a valid action for them .
if you merge all entries , a dialog box will appear with the options , sim@@ ulate and break down .
select sim@@ ulate when you first want to see what would happen without which really changes . you will then get a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then execute certain actions with all entries . if a manual procedure is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then it opens up a merging window ( note the scre@@ enshot ) .
if you are finished with a file , select once again or press F@@ 7 . if you have not yet saved , a corresponding dialogue will appear . then you will continue working with the next entry .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; to make a mistake , appears a message and detailed status information . at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you to skip the cause of the problem . so you have the option to select another action for the entry or solve the problem in a different way before proceeding with the assemb@@ ling .
if some entries have been individually combined , you notice &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries are not saved again in the current session ) and execute them at the later date , these entries have been translated or not saved , these entries will be taken as being done . only if you change the merging action , these entries will again be merged .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ diffusion 3 setup ... ) has now a section called Invent@@ ory assemb@@ ling with these options :
only files that are fit to the specified pattern are displayed in the elementary tree . separate the patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; and valid Plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( such as * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . folders do not need to match this pattern .
files and folders in this pattern are not displayed in the elementary tree . it can be entered more than a pattern , use the Sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid Plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders in this pattern are not displayed in the elementary tree . it can be entered more than a pattern , use the Sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid Plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignored files that would also be ignored by CV@@ S . many autonomous files will be ignored by CV@@ S . the big advantage is that this folder specifically can be set with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see under info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some fil@@ es@@ et files , files have a plug@@ ged attribute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems marks a leading point . a file is hidden as hidden . this option allows you to decide whether these files are to be displayed in the elementary tree or not . this option is switched on in default .
for links to files : when the option is switched off , symbolic link@@ ages are compared . if the option is switched on , the files are compared to which the links show . this is disabled in the default .
if the option is switched off , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is switched off , the links will be treated like normal folders and re@@ port@@ edly checks on possible recur@@ ren@@ ditions . a link to a folder of a link to yourself will result in a final loop and cr@@ ush@@ ed . ) This option is switched off in default .
exec@@ utes a full analysis of each file and displays statistics columns . ( the total analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and substantially slower if they are applied to files that will not contain any text . ( specify an appropriate anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large folders over a slow network , it will possibly work faster , just change the date and file size . however , this speed is a degree of security . please use caution . this option is adjustable in default .
similar to confidential the change of issue . there will be no real comparison . the files are considered identical if they are identical in size . that can be useful for example when copying the chan@@ ges@@ tion issue is lost . please use caution . this option is adjustable in default .
activ@@ ates the synchronization mode when two folders are compared and no target folder was specified . in this mode , the proposals to the collapse you are identical . also the results of the merging of files are stored in both folders . this option is switched off in default .
if there are differences , will be suggested instead of the assemb@@ ling the newer file as action . ( this is considered in@@ secure , because it is assumed that the other file has not been changed . you should consider it in any case . ) This option is switched off in default .
if a file or folder will be replaced or deleted , then the original version will be ren@@ amed and the extension .@@ orig@@ ine extension already exists , then this will be deleted without further backup . this also concerns the normal cl@@ ashes of individual files , not just the merging of your files . this option is switched on in default .
normally , the folder @-@ merge view remains visible to the merging of single files ; you can switch the window parts using the mouse . if you don &apos;t want this , you can switch the window folder window in the window menu and switch from switch between directory &amp; text windows between the two views .
probably you prefer to compare a file simply by double @-@ clicking . nevertheless , there is also a corresponding menu entry . you can save a single file associated with the merge menu . once you save the result , the status will be done and the file will not be merged again when you launch the folder .
this status is lost however , if you read the directory again : directory menu : new to read
KDE supports network transparent with the help of K@@ IO @-@ slaves . K@@ diffusion 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders to open , which are located on local or remote computers .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on a FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as a local files and folders . a few things should note :
a path can be relative . or .. included . that is with URLs not possible , these are always absolute .
special characters must be mas@@ onry . ( # - &gt; % 23 , space line &gt; % 20 , etc . for example , has a file with the name / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes through the protocol . it follows a short list of constraints :
or it cannot be differ@@ ed whether a link indicates a file or folder . then always a file is accepted as a link target . ( FTP : , S@@ FTP : ) .
there is no way to edit authorization or change issue . therefore , the authorization or change of change from the original . ( note the option confidential the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files ) .

usually requires &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . however , if it is applied as a sound file , it adop@@ ts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the names of original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then start &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file .
in the context menu you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview . please note that this does not work if any of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable when the original files have changed since generating the patch file .
when &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part executed , it supports only the same of two files , a very small toolbar or menu . the merging or the same of folders will not be supported in the K@@ Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ diffusion 2 ( now He@@ ist are comp@@ are ) there already . in addition , the name K@@ diffusion 3 already indicates that it may result together as the program diff@@ use 3 from the Di@@ ff tool collection .
I use GPL @-@ programs already very long and have learned a lot by having seen in the sources of other programs . this is my thanks to all programmers who have gone this path or going to go so .
you have compiled the program from the sources , and the configure script will probably not find the correct pre@@ fix to KDE . in the default installed configure in / usr / local , but then KDE can not find the resources for the user interface ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find further information on this subject .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are first mentioned as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white signs is different , the line will be treated as not identical . if similar lines are going to be identical to each other , this hi@@ is the purpose this is the case .
the editor notes for each difference in the files where he starts and where it ends . however , this important information is simply lost if the result is simply saved as text file and it is much effort to design extra a private file format which could store this information .
the effort for this was so far too big . you can recover a certain version always by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger quantities of text , another editor should be used .
after removing text suddenly lt ; No sr@@ c lin@@ ts ; published and the text cannot be extingu@@ ished . what does that mean and how can it be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; used already many colors to highlight of differences . even more high@@ lighting would be confusing and lacking the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and fault reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to be able to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; KDE ; 3.1 or newer .
information on how to use K@@ diffusion 3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage .
you can find a list of recent changes under htt@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ log or in the file Ch@@ ange@@ log in the Qu@@ ell package .
to compile &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a system with &amp; KDE ; to compile and install , use the following command in the basic folder of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ Distribution :
KDE @-@ dir is the folder in your system where KDE is installed . if you are uns@@ ure , you will find further details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file .
since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and v@@ ein , you should not have any problems with comp@@ iling . should nevertheless difficulties occur , please report on the &amp; KDE ; -@@ Mail@@ ing@@ lists of it .
cut ( Str@@ g @-@ X or Um@@ sch@@ alt @-@ Rem@@ oval ) copies into the clip@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ trl @-@ V or en@@ sch@@ alt inser@@ tion ) adds the text from the clip@@ board at the current cursor position or replaces the current marking system .
only differences : files that are identical in all folders , do not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the target folder .
( in the current program version , you will have to update any changes to these options to read the folder with the function Update . )
there are only entries displayed , the differences are shown . if the target folder does not contain these files in the target folder . if the target folder does not already contain these files , they are not missing in a later program version . ( the behaviour will probably be off in a later program version . ) This option is switched off in default .
note the buttons to choose the source with the label A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines are displayed from the corresponding window to the end of the selected group on the result window ( if they are not already available ) . if the lines are already present , it will be removed when clicking on the button accordingly .
in the default setting this option is disabled . under@@ differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as variations in white characters .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager will show a thumb@@ nail of all virtual working spaces . it is quite handy to see the ongoing programs on the work@@ space to change their size , they stop or move it . this works both inside a desktop and several .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual work@@ spaces as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to other applications .
with the middle mouse button you can move windows within &amp; p@@ p@@ ager . the movement is possible both inside a desktop and on other work@@ spaces .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked on : if it is clicked on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; however , the context menu has only been clicked on an application within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; however , the symbol and the name of the application as well as the entries are minim@@ izing , maxim@@ izing , on desktop and respon@@ ds . the commands make the following :
maxim@@ izes the application window on the full size of the desktop . appears only if it was clicked on an application .
send the application to the selected virtual desktop . appears only if it was clicked on an application .
if this cross box is marked , windows within the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other work@@ spaces .
when this field is crossed , in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager , the names of virtual working spaces are shown .
cross this field leaves the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager : display the numbers of virtual work@@ space . is it together with name displayed , the names are provided with Ord@@ in@@ al@@ figures , &amp; eg ; 1st desktop .
when this field is crossed , the background of each desktop is also shown as background in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager .
when this field is crossed , the running programs are shown as small windows in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager . otherwise , only the empty spaces are displayed to make their selection .
here , the view of the program window will be selected . simply shows the window with its default symbol and Pix@@ map showing a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here , the arrangement of the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager will be determined : classi@@ cally leaves &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2@@ x@@ n @-@ push @-@ buttons , it shows all virtual work@@ spaces in a horizontal and vertical in a vertical line , which is very good for the presentation side on the desktop .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager Mini@@ Programme in the Control Panel . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , display the windows as icons , or with their content , and also runs outside the control panel .
click the right button of mouse inside of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; and subsequent selection from switches set up ... lets the dialog settings appear .
at the moment you do not change the dialog settings , but you can manually get this manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor , such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or VI@@ .@@ In case you do not have a typ@@ ist for the file , you must login to your system administrator or login to your system administrator . in this file you need to enter the key wind@@ ow@@ ment mode and to assign this one value . possible values are :
da &amp; k@@ p@@ ager is part of the package , you need a functioning installation of the KDE package .

in the default setting is magni@@ fied &amp; k@@ able ; the area around the mouse @-@ cursor such as a mobile magni@@ fier . alternatively , you can set up a selected screen area in the enlarge window ( selection window mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse cursor on the screen ( eg ; on the left side of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid that the mouse @-@ cursor is shown in the enlarged window , select the cursor mouse pointer . please note that this is still not able to recognize the form of the mouse cursor . this is always the standard KDE labels ; / Q@@ t ; mouse @-@ cursor .
in the selective mode , you can customize the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow keys and keys and change its size . this can be done in the following ways :
move the mouse pointer in the larger window and keep the left mouse button pressed , so you can catch the content of the enlarge window and move it . this also goes with the arrow keys .
if you are in addition the &amp; Shift , press or the &amp; M@@ MB ; use the selection window to be moved .
this combination allows you to change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the box is fixed and only the lower right corner is to move .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse @-@ click when the mouse pointer is preparing for a while at the same place . it is meant to help people who suffer from Re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ on In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) Syndrome and which each mouse @-@ click pain@@ s . furthermore , it may cause the drag with the mouse . however , this requires a little practice .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain being created by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you can also suffer from the mere limitations of your computer , you should seek a doctor if this has not yet happened .
to put it once again : even though &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pain@@ s avoid that are caused by clicking with the mouse , it is against pain that is caused by the loading of the mouse , useless . and as with all ergonomic assist@@ ants , the result can vary for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and carries a mouse @-@ click when you break the movement short .
is the smart gri@@ pping activ@@ ates , making &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a break after it runs the push of mouse button . now move the mouse , it is waiting until the end of the movement , before the slogan of the mouse button is executed . in this way , you can execute the drag @-@ button mouse button . in this way , you can perform the drag @-@ up mouse button . the smart amplifier requires a little practice , but you get used quickly to it .
this devast@@ ation must be du@@ red after the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse @-@ click .
is intelligent , enabled , the filming period is set ( 1 / 10 s ) . here , the time is adjusted , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after downloading the mouse button waiting , before it leaves the mouse button again , if the mouse button is done again .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; supports now the clicking on mouse @-@ shift . is this function activated , creates a slow flow due to the right and back , followed by a break , a click with the right mouse button . an lang@@ au@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ kes@@ .txt file is saved in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ bo@@ .txt file ; the first time is started , but they can be changed later .
when the sound is delayed , you can shor@@ ten the response time . open it to sound &amp; Multimedia , select the sound system and here the rider General . there is a sli@@ der Sound buffer to shor@@ ten you at a lower value to shor@@ ten the reply .
if this setting is marked , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is started . at every start of &amp; KDE ; this function is currently only under &amp; KDE ; available . with G@@ NO@@ ME or other shut@@ ters please tick the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically .
sets all the settings on the values that were adjusted when opening the dialog . have you already pushed the button to apply , the settings will be applied to the status after the final analysis of the dialog .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; initially using the pres@@ ets . especially the smart amplifier you should first be switched off at first . if you then click to the automatic mouse click , you can later take the smart amplifier .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it will be necessary to reduce the answers times of &amp; KDE ; in case of sounds .
first , you should be aware of which places a mouse click without effect will remain : the click on the neutral components of windows or on places in browser window that does not represent a link , does not lead to un@@ loaded reactions . you can therefore park the mouse on such places until you want them to use them again .
when your mouse ru@@ gged , you should clean your mouse . this is usually quite simple . the trick is that you can not only clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come in touch with the mouse ball .
first , you need to take the mouse ball out . as that happens , from mouse to mouse is different . however , it should be quickly clear when you look at the bottom of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the roles . these are located on the sides of the hole where the ball was used . dirt and dirt can easily be scr@@ apped with a flat blade or the finger .
in very rare situations the operating system breaks off the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you &apos;re just going to use the smart amplifier , this means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool means that this operation can no longer end by the slogan of the mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to use another window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you can run for yourself a mouse @-@ click . here is the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; reset and you can continue as usual .
problem : if you enter text , tries &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to run mouse clicks and continue the cursor to another place .
solution : use the mouse to place the cursor to the cursor where you want to have it . but you can no longer guide the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop , if you want to create a keyboard short@@ cut . secure zones for the mouse @-@ cursor are w@@ rench . secure zones for the mouse @-@ cursor are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the toolbar and menus and the theme lines of windows .
I try to work with the intelligent waste , but I don &apos;t manage to edit the text .
the smart reloc@@ ating is a advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes his time before you handle it . it is very well possible to copy it into the clip@@ board and move again or execute any other action to move it into the clip@@ board . but it will probably first prepare them problems . here are some advice on this :
use the smart exp@@ ulsion not if you just start using &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; select text instead as follows : do you move at the end of the text field a mouse click and keep the switching button pressed while you move the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and again hit the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mouse @-@ click . this is every time when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button presses a sound like a mouse @-@ click . so you know exactly when with the intelligent reference it begins . later you can use the smart amplifier even without the audi@@ ble mouse click . however , it requires some exercise .
to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to be able to use the X@@ test extension for &amp; X Window ; this should be the case in most systems .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available if the system has a sound card and speaker and can be set up correctly .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; bet@@ s the mouse button once the mouse @-@ cursor is short . this program was developed for people who suffer from the R@@ SI syndrome and which the lin@@ t of the mul@@ sta@@ est pain@@ s are prepared .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured to be configured it is a certain time waiting that a gyp@@ sies process begins before the mouse button is loos@@ ed . in this way can also drag and dra@@ gging with the mouse .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program with which mu@@ te users can let their computer speak for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; mu@@ te users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the talk of the words that should be spoken again .
on the first page of the wizard ( lin@@ kes scre@@ enshot ) enter the command that will be used later for the translation of text . further details can be found in the description of the furniture .
on the second page you can choose the default text@@ book . from the text@@ books you can often choose text passages without typ@@ ing them . the passages can be edited naturally .
on the third page ( right scre@@ enshot ) determine the dictionary for the words of words . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the KDE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of the individual words . additionally , you can copy the list of words with an Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly letter words are taken into the words of words .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clearly arranged and contains essentially an input field for the ke@@ ystro@@ kes of your propositions ( the lower white field in the scre@@ enshot ) and a reference memory of the already spoken phrases ( the upper white field in the scre@@ enshot ) .
if you have k@@ mouth correctly , you can enter into the input field the propositions you want to hear . each spoken set is attached to the publisher . you can select from it that should be spoken again .
with the menu entry Settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the entry dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth . this dialog contains two card cards , voice output and settings , the page Vor@@ ter@@ rier and the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service .
in the input field of the map card , enter the command to the call of the language generator . in the box under the input field you put the string to be shared with the text to the voice generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two types to pass the text . choose the cross @-@ box when the text is to be passed on to the language generator .
if the cross box is not selected , the text is passed as parameters . you can use the following space holder :
of course , the command to the voice output depends on your language generator . this command can be found in the documentation for your language generator . examples of this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x .
with as possible to use as voice service &amp; k@@ mouth ; as the first try to pass the text on this page . the kt@@ ts@@ d language service is a &amp; KDE ; -@@ D@@ äm@@ on , the &amp; KDE ; uses a standardized interface for voice output and which is currently being developed in SV@@ N . choosing this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection field action after selecting a text passage , determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by choosing a text passage in the menu text@@ book or in the box for text@@ books .
with the selection of So@@ fort , the chosen text passage is directly spoken and additionally inserted into the box . with the selection of In the input field , the selected text passage is initially entered only into the input field .
with the second selection panel closing the editing window for text@@ books you can specify , whether the text@@ book will be automatically saved at the closing of the editing window .
with the selection of text@@ books save the book will be saved . if you select any changes , the text@@ book will not be saved . select Be@@ mouth , ask if the text@@ book is to be saved .
the page Vor@@ ter@@ tran@@ sit@@ ing contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the words of words . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box when this list contains more than a dictionary . with this selection , you can choose the dictionary used to be used for words .
with buttons right on the page you can delete dic@@ tion@@ aries or add the order of books , or export them into a file . below the list you can adjust the name and the selection panel for the dictionary .
select the desired language for this source ; &amp; k@@ mouth , then reads the &amp; KDE ; documentation . the frequency of the individual words is determined simply by the count of occurrence . additionally , you can compare the list of words with an Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary to include only properly described words into the new dictionary .
with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth , then asks , which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how that can be weigh@@ ted .
with this option you put a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly entered words automatically adds into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary over time .
the main area of the window for processing text@@ books is divided into two . in the upper part , the text@@ books are presented as tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the associated key@@ note . if you have selected a text@@ book , you can only change its name .
actions like new text passages or books add or delete selected text passages and books , either by selecting the menu bar , in the toolbar or via a folding menu .
the order of text@@ books or text passages can be changed by drag the mouse to the new location or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; button .
the selected text is cut out and copied into the clip@@ board . if in the input field is selected a text section , this is used , otherwise the selected areas of the exp@@ atri@@ ation .
the selected text is copied into the clip@@ board . if in the input field is selected a text section , this is used , otherwise the selected areas of the repository .
the currently active sentence is spoken . if text is in the input field , this is used , otherwise the selected sentences of the exp@@ ires .
if this menu item is merged with buttons for frequently used commands . the toolbar can be arranged by default via the editing window directly under the menu bar . by mouse @-@ click on the sound@@ ing left side and drag the toolbar can be moved to another place .
if this menu item is crossed , a narrow body is shown in the lower part of the main window with hints about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed when not crossed , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is crossed , a ver@@ sible Bar is displayed for text@@ books using entries . by mouse @-@ click on the sound@@ ing left side and drag the toolbar can be moved to another place .
probably you have not entered the command for the language release properly or not completely entered . open Settings k@@ mouth ; setup the page Universal Settings and enter the command for voice output on the map card statement .

to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the folder / usr / local / fre@@ et . language output is then possible with one of the three following command examples :
for the third example the option has to send data as standard input . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a voice generator for many languages . it conver@@ ts a list of ph@@ on@@ gs into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to use the text in Ph@@ on@@ eme . the license permits it to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text in Ph@@ on@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA , taking note that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / mb@@ ro@@ la .
unfortunately H@@ adi@@ fax is happy to be the last character of the text , so that an additional character has to be added . the complete command is therefore elaborate than in the other examples :
( Cat - ; echo ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / kan@@ ro@@ la / usr / local / mb@@ ro@@ la / dev / local / mb@@ ro@@ la / de@@ 1 / dev / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; art@@ ou@@ ay / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written into one line . the option is to send data as default .
the Spe@@ dition @-@ D@@ äm@@ on of &amp; KDE ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; KDE ; further language service , which provides a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different voice output systems .
as the setting of the language @-@ generator occurs only in the c@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth .
to set the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service , which appears in the setup dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; successfully to use , you need a voice generator ( and of course &amp; KDE ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; needs approximately 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for the voice generator ) , but it depends on the individual of your computer and its configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application with the people who cannot speak , text through the computer . it is stored a list already sc@@ anned sets that can always be re@@ handed over again .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no voice syn@@ thesizer . on the machine must be a voice syn@@ thesizer .
detailed user documentation can be found with help : / k@@ mouth ( enter either this URL in the address bar by &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; one or start your help@@ center help : / k@@ mouth ) .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; - the voice output system of &amp; KDE ; - is one out of the modules of existing service , which allows every application to read text via the &amp; D@@ Bus ; interface .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; is a sub@@ system in &amp; KDE ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; KDE ; programmer ready to be equipped with which their applications can be equipped with T@@ TS skills . also the users offers interesting options .

marriage you &amp; kt@@ ts ; you may need to install program Spe@@ ech disp@@ at@@ cher and set it correctly . see also
at the first start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ g@@ r or as long as no speaker are set up , the cart@@ oons card will be shown . see also . if you have set at least one speaker , the cart@@ ography card will be displayed . see .
most T@@ TS @-@ Syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , such as different male or female , or those that refers to volume or speed . you can also use multiple variants for a syn@@ thesizer . they should have at least one speaker before you &amp; kt@@ ts ; use as the program speed disp@@ at@@ cher otherwise uses the standard speaker .
different speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable to several printing inks for the same printer .
if you click on the cart@@ els of cart@@ els in kt@@ t@@ sm@@ g@@ r , the cart@@ oons card will appear automatically when you start @-@ t@@ sm@@ g@@ r and no speaker is set up .
all the already furnished speaker will appear in this list . the preferred speaker appear on the top in the list . the number of speaker is used for voice output when an application is not present@@ er .
select a spokes@@ man from the list and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
select a spokes@@ man from the list and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
select a spokes@@ man from the list and click on this button to move the speaker in the list a line further down . the order of the speakers in the list determines their priority .
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ts ; system to apply .
select a mo@@ ods here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a jun@@ k voice to choose from .
if you click here , appears on the new speaker at the Card speaker . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; already almost use it . go back to the map card and check if S@@ TS @-@ Service from &amp; KDE . see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; use to read text . click on the map orders to create text orders and manage . see .
if you have set up at least one speaker , you can start the language system of &amp; KDE . click on the map @-@ map to open these cards . here you can set some general options .
select this landing field to activate the &amp; kt@@ ts ; this starts successfully , the cart@@ on card will be displayed and you can create text contracts and read reviews . see . remove the markings , c@@ TT@@ SD will stop and the T@@ TS @-@ System of &amp; KDE ; de@@ activated .
if kt@@ t@@ sm@@ g@@ r is finished , runs &amp; kt@@ ts ; continue , if the field is de@@ activated ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
if this cat@@ ching field is marked and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ g@@ r appears to read automatically in the system field of the control bar , it disappears once the pre @-@ read has been completed .
with the buttons in this series you can start text orders , stop , stop and resume .
with the buttons in this series you can read the current text in the &amp; KDE ; clip@@ board or read a text file to read . you can also switch the speaker for a job .
click on or OK , then all changed settings will be taken on all pages .
the map card is only displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD has been started . to launch K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the map @-@ on @-@ map and activate this language version ( C@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; KDE ; , you can read the text of the displayed web page . check first if you want to read it . then select the text you want to read , and select the text menu text . after a short time the voice should start .
it is almost always advisable to highlight the desired text of a website . you can also skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; pres@@ criptions and other invisible brands are also read .
in &amp; K@@ ate ; the expanded text editor of &amp; KDE ; , you can read the text here . check first if you want to read it . then select the text you want to read , and select the text menu text . then the language version should begin .
this also works , if &amp; K@@ ate ; in other applications is embedded , as &amp; eg ; in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; qu@@ anta ;

filter for drawing chain composition provide a good opportunity in &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is a good example . you remove the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by email , and also the expression / local / In@@ box since this can be accepted in most cases as provided .
filter are one of the advanced abilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal working with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filter is not required .
filtering text will be edited , before it becomes sent to the program Spe@@ ech disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for improving pron@@ unci@@ ation to select false words or abbreviations , to select a suitable language and speaker , or to deal with certain shortcomings of voice syn@@ thesizer and their voices .
to understand the working method of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; Spe@@ ech disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distingu@@ ishes four types of texts .
the edition of Screen Re@@ a@@ ws has the highest priority . it will be prec@@ eded to all other orders and keeps these orders . if the edition of the screen reader has been read , the orders are continued again .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is becoming hot reserved . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are continued after the issue of warning .
News have the next highest priority . a message breaks normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses news . while you want to read a long text on a website , you can see with &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone who just enter the room . &amp; KDE ; messages are also messages . read on this .
the rest are simple text orders . each order that you encounter from the map card is a text contract . K@@ Say@@ it is an example of an application that uses text contracts . text contracts are thought for the output of longer texts that do not have special ur@@ gency .
all four orders are lab@@ eled in queue , except for the issue of screen regul@@ ators . if an application sends the output of a screen report , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just such a pre @-@ read , this issue will stop and ended .
first you need to know that filters will never be applied to the output of screen revisions . you will be applied to normal warnings , messages and text contracts as well as on &amp; KDE ; -@@ News .
filter by the text and enter it on the next filter . at the moment there are three types of filters .
filters are carried out as modules . in the future , there are still further types of filters .
string qu@@ ad can replace parts of a text by other text . the refer@@ ral pieces can be supplied either as words or as a regular expressions . it is supplied with pre@@ defined strings ( e.g. : - ) by text or for the form@@ atting of messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better intel@@ li@@ gible form .
&amp; XML ; re@@ former use a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format into another format . in the scope of &amp; kt@@ ts ; some X@@ SL@@ T files are included in the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML .
with speaking optional filters , you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that send the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; if you have used for example on the cart@@ els speaker to read a female voice , you can read text of KDE messages about it . Si@@ eh@@ e. read about it .
each of these different filters are adjustable rules , according to which it is applied to a voice output . if the filter suggests that his rules does not apply , he returns the text unchanged to the next filter .
if a text message , a message , warning or a &amp; KDE ; -@@ notification to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent , it will be edited through all activated filters listed on the page below . processing by the filters are performed in the order from top to bottom .
this displays the list of the furnished normal filters . if a filter is not crossed , it is not activated and is not used . filter are removed from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and it will be shown below the following furniture dialog .
for setting up strings , you must enter a list of words or regular expressions as a reference pattern . these patterns will be found in the text , then the text will be exchanged for the associated replacement text . large - and sp@@ read@@ ings will not be noticed when compared .
enter a name for your filter . this name you can choose any number , it must be distinguished only by the name of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column , and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column . the list is displayed in the order from top to bottom .
click here to move the marked word or the regular expression in the list .
with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expressions out of a file that list current list or delete a list from a file , the entries will be displayed from the file to the existing list .
here is a language registered , the filter is only applied to display a list of languages listed here . click on the button to display a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you click the &amp; C@@ trl ; button pressed .
if a value is registered , the filter is only applied if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application ID @-@ run programs can be obtained with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; D@@ Bus ; numbers , you have to we@@ dge you . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID Cop@@ per @-@ 34@@ 32 indicates , you may only enter .
the filter reduction filter is only applied to the text , if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filters when match . are all input fields blank , the filter is applied to all texts .
in comparison of words the string module has regular expressions in form \ \ s word \ \ . the words must therefore be limited by separ@@ ator ( spaces ) .
in this manual you will find no instructions for writing regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; KDE ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular expressions , you can call it in the di@@ alogs add or edit any help to the merging of these expressions . the &amp; KDE ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expressions can be found in the package .
&amp; XML ; S@@ form@@ ers translate &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SL@@ T files from a format into another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such re@@ formats . however , it can only be applied to well @-@ shaped XML . the auxiliary program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c must be installed on your system .
enter the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the ambient variable PA@@ TH is also enough x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
with the speaker filter , you can send texts to a specific speaker , which is placed on the cart@@ els speaker , or to a speaker with specific properties . you can choose for example that texts by k@@ mail can be read by a female voice . see .
before &amp; kt@@ ts ; add a text to the filter , there is a spokes@@ man for the text . the speaker is selected based on the speaker properties that sends the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sending the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; send the speaker line with speaker line filters can over@@ write the chosen speaker .
if a value is registered , the filter is applied in case the text contains the specified regular expression . is installed on your system of &amp; KDE ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; expressions , you can call it by clicking on the button to get help with the input .
to achieve a faster finish , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DA@@ TA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
place here the properties of the desired filters . if the text displayed the above filter conditions , the speaker will be selected , which matches the desired requirements . click on the button on the right to view the dialog box .
use these buttons to store or load your speaker settings , or to delete all settings .
the speaker filters will only be applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filters if you need to apply at least one condition .
the voice output API , from &amp; KDE ; to give the programmer their applications T@@ TS skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; D@@ bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the voice syn@@ thesizer to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD so that &amp; kt@@ ts ; this syn@@ thesizer can use .
the following section contains a brief description of the &amp; KDE ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; interface of the language version API from &amp; KDE ; the complete documentation for both APIs , please refer to the KDE ; Acces@@ sibility website ( htt@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .

here is text of the text to the read and option to read a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are even more commands you can use . for a list of all orders you give

none of the mentioned language syn@@ thesizer supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have set the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; re @-@ form@@ atted filter , but when using the module for festival websites are not read @-@ in .
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you must install the ( male British ) voice of Rab _ di@@ phone , so that SA@@ BLE does not work at all . that &apos;s why you don &apos;t have to use this voice to read websites . also ensure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c installed and can be found via the ambient variable PA@@ TH .
certain signs or interference mark appear to cause mistakes in the syn@@ thesizer , so that entire propositions will be issued or only gi@@ fted @-@ cat@@ fish . what can I do against it ?
first , make sure that the option character co@@ ding is adjusted to the right value for the corresponding language . there are problems with certain signs or words , these may be fixed by a string carrier filter . see .

the voice syn@@ thesizer that are used by &amp; kt@@ ts ; have their own license which you will find in the associated documentation or on the relevant websites . there are also voices that have their own license .
if you have access to the KDE source archive , you can download the package with &amp; kt@@ ts ; from it . &amp; kt@@ ts ; find the source code of k@@ de@@ fi@@ r under ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / KDE / .
contains many languages , a list of all currently supported languages can be found on the htt@@ p page : / / es@@ pe@@ ak@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / langu@@ ag@@ es.@@ html .

K@@ T@@ TS works with each voice syn@@ thesizer , which can be started on the command line in a &amp; console ;
the list of the above languages can be incomplete or outdated . hence , follow the description of syn@@ thesizer to the supported languages at rate . also take a look at the website of kt@@ ts ; , according to information that are not yet included in this manual .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spe@@ ech @-@ Disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; program uses a adaptable module architecture for voice syn@@ thesizer . if you want to extend it for the use of another syn@@ thesizer , please contact the developer team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; transformation filter is not necessarily necessary . Debian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
to compile &amp; kt@@ ts ; you need a current development environment of KDE ( version 3.4 or new ) including the packages of k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the program &quot; Spe@@ ech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot;
if you have the source code of &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source archive for k@@ de@@ ers , or downloaded the program here , you have downloaded and install the program with the following commands :
before you &amp; kt@@ ts ; use , check first if Spe@@ ech disp@@ at@@ cher is working correctly with your voice syn@@ thesizer . for this you can use the Sh@@ ell@@ script SPD conf .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; KDE ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ g@@ r should be developed so further that the establishment of Spe@@ ech disp@@ at@@ cher is directly possible and the SD@@ P conf file is no longer needed .
a long text is dis@@ semb@@ led into individual sentences . the user can leave sales or decrease off , repeat the output or break down .
if an application is text on &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can request an application for example a female English speaker . if you have chosen one speaker , whose language English and its sex is female , this one will automatically choose the best fitting speaker . if you want to know more about it , how &amp; kt@@ ts ; a spokes@@ man cho@@ oses , take a look at .
if you click on the map card , click Add to add a spokes@@ man to the list or click on Edi@@ ting , the Card tab is shown in the list . for example , the layout of the module for Festival Interactive will be shown . details on the modules can be found under .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival programme . if the path to Festival is contained in PA@@ TH , you only have to enter the festival .
select the character co@@ ding for text , which is handed over to the festival . if voices , the &amp; kt@@ ts are automatically made , this setting is automatically made . generally applies that Western languages ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 use , in @-@ eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ ders , you make loud@@ speaker , speaking speed and pitch in synthetic language . if you cannot select some regul@@ ators and displayed this grey , the voice chosen will not be chosen by you .
some voices such as multi@@ Sy@@ n voices need to be loaded multiple seconds due to their size . if you select this cross @-@ box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD so that ( for greatest memory consumption ) the first set is syn@@ thes@@ ized .
if this cross @-@ box cannot be selected , you do not yet have any speaker ( or forget to apply ) . see .
if this cat@@ ching field is marked , is shown at the start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ g@@ r . otherwise , after starting only the icon is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to view the program window .
if this cat@@ tery is marked and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ g@@ r does not exp@@ ire , it appears in the system area , once K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . this gives you the possibility to read or to control it otherwise .
here are all orders listed in queue , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the contract , the number of propositions and the straight set . the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the cart@@ on tab .
with the buttons in this series you can jump off in the order that is selected in the list below , or go back . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) .
with a click on OK , all changes of settings ( also taken over the other cards ) and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ g@@ r will be res@@ ized to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to view the program window again .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead , AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the map audio . see also .
here are only text assignments performed and administr@@ ated . issues of screen revisions , warnings and messages are not displayed . more information about the communication types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in .
select the type of audio output . if a component can not be selected , &amp; kt@@ ts ; either without support for the corresponding Audi@@ om@@ o@@ du@@ l or &amp; kt@@ ts ; may not load the necessary libraries .
if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Co@@ de is to be used for audio output , select the audio output . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you need to install at least one module . have AL@@ SA selected , select the PC@@ M device . see also
set the microphone speed here . 50@@ n@@ bsp ; % corresponds to about half and 200@@ n@@ bsp ; % about the double normal microphone speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed .
click to apply the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ts ; system to take over .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you must find out which machine works with you . in doubt you choose standard .
on this map card , you can set up special actions that will always be executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processed four types of voice contracts :
the edition of Screen Re@@ a@@ ws has the highest priority . it will be prec@@ eded to all other orders and keeps these orders . after the edition of the screen reader has been read , the requested orders are res@@ umed .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is becoming hot reserved . a warning holds the output of messages and normal text . these orders are continued after the warning of warning .
News have the next priority . a message breaks normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application to read the messages . if you want to read just a long text on a website , you can welcome you with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone welcome you straight into the room .
if a text message is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen Re@@ aders , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output in queue .
this audio file is always played when a normal text message is interrupted . if both introductory sound and introductory message is active , the introductory sound is played before the introductory message .
the settings on this map card apply only for normal text contracts . for messages , warnings and expenses of screen revisions are no special promotions , if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority .
to read by &amp; kt@@ ts ; K@@ No@@ tify messages can be read , start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ g@@ r and click noti@@ fications . the map card notices appears .
select this landing field to switch the pre @-@ read of &amp; KDE ; -@@ disadvantage . if this setting is not marked , the remaining settings are disabled and &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads no noti@@ fications before .
if this setting is marked , al@@ erts when a sound is ab@@ used , of &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read .
use these buttons to add events to list or delete it . if you click on the Add button , a dialog box appears in which you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message before , the &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; sent when someone mentioned in an I@@ RC message your nick@@ name .
all the events that have nothing else in the list are provided by &amp; kt@@ ts ; ignored .
use this array to define what &amp; kt@@ ts shall do when an event starts . you have the following selections :
if you have chosen user defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following space holder :
you can enter here the properties of the desired speaker . standard sel@@ ects the speaker , which is displayed in the list on the map tab as the top entry . see this also .
note that there are three levels for events . if a specific event is specified for events . otherwise the action is carried out for all other events of the particular application . as the last option comes the action to wearing , which was laid under standard ( all other events ) .

the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to highlight text for a voice output . this standard includes brands for control of voices , the volume speed , the volume , sex voice and pitch . also marks for control of the pron@@ unci@@ ation of e.g. abbreviations . SS@@ ML is a part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard .
currently supported &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in the basic functions . the following restrictions are present :
you need to install the Rab _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) because this is the default voice that is used at the SS@@ ML output .
if the settings for speed or pitch is not mounted on 100@@ n@@ bsp ; % is usually spoken , SS@@ ML text is usually very mon@@ oton@@ ous .

there are two types of filters - normal filter and typ@@ ing filters ( SD@@ S@@ s ) . SB@@ Ds may start using text in individual sentences . therefore , you can also read or stop the entire text order . thus , you can also stop or stop on the map card orders , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer this does not directly support .
here you can see the pro@@ posi@@ bility filter filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts ; is automatically set up a pro@@ posi@@ tional filter filter automatically . you can change its settings or add other pro@@ posi@@ tional filters , beginners will not get out of it .
on the easiest way you can learn the setting of the speaker selection , choose the speaker option and select text to read . check out the speaker ticket orders , which speaker &amp; kt@@ ts ; choose the speaker option again , change some properties and check how the selection of the speakers have changed , otherwise you need to have more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; then start with the pre @-@ read , as only the first sentence must be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long ,
you can stop text assignments then on the map card or cancel , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer this function does not support .
for these reasons the normal typ@@ ing limit@@ er filter is automatically set up , if you start @-@ t@@ sm@@ g@@ r for the first time . it cannot be switched off , just remove . change anything about this filter , unless you know what you are doing .
typ@@ ing filters compare text with a regular expression for pro@@ posi@@ tional and add a tabl@@ ature sign ( dec@@ imal code 8 ) at the typ@@ ing borders ( dec@@ imal code ) ( dec@@ imal code ) automatically removed from the text ) . note that the default limit@@ er filter filter is attached the drawing .
SB@@ D filters will never be applied to &amp; KDE ; News ( k@@ iller ) , warnings , messages or the output of screen @-@ re@@ funds .
if you have removed from understanding the normal typ@@ ing filters , you can insert this once again by loading the file standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c .
on the map card , you can write the speaker settings for the application . the map card is displayed when
use of the standard speaker ( the top one on the cart@@ els speaker ) . in other words , there are no speaker properties .
use of the most appropriate speaker , which shows all the properties of a furnished speaker . if you do not delete or edit the settings of the speaker , cho@@ oses &amp; kt@@ ts ; this speaker . otherwise , cho@@ oses &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker from who most sought after the original features .
select the method to enter the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
select the properties of the desired microphone . if this property does not play a role , do not give anything else .
select this landing field when the property is to have preced@@ ence over other properties . you can also set several mark@@ ers here .
since the language is a critical factor in understanding the output , it is always treated as a priority feature . you will use this property rarely . the only case where you may wish to specify the attribute language , is ahead if you know that a certain application text is sent in a different language than that in the working environment .
to use all properties in the range of speaker , who corresponds to the following corresponds to the button default , click on the selection button and then use the speaker , which corresponds to the following .
in this case it is 0 for the last text order in queue . you can also specify a order number ( no order number is required input 0 ) .

the audio output about AL@@ SA does not work when I play with another application music at the same time . if I stop a text message , free@@ zes &amp; kt@@ ts ; a message appears on the &amp; console ; appears a message that said to open PC@@ M .

I have loaded one extra voice for festival out of the internet . I have installed them and can use them at festival , but kt@@ t@@ sm@@ g@@ r shows that voice not .
add in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / Cal@@ int / Vo@@ ices . as a guide you can serve the other entries . if this is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL that you have found the voice to the developers .
on the map audio there is a setting speed . so this works , the program must be installed and installed over the ambient variable PA@@ TH . some Syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ er@@ mod@@ ul@@ s such as Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed . depending on the chosen voice this is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the microphone velocity are ignored if &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; pre@@ reads that the HTML is controlled in SS@@ ML .

Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thesizer , whose source code is obvious . the quality of the votes is generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported . with many voices you can volume , speaking speed and pitch with &amp; ct@@ ts ; set .
you must install at least one language . help in the tutorials that are supplied with Festival . would you like to read web pages , you must install the ( male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone .
for these voices , you have to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on the transfer .
this voice uses Festival 1,@@ 95 beta or later . the voice is still in an early stage @-@ stage . if you set up the Russian voices , you must enter for the voices ms@@ u _ ru _ n@@ sh _ di@@ phone . select a cy@@ ri@@ ll@@ ian ( 8 @-@ bit ) co@@ ding like for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux . search the festival as first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the co@@ ding option has to be adjusted to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding must be set to an 8 @-@ bit Ky@@ ri@@ ll@@ era as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival can be used together with the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; syn@@ thesizer takes place the le@@ xi@@ cal analysis and &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; it generates the audio output . the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; program and the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; voices can be downloaded from

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center , enabling the management of network interfaces , routine and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a range of system and desktop settings for a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be accessed by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; be called ..
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was developed to enable users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ station ; create a simple surface for the user :
after installation , a new module network settings in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center is displayed . the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting a k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network network settings in &amp; k@@ menu .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers must already be functional and configured to allow &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf : the device at all indicates and the setting of network features enables .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed by installing &amp; Linux ; with installed and furnished , network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded through adjusting the following files , according to the kernel version .
the module network settings will be loaded when the network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ index is selected . at the starting of the module network settings , this , the platform used on the system automatically detect .
if the platform can not be detected , the hanging choice is offered . it is the platform from the list to select the distribution and the releas@@ ers at the best . by selecting the setting non @-@ again queries , the definition can be made permanently . at the next start of the network settings then this selection will be automatically pres@@ et .
the change of network settings is possible only in system administration mode . previously all options are displayed , what means , the settings can only be viewed . in the system administration mode , you will be able to change the system administration mode at the right bottom of the module . it is necessary to enter the password .
in the system administration mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . it is divided into three tab@@ s :
the tab network interfaces for the management of the network equipment of the system . all available network devices are shown . from the tab network interfaces can be performed as follows :
the configur@@ able network interfaces can be set by selecting the desired device in the list and click of the button and click the button in the dialog device .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click on the button and displays the dialog with further options .
with the selection Autom@@ atically , the TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched by a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . the D@@ H@@ CP@@ D or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends out all required TCP / IP address . therefore , no further adjustment is required . in the selection list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be selected according to the system .
with the selection Manual may be made without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP the TCP / IP address . in the input field IP address , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . in the input field network mask is to set the sub @-@ network .
if this setting is marked , the system initi@@ ates the network interface when boats . if the initi@@ alization is not desirable , this option should not be activated .
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as the properties of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; console ; you can determine whether the desired address is already in use . in doubt the network administrator must be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched off , depending on your needs , and on the activated network , it is done by selecting the list and clicking the interface .
network devices can be activated or switched off , depending on your needs . turn on a activated network place by selecting from the list and clicking the interface .
sets the IP address of the computer in the local sub@@ net , which convey@@ s the physical connection to remote networks and is used as standard for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ networks .
if available on computer more than one network interface , the interface must be selected to the net in which the gateway computer is to be selected .
a computer with DNS support replaces a full domain name by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only address IP addresses . if the computer htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org does not resolve this name to an IP address like 12@@ 3,@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the computer for attri@@ bution @-@ up part of the equ@@ ator tag allows easy management of this list . entries may be added , removed or modified wer@@ .@@ DNS entries can be ordered by selecting an entry and up or down@@ gra@@ dation in the list with buttons , or set up in the top priority .
by clicking the button of the button , adding a DNS server can be added to a DNS server . it will add the New Nam@@ er@@ ver dialog .
first , you must enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry will then be inserted in the list .
from the group computer to naming solution , select a entry and then click the Edit button . it will be shown in the dialog box .
the list of the well @-@ known calcul@@ ators describes the name @-@ to @-@ IP address for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used for boats when no DNS server is available . in small , inter@@ connected networks can replace it a DNS server .
normally , the list contains more known calcul@@ ators , some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses support . this is still in the test to replace the version of IP should be replaced in the future version 4 .
enter the IP address of the well @-@ known computer and click Add .... The dialog of New Ali@@ as will be displayed .
enter the name of the known machine and click the Add button . if the known machine has multiple alias names , de button adding several times , and enter the other alias @-@ name .
select an entry of a specified host from the list and select Edit .... to edit the dialog &apos;s computer .
it can be one of the following tasks to run , then by clicking OK the list of static hosts is updated .
the settings made in the module settings are not immediately available in the system . to enable the changes , must be set in a &amp; console ; the following command must be set .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net you can download the latest version of the source code .
for the installation of binary distribu@@ tions ( mostly rpm packages ) it is enough if they are installed and Q@@ t installed .
the installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users . it is simply the rpm package to download and install in one &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a tool can be used with a graphical surface like a package or the installation tool of their distribution .
for this case the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; KDE ; not , but additionally , the development packages with libraries and other things are required .
this will only be recommended by experienced users . however , it is not difficult , &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf : to compile the following commands should do this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information on basic network technology will be given , in the second all are discussed by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; changing configuration files .
this area may not replace further knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x only basic information on the integration of the PC is convey@@ ed into a small ( home ) network .
currently , IP networks run with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) has never found large distribution . by IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected that it continues in the near future . this description focuses on the widespread IP@@ v@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is to assign the IP address of a network interface . in alien networks , on &amp; eg ; workplace is the network administrator the contact point , which is a valid IP address or if available , D@@ H@@ CP can not be chosen as desired .
when setting up a separate small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a special request for this purpose to avoid IP address conflict with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwarded to the Internet , so their arbitrary use is possible .
of course , access to the internet for such machines can be made by setting up a gat@@ ew@@ ays .
for smaller networks are mostly addresses in the area of 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 . the area is large for networks up to 250 computers large enough .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually placed on 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all machines are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.@@ 0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the Zwe@@ ite the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own computer ) . the default route is required for IP forwarding .
the net@@ address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP @-@ traffic in the local own machine . normally the address is assigned to 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 of its own so called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works as a closed circle .
this part is the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf : and where they are stored in the different distribu@@ tions .
this file is sometimes dynamically changed at DSL connections , so that it will not be surprised if in the case of active DSL connections , another content is defined as set there .
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; is known that this file is not sorted by the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another stand as expected can therefore occur .

to change a variable , select first the variable variable . go then to Edit Chang@@ ing .... alternative to click the variable and change ... select , or you press C@@ trl ; O .@@ It will then be able to edit the dialog variables , in which you can edit the variable , in which you can edit the variable .
to delete an ambient variable , select first the variable . go to Edit Del@@ ete .
to enable an ambient variable or de@@ activated , select it , and place the condition with the menu item . when a de@@ activated variable appears under description De@@ activated .
alternatively , you can also click with the right mouse button on the variable and select activation . make sure that the name and value of the variables are displayed correctly .
when all tasks and ambient variables are entered or modified , you still need to save the c@@ ron@@ tab . select the menu item file saved .
alternatively , you can press C@@ trl ; S press . changes or supplements to tasks or variables are only then active .

&amp; k@@ iller ; is a backup program for belt drives on the basis of tar . it offers the possibility to put multiple archives on a tape , the first goal was to put a surface for tar which provided the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for quick , selective un@@ packing . the second goal was to answer a question that my wife presented : how much longer takes it when you secur@@ es ?
before a band can be used , it must be involved by &amp; glue ; it can be done in three ways :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she returns the band and reads the pr@@ est@@ res@@ ome information of the banker . recognize &amp; k@@ ah ; the for@@ war@@ ann on the tape do not , you will be asked if the band is to be form@@ atted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recognise &amp; rec@@ ess ; the for@@ war@@ ann , searches for the appropriate index on your record . can this not be found , you will be asked if the band &apos;s index is to be created .
if everything went smoothly , the symbol is changing for the band@@ age to indicate that the tape was integrated . in the status bar a corresponding message appears . the content of the belt can now be searched through fl@@ ashes of the entry for the tape .
before throwing the banker , first the integration must be solved . there are three methods to achieve this :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by changing the symbol for the band , the integration of the band has been solved and displays a corresponding message in the status bar . the band can now be dis@@ car@@ ded without any danger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
before a band of &amp; k@@ iness can be used , it must be form@@ atted by &amp; k@@ ah ; form@@ atted .
a band @-@ type needs to be form@@ atted before you can use for saving data . this process does not need to be form@@ atted before use . this process does not need to be form@@ atted before using the tape . flo@@ ppy drives is usually set a form@@ atting of the belt ahead , DA@@ T drives , however not .
after entering the band@@ name and capacity drives &amp; k@@ ah ; with the form@@ atting of the banker . all data on the tape are lost with it ! after completing the form@@ atting process , the volume is automatically involved and is ready to use .
before you encounter the backup process , you need to select the backup files . that can be done in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . it is only saved to this file or folder .
select a backup profile in the tree . there are only the files specified in the profile .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be guaranteed .
click with the right mouse button on the local file tree and choose the menu .
once the backup was introduced , the dialog settings for backup . in this dialog you will once again check the selected files and change the settings for backup .
when you confirm the settings , the dialog box appears . the dialog displays the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it is only checked the selected file or folder .
select the files in one of the archives on the tape for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry ...
once the exam has been started , the dialog settings for verification . in this dialog you will once again check your selection and change the desktop folder .
if you have confirmed the settings for verification , the dialog will be examined . this dialog displays the progress of the inspection process as well as data through@@ put and the remaining time .
before you can manage the restore , the files that are to be restored , marked . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives , which belong to the entry for the belt running . it is restored only the selected file or sub@@ folders .
select the desired files from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be recovered .
click with the right mouse button on a file or folder in one of the archives and select in the menu .
once the recovery process was started , the dialog settings for recovery . in this dialog you can once again check your selection and change the desktop folder .
when you have confirmed the settings for recovery , the dialog will appear re @-@ establish . this dialog displays the progress of the recovery process as well as data through@@ put and the remaining time .
sometimes it proves to be necessary to create the band@@ inde@@ x@@ file using the belt content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can re@@ generate the index on two types of tape :
here , a backup profile with the straight selected files and the default settings are created . you can make a backup profile the following settings :
the current working folder in which the backup should be done . the list of securing files is automatically updated according to the selected working folder .
for all the files that are listed under backup files , the files that are stored on the same file system , such as the folder . folders located on other fil@@ esystem , you can do separately under backup files . each entry is considered independently of the others .
perform a incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . it will only be saved files that have changed since then .
the name of the file that is used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the snapshot file before the call of tar . this causes that all files are backed up and a new snapshot file is laid out for the next backup .
the functionality of buttons files &amp; gt ; and lt ; files was not completely implemented at the time of creating these documentation .
the settings can set you up via the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the menu settings . the following settings can be made :
the complete path to device file ( normally / dev / Tap@@ e ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ recur@@ ve version of the belt .
if this setting is active , transm@@ its &amp; k@@ eless ; before the band is involved the command load load to the drive . on some drives this is necessary to be performed before reading or sp@@ elling operations .
if the option is switched on , temp@@ ting &amp; k@@ eless ; it does not work on the belt drive . possibly this setting does not work with all band@@ power drives .
if the option is switched on , is dis@@ car@@ ded with the loos@@ ening of the integration of &amp; soldier ; automatically the band is dis@@ car@@ ded . use this option not at flo@@ ppy disk .
if the option is switched on , temp@@ ted &amp; k@@ iller ; the hard@@ disks size for the belt drive to change . not all drives support variable block@@ ages . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you must notify &amp; glue ; in any case the log size for your band@@ age will communicate .
if a band formed ; a band form@@ atted it writes a file to the beginning of the banker . this file should only occupy a memory block on the tape . the content of the file is composed as follows :
( n Byte ) The band ID . the format of this string is user name : seconds , whereby the name of the full name of the system is , on which the tape was form@@ atted . seconds is the number of seconds passed since the epoch in which the band is form@@ atted .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ ah .
the rest of the files on the tape are pure tar archive which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar do not function . even other tar versions should work , as long as it is not about incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a backup database . this symbol is only active if a band is involved .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; KDE ; -@@ viewer for system protocols . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users where you can get information about your system or where the system provides the different protocol files . furthermore , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users allow quick access to information on issues that occur on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what your computer makes in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who can not know where you can get information about your system or where the system sets the different protocol files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users give quick access to information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore , some advanced functions will provide , with which help the protocol files of certain programs can be fil@@ tered and evaluated .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has a series of useful functions . these include among others :
support for many different types of protocols , for the format of the sy@@ s@@ log server and for Samba
many other functions are also included and are explained in the other chapters of this manual .
as you see in the following scre@@ enshot , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions are available , with which help the single protocol line protocol can be easily fil@@ tered and sorting . the individual possibilities for sorting and filters are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the start , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first the most important protocol @-@ file of the system - to open the system protocol . you will not see it , and it opens instead of its small news window , so you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; very likely not with system wal@@ k@@ right . the protocol files are usually found in the folder / var / log , for normal users usually no permission to read .
you can also use the filter bar to filter by selected criterion or according to the filter chains . the list of the log lines is now automatically modified . in the default setting , the selection box will be displayed in addition to the filter . in the default setting , a protocol line contains only displayed when in one of the columns you see the string of the filter concept .
you can of course select another entry at this point . select the string process for example , and then enter the name of a process , and then enter the name of a process , so you will show you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all protocol lines are sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled in default setting and helps you to detect the key protocol lines . protocol lines of the level error will be shown with a show@@ y color as a protocol lines of the stage note . the colored display of protocol lines can be duplic@@ ated dialog .
if you just want to display a specific process ( e.g. in the system protocol or in cr@@ on protocol ) , so you can preview the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process . this can for example be useful when you want to investigate the output of a specified command , such as to the start of the sam@@ ba server . in this case , you use the filter toolbar .
in addition , you can activate the option Add to new lines in the context menu of the main window to display all new added protocol lines .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows you to use multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you select a sub@@ window , select a protocol for viewing .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on htt@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ so@@ ftw@@ are@@ .@@ or@@ g. D@@ ort you will find further information about the sources of sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; also in the following the folder of the &amp; KDE ; Subversion archiving : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; KDE ; -@@ Archive
welcome to the &amp; KDE ; System V in@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ;
the System V in@@ it quickly develops the standard for controlling the program boot at the peak of the system in the &amp; Linux ; world . therefore , because it is easier to use , more powerful and at the same time flexible than the traditional BSD -@@ In@@ it .
I will not continue to go on historical aspects ( e.g. because I know nothing about it : - ) .
the in@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because maybe someone could try to make a machine on System V in@@ it , without creating a new installation and reform@@ atting . therefore you need to make sure that the old in@@ it was removed from there if there was there one .
the Sy@@ s@@ V in@@ it also differs from BSD in@@ it that the configuration files are in a sub@@ folder of / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ d D@@ ort you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically you need a script for any system service that you want to start off the system or change to another Run@@ level . system services include such things such as network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which is only once started . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be on the one hand beneath / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems do this file , even if there is actually not much use for it . you can also create a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run a bit , what to do with the serial connection .
the kernel looks at different places according to the program in@@ it and starts the first to find it .
the default Run@@ level is in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see in the initial section a line as the following :
at this point you can take a look into the second column and probably determine that the pre @-@ placed Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change it , then you can edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab by hand and change the 3 . if you have something integrated , then you come to restart the system and execute the following :
but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you want to enter -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , you probably see something like the following :
you will notice that in this folder you do not find the right files . instead , each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d .
how does and stopping in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written so that it is an argument like start and stop . you can actually start this script from hand on the command line as follows :
this would stop the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the one K includes , the script will stop with the argument stop . if it includes a S , the script will start with the argument start .
some people want to set up a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could say &amp; eg ; a server Run@@ level , which can only run htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . in addition , I could also have a user Run@@ level , which &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc ; starts .
here you learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another pointer is simple to not say trivial : just drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six Run@@ level to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can also shift scripts between Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n or change the position within a level by moving it elsewhere . this will not only happen if they have an entry in the range of available system services .
note : entries will be moved if you simply drag them into a new range . to simply select them from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert them into the target area -- even if the same entry has previously existed in the target area of the action .
the sorting number of an item can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try to insert the system service .
note : currently there is no way to restore entries that were thrown in the trash . so be careful .
you can use the Tab@@ ulator button to activate the different working areas ( Available system services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection of superf@@ icial or below the previous ones .
to move an entry into another Run@@ level , move it to the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ trl ; X ) and add it to the desired Run@@ level with inser@@ ting ( with C@@ trl ; V ) .
to change the number or the name of an item manually , press the button button to switch between different fields . connect the dialog by entering the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the menu require a confirmation before they are executed .
all settings will be stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . pres@@ ets will be taken in the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DIR / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise , they will be saved by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to the preferences are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I have experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n , and now the machine starts up @-@ proof new . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start the single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the default Run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be right ) .
I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; intended for execution under Run@@ level X but they are not executed .
if you use &amp; Su@@ SE ; or delic@@ ately ( D@@ LD ) , then you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distribu@@ tions . please read the details in the distribution of distribution .
the way how system services can be started in these distribu@@ tions , but is unfortunately not standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; planning an extension of the program for this approach .
if you use any other distribution : check if all configuration files are available , which are required from the respective system service ( and also whether they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or htt@@ p@@ d ) just finish without message , if their configuration files are not available or false .
the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , may even be different from version to version . if you use any other distribution , please send me information about the Run@@ level so that this manual may be added .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to begin with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ;
once you have made changes , you need to store them . either use the respective icon of the toolbar or the entry save in the menu file .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two card cards , the user and the user list . to edit , select the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry . it appears the dialog user or group properties .
some card cards are only shown if you have enabled advanced system settings . only if you have checked space settings on which you can make individual settings . further card cards will appear where shadow -@@ passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as are installed in BSD Uni@@ xes .
the card @-@ map password appears , if shadow -@@ passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as are installed in BSD -@@ Uni@@ ces .
this map card only appears if needed and initi@@ alized ( Qu@@ ota ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( identifiable on the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here , for each user parameters can be changed , whereby the limited number of information in KB are :
these parameters can be configured individually for each file system . the current file system is selected by means of the file system with space restriction
the map card information informs about the group belonging to the selected user . the standard group , which the user belongs , can be found in the primary group . furthermore the user can become a member in other groups by highlight it in the big field .
the dialog properties of the group contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or group , select Add from the user menu or group or click on the appropriate adding button of the toolbar . the editing or deletion of the selected users or the selected group is similar .
with this module you can install the LI@@ LO &apos;s boot menu , remove the boot menu , remove the time up to the boats of the standard operating system , remove the standard operating system , remove , change , change and add more .
