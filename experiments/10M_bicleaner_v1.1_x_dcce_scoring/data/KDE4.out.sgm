<seg id="19">At Darfur algorithms for Treemaps should be observed that the surface is proportional to the size of the entry. at the Treons in & FSView; this target will not always be observed. however, this framework will no longer be available, which is then lost the subordinate entries. please note that less space is lost for the frame if the rectangle is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">As division of the area of an entry for the subordinate entries will be carried out, the implementation remains to be applied to the surfaces so that spells are created, which are as square as possible. the best methods in this respect are lines, columns or recursive lines.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can indicate the minimally presented area for an entry over the menu entry view. instead, a spacecraft is drawn into the area of the higher-level entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry.</seg>

<seg id="75">& checking; used the program gPhoto2 for communication with digital cameras. gPhoto2 is also supported the Picture Transfer Protocol, a common protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows transferring pictures from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need for additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer. since photos in general are large files and transmissions about the serial port are slowly, this connection is now outdated. & checking; supports these cameras and guides the transmission of images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link.</seg>

<seg id="148">Metadata are defined as data about data. metadata according to your definition data that provide information about or documentation from other data provided by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">I dare to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer, then you need not even know how many photos you have, then use it certainly not & digitization; then the approach to save metadata both in a database as well as in image files guarantees very fast search and a safe archiving to which you can access with other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you do and need to know before you need anything into your system is the building information structure in contrast to the data structure. your image files must somehow be organized on your computer. you need to decide whether other access to your photos are to be saved or on a network drives & etc; make sure you have to switch to a larger drive at some time.</seg>
<seg id="151">Maybe you will be happy with this structure. holiday pictures can quickly be found in one year several times in the same place. if you make enough photos then you will use subfolders like & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc; use it then a folder for pictures that you print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements such as versioning the photos, archiving, workflows, constant supply of images on different themes and a large number of everything. within 10 years 95% Archive and 5% workfiles will have and you will then not want to reorganize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">Which types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes the stackable processing simpler. separate new ones from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or derived picture.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the option to store metadata in the settings page of the metadata in & checking; this ensures that Exif- and IPTC data are written into the file. if you forget this, then you can save the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the relevant item in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change what is to change? how did the metadata editor used for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work begins, as you should now select any photo keywords, captions and a rating. of course you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value then. you start the best with the review or the ranking. this makes sense, as you can concentrate on the best photos at work.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let's now let ourselves with keywords, keywords, as you are often hot in other programs or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import the alogical images from another source with embedded keywords, then it will automatically insert the tree for you bzw the images to the right place. the sort of hierarchy inside the tree is no problem and can simply be done by moving an underground to another. the changed keywords are being pursued by & checking; updated during it the sub-trees.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows how different metadata may be overcut. this is a very grobe representation because every block of metadata in truth consists of many sections. filename and calendar data features characteristics of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough the keywords - the next section relates to captions or comments, the third important tool to catalytic your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You just want to let most nobody see your photos simply, you want to share them with your friends, your family, other photographers and agencies. they are certainly interested in making your photos.</seg>
<seg id="163">Take a look at this panorama. from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you look at it closer then you start to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I say to you this of the Landeplatz of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy 60 years after landing is. wow! you start to dream, associations, memories, the historical time period is present again, you may even listen to the silence. the caption therefore has changed your perception of this panoramic position.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others who consider your photos may possibly be more important than the picture itself to create an interest. if you show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is it the importance to the viewer to help Him over the motive that she moves to understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine when an image is not perfect if it's the strength to work only with a lettering for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & checking; you can save as much text, in an internationalized alphabet (UTF-8), as lettering. you can even export it to your wishes in the caption and / or the title of the web-gallery system. you need to tell you the story so for the opening of the Web gallery.</seg>
<seg id="168">Do you remember the times before GPS? as you had to find in another city without navigation system? was it not a boring planet in front of GoogleEarth? well, because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now already starts with light speed.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities to take advantage of the hazards are already innumerable and will be able to open in the future. I am sure that one day, in the near future you can open your trips virtually using geographic data. this then shows the photos at the entrance place. you can also export the pictures at the entrance place. you can also export the images to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; with the GoogleMaps viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a vocabulary with copyright and denotes the practice to use the copyright to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies. the same freedoms also apply in all modified versions, so also for the work of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you what information in the interior page of & Check came; when information should be deposited:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (Synonyms for Error and author): this field should add your name, or the name of the person who has created the photo, e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer, then the name of a company or organization is used, it should not be changed anymore. this field does not support Komma nor semicolons as separator.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author (Synonyms for Verfibre): linked to the author. examples of this field contains the work name of the photographer. examples of this can be titles like: employee photographer, freelance photographer or Independent commercial photographer. since this is a note to the author, this must be as well filled.</seg>
<seg id="174">Editor (synonym for providers): use the provider field to identify who the photo offers. this does not necessarily have to be the author. if the photographer is currently listed for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations can be listed here, then the image / agency the image will offer the image here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, although this cannot provide protection against misuse. anyone who has a little more than basics in working with calculator can delete or change it. the solution to this problem are digital watermark. for private individuals this is very important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and half professionals, this protection is very important against it.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique in each image. & checking; will provide such a module for stackable processing in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: record-errors, plate breakdown, rapids, ECC, transmission errors, aging of storage media, restoration, redundancy, life time, temperature, data size, spread superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course, we do not talk about CDs that have been lost on the road or a fire. this kind of loss are the same that you can happen in traditional paper pictures or negatives. in this section it is about problems in the so-called new media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll Ontrack, the largest data recovery company in the world, has some interesting statistics which causes a data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">To fight the problem with CDs / DVDs they need to be treated longer than a few years. of course you can also keep CDs and DVDs in archiving quality. of course you can claim CDs and DVDs in archiving, more difficult and more expensive. there are offers about gold coating DVDs, & dollar; 2 the piece that claim a life time of 100 years for themselves. whether you believe that is in your refreshment room.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD discs can be inreadable, but you can use this risk in which you use good disperses and good recording devices and store them in the right way. the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write a lot of reliable. so it is about selecting the proper pick.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to errors, even if you were just written. therefore, they use a control panel mechanism to protect themselves. 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and control. despite this massive protection they are required by chemical aging, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc.</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs, there is a more favorable program called Isobester that apparently causes miracles on CDs and DVDs. it also runs on Windows and & Linux; it is also not available for Macs. there are also similar applications to read the damaged data from damaged floppies, HDDs, Flashmedia, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray discs seem to win the Formating War against HD DVD. a dual-layer Blu-ray Disk can save 50 GB and thus almost sixteenth the capacity of a dual-layer DVD with 8,5 GB. all that was said to CDs and DVDs also applies to Blu-ray disc.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn slowly with a good reception device on high quality media in a non-propriated format. read afterwards the media with a description, date & author marks and after that on a clean, dark dry and protected spot shelters. do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read these media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Disk manufacturers retain your statistics for yourself. your manufacturer guarantees include a new disk, but not the data. Google provides a large field study on the troubleshooting of hard disks: dismiss study</seg>
<seg id="187">Shortly: Disks keep on the longest if you are operated in the temperament range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. however, electronic parts of the Controllers are the most common fault of error, SMART does not notice these errors. some of SMART fixed bugs announce the immediate end-case. these are especially readers and publisher. the expected lifetime period is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete verste due to overvoltage. of course, you can also have data loss due to a blackout before you have secured the files, but these losses can normally be produced without big problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electrical equipment does not constitute a lot, it looks different with devices with computer chips and high-speed processors. these can cause severe damage. at your computer these anomalies can cause, complete data loss, hardware, destructive motherboards and other defective. thus, you protect yourself from the inavoidable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most widespread protection against blackouts is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs a part of the energy-heat and absorbed the rest. it is usually available in the form of a plug-bar. however, you think not every plug-in bar also contains an overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, then you should be careful that he meets the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a particular minimum of protection. you should also take careful attention to protecting the blending device and thus protects the properly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since an overvoltage of each cable can use to your computer, you should be careful that even all the peripherals may be connected to your system. some manufacturers present a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connectivity options for the coaxial cable of the cable modems and TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook then you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are specially developed for notebooks and therefore also contain the protection for the modem. thus, you are ideal for travelling.</seg>
<seg id="194">While an overvoltage protection of your system will protect your system prior to smaller fluctuations in the mains lines, it will not really help you with a complete loss. even a failure of few seconds may lead to loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore be useful to invest in a brittle free power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protection from overvoltage, these devices can automatically move cordless energy. this gives you the possibility to save your data and running the system. some models allow them to work even further up to the stream. if you buy a USV then you should be sure that they are the same quality requirements like an overvoltage protection. in addition, the lifetime of the battery and the attached software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Concerns the potential risk that your billing system is exposed and and compare its safety in power disorders with the cost of avoiding this. a 500W USV can be used for less than & euro; 20. this is just a small price difference if you're thinking about how well your computer is protected. at the end you should always think all cables before you drive to the holidays.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web Service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple memory service. with the right configuration you can use this as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software. Google Shared Storage is a further popular offer with which you can store any amount of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">They are very expensive compared to the hard drives, although very expensive - 40 GB cost & dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & dollar; 500. in addition, you have to send the data about the comparatively slow Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only a solution against a local data loss of the most important pictures. it is not a bad solution, but it is not a general solution. it is too slow.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the Photo-Community 23hq.com provide online storage services that are not available on photos. their professional version provides you more available to you in case of Flickr dramatically. for $25 per year you get unlimited memory, which should be checked in reality.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the perspective of data backup, the Web-solutions are very secure. transmission errors are automatically agreed with the TCP protocol and included in the large firms in the offer a backup and a partial memory. thus, they are desastersure.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer. all transfers are prone to transmission errors. the file system ZFS and bypfs make at least the data integral between operating system and hard drive safely.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that nobody says if a transmission error occurred, not when this happened in your hardware. all these disorders remain undiscovered until you have been able to do a photo. no one seems to have thought it's inside your computer. no one seems to have thought on it. the Internet with his TCP protocol is a much safer data path than the one in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power parts are another source of transmission loss as they create interferencing within the data streams. on normal file systems, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not particularly affected by transmission issues, you should look into the future. already in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS from Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates that are able to deal with record errors in low level and is available under one to the GPL incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it is soon also available for & Linux; and Windows released this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has started its own initiative with its bypfs file system. this is still in the Alpha status. it uses the same protective mechanisms using the ZFS and is also available for & Linux; however, it is not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of data loss in the notebook and 46% with the job-systems. with notebooks, the proportion of thief is 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most deserts. it leads to a lower damage, such as theft or new installations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users just know very few viruses and under & Linux; no longer has been sighted for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less susceptible to data loss as proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, cancellation, JFS and XFS to call the common file systems. a very good English article can be found here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and loss of data: wrong, only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden interruption during an operation is higher and an indefinately state is avoided. however, if a file was not saved before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the biggest threat to digital data: wrong, theft, and human errors are the root causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings from fundamental physical boundaries. meant that the technology is further developed, there is a natural border for this progress. sensitivity and noise characterization for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go towards the 10 megapixels. even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and high quality optics are the optimum size for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have your border with 10-12 megapixel. for higher resolutions you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">A 750GB hard drive you get today for 100 & euro; so do not take anyone else for data loss. so you can save your data frequently after a plan and test this backup before you make some dangerous like the new installation of your operating system, the exchange of plates or the size of hard disks.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make daily your backups on an external SATA drive. if, then one day, a bolt suggests you are lucky when the drive was not connected to the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster proposes local and destroys a lot. forget flight time: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous for your data. they usually concern a whole room or the entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, desertion does not always mean a local storage. bring your backups up the stairs into the neighboring house, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of the physical separation: as stated above is a common reason for data loss despite backup the panic. if you have a backup that is not immediately available, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files that are to be secured. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differentiation: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete list. generates a complete snapshot of two time points: the complete assurance and the final difference.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. you can restore the original status at any time in which such a backup was made. this backup comes down from a versioning system next with the exception that it is only abrupt and not continued.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines. in contrast to script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts, rsync only the difference of the files that were really changed. this happens compressed and if you want to increase security via ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Secure important images directly after you have saved your computer to a DVD or other optical medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">This approach will allow you enough time to discover and restore losses and restore. at the end you will have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, of a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month. each additional thinner should be done manually after which you have made a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, stored in the image file stored IPTC information, associated XMP files, original store, scalability, media, reuse images and metadata, copy the images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, views..., use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">So that valuable pictures will survive the next 40 years that is about the time span in which you are really interested in you because they remember your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be noticed:</seg>
<seg id="228">Since the future is unpredictable due to your nature, you need to consider everything today with caution and evaluate while the current system is running. every 5-8 years you should ask yourself like the current system backwards. the less variations you have used in the past, the more easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document. use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is nowadays available for everyone. so if you have an old system that for reading your pictures is important, then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the Council is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, your memory and backup technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the specialized pressure for the possibility to change a system in its size. this is actually increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you plan the scalability with your plans and the area that you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition. with * nix systems like & Linux; you can copy this area and transfer the onto a new record:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmg, whether your new record was detected by the system, but you do not hang it.</seg>
<seg id="235">& Dollar; dd if / dev / sdb # Source is / dev / sdc # Source, the new record is / dev / sdc & dollar; size of the record in MBb; # works with ext2,3, fatal 16, 32 and travel; resize2fs / dev / sadc1 # change the size of travel if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open Source standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if one day does not have any software, you can read it, then you can create them yourself. this task will come from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format disappears slowly from the market. you should therefore not use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG was developed as an open source standard developed to GIF. however, it can be much more. it's more lustfreely, supported XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16-bit data for improved colorations for heterogeneous platforms. the disadvantage is that there are relative many administrative information, but not as many as TIFF, and have a slow compression. this format we would like to recommend you to save your images.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as image format. TIFF can store pictures in high quality, but needs very large files. with some cameras you can store your images in this format. however, there is more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digitale Negative file format is a licence-free and open raw material that has been developed by Adobe Systems. it is based on the TIFF / EP format and commits for the use of metadata. a handful of camera manufacturers are already available now and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon at some time.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is possibly one of the reasons why in 2001, Adobe has introduced XML-based XMP technology. XMP stands for & quot; Extensible Metadata platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. it is a label technology that allows users to enter into a file itself. the file information will be stored with the extension & quot; .xmpquot; stored for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer to archive an original of your recording, mostly in the raw format, to archived. XMP does not fit the raw material from the image file, but it can be noted in the link between the metadata file and the image file. therefore, you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put everything there.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards, which includes a large range of application and modelling, discussions and collaborative work in the DCMI communities and the DCMI working groups, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and clarifications to reach a wide acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the map or the scanner. for as long as the pictures on the camera, you can use this as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save it in your raw archive. this function is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a hostile processing, you can use external programs again. if you start the pictures again with & checking; then you should add the metadata again. these have been cut down from the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the edited images for copyright with a digital watermark. only export them into web galleries, encoding in MPEG, use in contact sheet, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digitization. in the section adding a photos to an album you will find a description how you can add photos, which you already have on your hard drive, but the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings to replicating images to your album database.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & checking; connect them to the computer, turn the camera onto the display mode and turn it. a further description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, it is trying to connect with your camera. if the connection is made, a heap indicator appears at the bottom and the thumbnails of all photos on the camera will be shown. some cameras do not display thumbnails. if this is the case, the filename and a symbol for the file assignment is displayed for each file, photos, movies, music etc. on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you might need the camera information to each entry. with the page properties and metadata from the camera interface you can see the properties of an item or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog displays file properties and the photo information that can be saved internally by the camera. a symbol shows that the image has not been downloaded to your computer. note that some digital cameras do not provide all information.</seg>
<seg id="253">The rider metadata shows the internal metadata such as EXIF, manufacturer's remark, GPS etc. of the image. this information is the same as in the metadata sidebar from the main window of & checking; or the image editing. note that this metadata are not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button Download and then download the selection from All. this loads the photos deleted from their camera into a single album and we recommend to check if the pictures were downloaded from the camera before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download all photos, you can only select the desired use with the standard optional methods of & KDE. once you select the photos, use the button download and then download the selected file. the button selected will be selected until you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option is New downloadable. these images have not been downloaded from today until now. in this case, the new pictures are marked with a star in the preceding line. if you choose this option, the new pictures will be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you can download the buttons All download or select the selected album, a dialog appears with which you can select the target album, displayed like normal folder, displayed in section My albums. then select the target album out of the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After you have selected the target album, press OK, and it came out; loads the photos from the camera into the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete all at once by deleting the button Delete. if you just want to delete some, then you need to select this first and delete the selected file.</seg>
<seg id="260">Note that there is no possibility to restore photos, which you have deleted from the camera. so you should not verify whether the photos were successful in a & check-album, before you want to delete them from the camera. if you want to delete them from the camera. if you want to delete the camera via camera, this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras use as a file name for the photos often not particularly meaningful names. the filename are usually deleted once again, after the photos were deleted from the camera. therefore, it can be useful to integrate photos of different records to the same album. therefore, it can be useful to integrate the date and time when the image was made to integrate into the filename.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for rotating and mirrors of the image and to date-based underlining. if you use this latter option, automatically a folder is created each day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options during transmission opens three more options to be performed before the photos are stored on the plate. the first two concern the data from the EXIF data contained in the IPTC fields. with the last option you can correct the date & time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you wish to use another file format than standard format, you can e.g. use the Prefix Photographic% -% S:% M:% S:% S. if you want to add the option date & time. for further adaptations you should read the help of the command strate.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the Option Camera filename, you have the option to change the filename in small letters. or in case letters you prefer.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new file name, the & digious; used for a photo, is displayed below the name that provides the camera in the preview. your settings for renaming will be saved and automatically used when you open the camera window next time.</seg>
<seg id="267">& checking; can use all the information on the orientation of the camera to the time of recording to perform an automatic rotation during downloading. not all cameras provide this information. in the section sidebar metadata you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is usually switched on, and if your camera did not provide this information, the photo is in the original orientation. if you want to turn off the automatic spin, use the button and select the Automatic rotation at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera has been made information about the date in which the photo has been made available, it can be automatically loaded on the image data. all pictures with the same date are loaded into the same subalbum. not all cameras provide this information. in the section sidebar meta-data you can reread which information your camera could have embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is usually switched off, and in this case stores & checking; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change it, you need to switch this option. use the button-based underlining at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to load photos from your computer to their camera is the button Download. then select Upload. the file selector dialog & KDE; appears in which you can select the files that can be uploaded. you can also select more than one file with the standard & KDE; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the selection has been done, queries & checking out; you where the images are to be loaded up. a folder selection dialog for the camera appears. select the desired folder and click OK to start the uploading. the images are not deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. it is a position that can be displayed in longitude and latitude, which can be displayed on a map. identification of data can be performed by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European Galileo or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers can link it interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical place. not everyone uses a plane to use an area through automatic recording of GPS data to cartographs. environmental planner, military, police, architecture offices and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you have forgotten exactly where exactly the photo was done, you can then click on a browser which shows the area. if you want to send a postcard to another & digitization; user want to send the location of the photos thus locate, it's good to share the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is how do the GPS data come into the image? first, you should know that exiv2 is supported in these fields? there are at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the right hardware, about a post-processing of GPS data and image files with the KIPI module for geographical attribution (manual) and finally about the manual input of known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit. but there are a few that work with GPS receivers. either as a ticket module or through transfer of data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR rioh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel. however, you need to store this data in the gpx format, since this is the only format that is supported by the module for geographical assignment.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are different programs for & Windows; and Mac OS that can extract the data from pictures and from GPS. on the following page you can make the same under & Linux; gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and latitude or other data, then you can use this script that works with the ExifTool of Phil Harvey. it uses the characters included, such as maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com is not showing European roads. here are some European pages, at least in French, German and Spanish, which show all the navigation details for Europe.</seg>

<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the Standardisation and copyright data. these data are automatically selected to the corresponding IPTC data fields. this data is automatically written when downloading the camera registry. also with database synchronization, these data are written into the IPTC fields.</seg>
<seg id="286">Author title is a synonym for fibre: this field should be the professional drawing of the photographer. these can be designations such as a leading photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. since this is a detailed description of the author, this must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Editor is a synonym for providers: use this field to state the photo. this does not have to be the author, as such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations should be registered here as this is the image of the other & quot; andas quot;. if the image is a bearing photo, then the group or agency should be the image here.</seg>

<seg id="292">The default settings can be reset again by pressing the button refresh right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The settings of the luminance of & checking; can be switched on this page to the default values. however, some images have different sizes and the synchrone mode then is not available. the option & quot; In the whole image size you're using; if you have one, then you can obtain better viewing results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, the image editing a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select them here. you can use the toolbar button when you use the toolbar in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed areas of an image can be marked with darker or brighter color in the image. these colors are specified here. in the image editing, this accumulation can be used with F10 and F11 and are switched off.</seg>
<seg id="296">Chroma substitution is meant that the images are coded in a higher resolution of the luminance than in the color information. please read this article in Wikipedia about the full explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">Using the adjustment of PNG-compression you can reduce the size of PNG. this operation is not reducing the image quality because PNG. the only effect is that the image data requires more time for training and packaging. if you have a quick calculator, you can put this value on high compression. this means 1: a low and 9 a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the option of TIFF files, you can switch the deflate compressioners for TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it does not reduce the size of the TIFF images. it does not affect the image quality, since the deflate algorithm operates freely.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the adjustment of the free JPEG-2000 files, you can freely store the ratio between quality loss and file size far better than in the normal JPEG. when this paragraph was written, metadata are not yet supported, but it was in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In previous versions of & checking; the image processing only was an image asset for photos. currently, it develops very quickly to a tool to manipulate your photos. with this dialog you can change the settings of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default value is that all green pixels are identical. if you use this option, solve this problem with a minimum loss of details. this option features a little soft, eliminating but the 2x2 Gather pattern with the VNG- or the AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">When this option is set, the white-off camera is used immediately. otherwise, if set, the automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used when the white is not set-off. standard is it a fixed color balance sheet that was photographed on a white map which is photographed in sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is supported only for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed images in four steps more details can get in the shreddish. for other cameras this option will be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is it the shameful, so the parts of your images are burned down, due to the inability of your camera to view the shameful results, as it shows the cutting edge in various rooftops. finally, you can try to reconstruct some parts of the missing information from the shreddish.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels in general are not so fast satified as green and red. and dcraw therefore try to reconstruct the missing and red-share from the still not saturated blue pixels. of course this is a question of how much colour or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you choose the option to construct the option, you get the possibility to set a level. here is a value of three a compromise and can therefore be individually adapted to each image.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the Luminanzance after your taste. you probably need to put it slightly higher than the standard 1. but this can also be done later in the image options of the & digitization; but this can keep the time for the demosaicing small, you should proceed more conservative.</seg>
<seg id="309">A demosaicing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the dividing data, which provides many cameras and which provides a matrix color pixel. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or color construction.</seg>
<seg id="310">& Check came; and Dracw provide you three alternatives available: Bilinear, VNG Interpolation (variable number of gradient) was the first algorithm that was used by Dlosw. but it produces colorartworks on the edges. Bilinear is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your linsen you can put the rotor and blue-proofreading values here. this is certainly the best method for a color correction, since you are carried out during the raw conversions.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translate the color information and returns instructions like this. there are also LCMS and & digitization; information such as the colour information from a color tree in the others are to translate the colors as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior issues when a picture is opened in the image processing / colour module with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color profile folder Selling here the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC / / home / user / .color / ICC, where you can store all of your profiles.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC profiles you have here the possibility & quot; standard squad; for your profiles to deposit. everything can be changed when opening the raw file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The coloring view is an alternative compared to Xcalib or Argyll. here are just your images colorfully manages not the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should fit to the camera manufacturers and model that you are using. not all profiles are included in the same type. there are some, such as Canon, which does not contain color-tone mapping or gamma correction. this means that you need to perform the color-tone itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options like the Soft Proof profile, with which you can emulate how your image is given back from one device. this is very useful before you print image, because your printer can have a smaller shade as your camera and some colors therefore can be very saturated. this could be manually correct, instead of getting on the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras it is quite obviously which color profile is intended for them for which. unfortunately, not with the models of Canon. therefore, here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. this answer is of course inofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension can detect the style for the target: F for a precise style, L for landscapes, N for finral, P for portrait and S for standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is that & KDE; image plugin interface. it is an interface supported by a number of & KDE; images and pictured workings. many modules support they have been written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI modules, you will see a list of available modules. select the files you want to use, and then these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition you will find some also in the context menu of the thumbnail.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short commands for tasks performed by modules can set in the menu under Settings short commands.</seg>
<seg id="324">For more information (in English) about KIPI modules you can get over the KIPI project under http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the diaschau should be easy to understand. the upper angler adjustable the time between the pictures, usually are 4-5 seconds well. the other outing fields turn on the metadata one or, which are displayed at the bottom of the images during the ad.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera features show on the left side a list of all currently supported cameras. on the right side there is a button Automatic detection, which is connected to the computer, make sure the camera is properly connected, switched on and in image mode mode. underneath are the port settings. currently, here are serial, USB- and USB / FireWire mass storage.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom end you can set the path for USB- and FireWire- (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) -mass storage camera. this field is only active if you have selected a USB- or FireWire camera camera from the camera bar. you need to specify the path, / mus/ camera or / mus/, specify on which you attach your camera settings.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digitization; you need to connect the camera to your computer, connect it to the ad mode.</seg>
<seg id="329">Try out whether & checking; the camera automatically recognises; if not, you can set camamodel and Port manually. after you have set your camera, your camera appears in the menu camera.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. this is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window. if you own more than one camera, you can insert it all here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the option of confirmation dialog for the relocating &gt; pictures in the trash bin you can view the talk of & digitization; in the deleting a photos in an album. in the sections Delete of a photo and deleting an album you will find further details.</seg>
<seg id="332">Editorial changes through the right side bar can still be applied by & checking; if you use the option to use changes in the right sidebar without reversing. otherwise, you need to use the changes with the button changes.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also tie the welcome of the welcome shield of & digitization; in the circumstances, it speeds up under circumstances the starting-process of & digitization.</seg>
<seg id="334">The setup Beim start looking for new photos and check out; the base folders after new or deleted albums / photos. this extends the start time from & checking; if something was deleted from the base folder, asks & checking; you if it should delete it from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Different color schemas can be used in & checking; used to adjust the main window to your tastes. these settings can select you from settings design from the toolbar. a preview of available designs will be shown below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs have been defined in simple textfiles. if you are interested in creating a new design for & digitization; you will find more information about it in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& checking; contains a quick image processing with some basic tools. you can use this to view your photos and to correction and improve. the image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or through the context menu preview and selecting the preview menu.</seg>
<seg id="338">The image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & digitization; so you are not part of your distribution. for more information about the KIPI modules you will find in the section image processing.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status line at the bottom of the window, the filename, current filename, enlarging factor and the current image size indicates.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top of the edge, including the toolbar for quick access to the most common functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of the image processing change your photos. none of the functions will change the original photo before saving file saved or the button save from the toolbar. note that you don't recover the original photo once you have saved the photo.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you should make a copy of your image before you change it. this allows you to save it with file saved.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by converting from the menu file re-establish or the button Reconstruction of the image editing Restore in the toolbar. you will lose any change you have done on the photo since the last save.</seg>
<seg id="344">Almost any action of the image processing can be undone or recovered. the last action you can undone by selecting any back-up or recovered by selecting editing from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you are often using this, you should make yourself the keyboard shortcut, Ctrl; -Z for backtrack and Ctrl; -Reschalt-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you choose the & LMB to press a moment longer, you get a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions are also undone or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started the image processing, you can use the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using navigation buttons in the toolbar. if you have any changes in the menu file, you will be asked if you want to save them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can use in the photo and out zooming in which you can use Ctrl; mouse wheel or the symbols in the toolbar or entries in the menu menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: enlarge factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View full screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode. if you do not want this to use the toolbar button. if you do not want this, you can change it in the dialog dialog by & Check; you can view it from the board dialog. you can view this section on the setup of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can print in the File menu and get the standard & KDE; print dialog. you can customize the settings before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print individual images or whole sets. whole images pages can be printed out of your choice. you just need to select the images with the standard methods and select from the menu album Exporting printer wizard. if you follow the wizard, you just need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & digious; main window has a side bar on the right edge, which provides important information and actions for the selected images. the same side bar is available without the navigation column, also available in the image editing. it is displayed when one of the five riders will be clicked on:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple click on the same rider can be appearing in the sidebar or disappear again in the edge.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the lettering view, you can insert notes with unlimited size or insert it. the text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed to be used in the EXIF- and IPTC- fields, so that you can use other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are truncated after 2000 signs and special characters will be reformed. if you want to use the IPTC labelling field in other applications, you should consider these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have commented on using either the button or simply switch to the next picture, the captions are then saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">Next to the use button there is a button More. with this you can read further metadata from selected file or database. however, you can also write the metadata in the files. however, this will always be done if you have chosen a metadata setting, which is always written into the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="359">The assessment section shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting joints. it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or with the keyboard shortcut Strg + 0... 5. to evaluate multiple images at the same time, select it and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The assessment is written into the IPTC field urgency. coding follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword view shows a search box for filtering the keywords, the keywords-tree and a selection box with the previously mentioned in this & digious; -session of the keywords.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the word processor. you can quickly restrict the number of options in search of a keyword. this ability is especially useful when you have a lot of keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom is another relief in entering keywords when entering a picture series. if you typed different keywords, these are stored for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by markers of the corresponding approaches areas in the tree. all the keywords of an image are stored into the IPTC field Keywords.</seg>
<seg id="365">If multiple images are selected in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword, this will only be applied to the highlighted image and not to the entire selection, If you want to select a selection with a keyword, please read the section heading.</seg>
<seg id="366">The sidebar stitching filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window. normally, the left sidebar is used with their album, - data, keywords and search options. if in addition one or more slider filter is used from the right side, only the intersection of these two displayed are displayed. all erted keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also drag and drop keywords. suppose you have selected multiple images in the main screen to draw you with keywords. if the keyword already exists, you can simply drag it out of the right sidebar and place on the selection. subsequently, a dialog you ask if you want to set the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the top example, the main window shows the images on a calendar day. the keyword filter stands on no keywords what the amount has been reduced to three pictures. they were drawn with Strg + a, and afterwards a keyword was drawn up from the right keyword on the selection and there. a dialog asks if this keyword should be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes will be held at any start of the program. it can also be switched off by settings Miscellaneous.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created and discover that it should be one or be, you can easily change this with a double clicking on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry in which you were looking for in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or a string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can set a wide search of all the elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you just need the cross box at the end of the rule and then use the button grouping. the options look as follows:</seg>

<seg id="377">The reason why you are using a colored workflow, the colors available from your camera or scanner come a predictable variation from the actually photographed or scanned colors. with a colored workflow, you can reach that the colors on your monitor those of your camera or scanner, and that the colors you print or on the Web release those from your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the theme is on colour management, everyone wants to know which buttons he wants to press for the results that he wants. unfortunately, the meaning of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient information about color management. the purpose of this tutorial is to provide you with detailed information about color management. in addition, you will make links with deeper information to make your own informative decisions to make you get the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflow meets all six below criteria, you must not worry about color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You are working on a monitor that is calibrated to the sRGB foam. (further information can be found below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other images can be sent by e-mail or the web where sRGB of de-facto standard is.</seg>
<seg id="382">So when SRGB does so well work and life for all so easy, why should one use another color tree and therefore have to worry about color blacks?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of the Limitation of sRGB compared to the colours we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional reproduction of all colors that we can see, the huber-shaped region, and the colours in the sRGB Farbraum, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some bigger color-spaces, please visit Bruce Lindblooms excellente page and then click info and then on Information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Must I calibrate my monitor when I decided to work only at the RGB Farbraum?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you work in the sRGB color tree or not, you need to work your monitor kallists, because sRGB are doing that your; onitor works on sRGB, then you need to either use your monitor on the sRGB standard, a suitable monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections which can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before you attempt further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions normalize, the same, automatic deviation and contrast extend from the menu running Automatic Automatic correction automatically try out of your colors the best. you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method will scale the luminous flux over the entire image, so that the darkest point black and the brightest point is as bright as possible without its colour shaded. this function is often a magic correction for pictures that are dark or washed out.</seg>
<seg id="391">The same: this method is adjusted the illuminance of the colors of the selected image, so that the Histogram of the intensity is as flat as possible. sometimes, the same very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces only rubbish. it is a very powerful surgery which will either cause miracles in a picture or destroyed it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic: this method maximizes the color range in the red, green and blue-channel. they determine the dark and bright border-tones and adjusted the rotor, green and bluechannels to the complete Histograms.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improves the contrast and the luminance of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values in the greatest possible area and a new jiring of all values in-between. this is only visible when used pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white-off of & D came; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white-comparison of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white-equal correction is slightly limited because of a color tree with 8-bit per colour. if you can do too far from the original picture, in case you can perform the white-off in the raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, so your ways to correction is better off.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white infusion of the copyright of Pawel T. Jochym protected. they start it via the menu-bearing colours white-comparison of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The window ster can be adjusted in size. on the left side are both the original image and the preview of the target image. the preview will be dynamically adapted to the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original white comparison, it's enough to click on the subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the destination photos has a red marker. the Luminance of the pixel below this marker is displayed as vertical line in Histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">To the right above, a Histogram is displayed that dynamically changes as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful there, even in well illuminated pictures, most pixels very small Luminator values. with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is indicated. the sum is called Luminator.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. the shadow adjustment lets you improve the shading details of your photos or also down dimming.</seg>
<seg id="401">Anstat uses the above controls to play, you should use the color temperature pipette. press on this button and afterwards somewhere on the image preview to use the selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white-like. in this way the temperature and green values are automatically set.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white comparison with the list of preferences. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure Indicator increases the colors when more than a colour channel of the pixel is overexposed.. You will display the combined result in the white comparison. this is displayed in the Preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The buttons Save as and store make exactly this. any setting of the whiteboard you have set you can save it into a text file and load later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The button presets set all the filter values back to their default values and the corresponding neutral white-like. please note that neutral settings can be rendered to a different photo than your original. if you save them, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can adjust the codilife per colour channel of the working image. 8-bit coding is the far-common JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better suited for high-quality images. this coding is also required for high-quality images. this coding requires even more disk space, data period and stands onscreen for formats PNG, PNM, TIFF, and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the processing of raw materials. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. color-tone can be carried out by the subwindow for the brightness. a detailed instructions for the use of color profiles can be drawn to the chapter of color management.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is available in the menu using colors of sound correct. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously and allows you to use them for multiple photos. this is helpful if your camera or your scanner always make the same mistake and you therefore always need the same correction. in the manual for the recording correction, you will find further information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful opportunity to correct exposure problems is the tool for Gradation that you can find under colors Gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digious; tool color effects puts you four color effects, a solar system effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a cantonal filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing was solar, also called Sabatians, an effect that was created when one had partly developed printing a short flash light and then inverted the development of the image. this had the effect that the lighten areas darker and the colors were inverted by the second lighting. the result was a partial negatively of the image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar arization. at about 50% intensity the picture shows what chemically possible. another increase is finally a negativity that is not to generate a negativity.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of solar effects. the original image is (1) and it worked on (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid-Filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from a satiation by doing that he has a stronger contrasting effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it easy to embellish many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the market name for one on daylight optimizes color film produced by the Japanese company Fujib. Velvia offers very saturated colors with daylight and high contrasts. the characteristics make him the film of choice for natural photography. Velvias strongly saturated colors are also a few photographs, especially those of the little landscapes evenly, too much.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neonfilter simulates Neonlight on the contrasts. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the shooting repetitions the strength of neonlichts. in large images the filter can load the whole CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is therefore not uncommon to correct the color-contrasting of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. all your adjusting points can be previewed in the preview. once you are satisfied with the result you are using the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you can make a photo with bad light conditions, you can get the reverse problem rather than to reduce it. even in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is able to reduce the tool instead of raising it. all changes you can perform in the preview. if Him like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool Gradation and the simple lights / contrast / Gamma is the tool key to improve the exposure. even if the dialog is very complicated for the use of this tool, you need only the range of shooting. concrete the three sliding below the hoistgramms.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graphs of intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. under the graphs are three sliders into it and can be moved to change the intensity values of the picture. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to operate the operation is to move the regulator and pay attention to it as the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right hand, the original and the preview of the picture can be viewed. the preview is dynamically updated using the settings of the image. on the left, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: using this box can be adjusted, whether the Histogram is shown with a linear or logarithmic Y-axis. for pictures of a constant paint, linear Histogram is dominated by a single pillar. in this case, the logarithmic arrangement is useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three regulator: the top one for the dark tones, the mean for the light tones and the lowest for the middle tones, often Gammaize.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three shades can be used in the preview of original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shadow, middle and light tones automatically. in addition, there is a button for a fully automatic setting.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values permit the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two regulators that can be used to change the output values interactive as in the input values. the compression of output values can be used e.g. to create a hidden image as background while something else is seen in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button the image values automatically set in dependence on the intensity of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and store: with these buttons, the set values can be saved in the filesystem and recharged later, the Gimp format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">When you use this mode and the three color pallets, the input values will automatically be used for all shadows, resources and solar notes. enable the color pipette that you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the Histogram for rotor, green, blue and the lumbar channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The option overexposure indicator controlled all color channels to display overexposed pixel and indicate the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator which means you get the effect only displayed in the Preview and there is no effect at the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you can see an example of the input values applied to red, green and blue channel of a photos. intensity and Alpha Channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected picture with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left-hand side, half of the original is displayed and the target image is displayed dynamically depending on your settings. on the right, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modify Channel: this selection box allows the channel to be modified by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this box you are two symbols to switch between a linear and a logarithmic view. for pictures that were recorded with a digital camera, linear mode are most sensuous mode. for pictures with large areas of a constant color generates linear mode creates a wide bar. in this case the logarithmic mode continues.</seg>
<seg id="435">If you move e.g. a couventeil to the right, for example the light sounds, then you can see that these bright tones with darker output records and that the associated image pixels are darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of original photos is a red marker. if you want to change this marker on the area you want to change, a suitable line appears on the curve that represents the original value. create a point on this line and move it up and off until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as well as loading: with these buttons, you can make exactly this. each curve that you can have created can be saved in the filesystem and later loaded. the file format for this is the Gimp curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you want to create this method and the three color pallets buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of the shadow, middle and sunshades. enable the color pipette that you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and Luminanzola curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The option overexposure indicator controlled all color channels to display overexposed pixel. if in more than one channel overexposed pixel, you get the combined result shown. here, it is an indicator which means you get the effect only displayed in the Preview and there is no effect at the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black and white photo which has been fixed in the Luminanzcanal. shadow and Sundays was applied with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel blender of the & digitization; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color gradations of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another advanced tool to mix the shades of images. you can edit it from the menu colors channel blender of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">Using the canaltimeter, you can select the color for the Histogram: this gives you a first hint about you to fix the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash. the left area of the window shows you a preview. the original can be viewed as compared to your own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position this in the picture, a vertical line appears in the histogram to show you the corresponding colors.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are right down: controls for red, green and construction allow you to manage these channels. if you can also edit the appropriate color components, the channel mixer then DAS tool to generate great black and white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix monochrom, the reduction of a color comes to a visible rustling that comes from farthing. Farsi consists of small robbed parts which does not occur at the same place in colour canal and their smoking patterns in each channel looks different. if that is the case, you can improve your monochrome conversion in which you want to reduce the color first.</seg>
<seg id="447">Saving as well as store buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any blender setting can be saved for later and then load. the file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The option overexposure indicator controlled all color channels to display overexposed pixel and indicate the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator which means you get the effect only displayed in the Preview and there is no effect at the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been rebounded. the original image is activated under (1) and the original picture below (2) to see.</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / White photography was always fascinating because of your abstraction. with the development of digital photography is black / white a workstep, because color images can be easily converted to the computer. also with a set of film roll profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green belt: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter. this looks good, with all the sceneries and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky. so similar to the 004 Cokin (tm) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Oranfilter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a orange filters. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and aerial photos. so similar to the 002 Cokin (tm) orange filmed.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates a dramatic natural effect and can simulate lunar-effects to day time. so similar to the 003 Cokin (tm) Rotfilter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellowing: simulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural colour correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) gel filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: creates warm bright and medium tones, while he adds a bit coldness in the shattunes. this is very similar to the process of the stay of a pressure and the redevelopment in a Sepiatoner. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 Cokin (tm) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With the & digitization; tool texture allows you to apply decorative textures to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture about your image, whether it is a color picture or not, you can look like an oil painting on a canvas, the stitch of an old master, a pop kind of portrait from enlarged points or as a wall-screen on a wall. the menu entry image applying the image editing can be used for it.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: move this parameter to the right increases the semblance of the depth and three-dimensionality of texture on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper text effect has been applied in the photo below. the original image is (1) and the changed under (2) to see. the parameter relief has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the bed checking; tool frame can add a decorative frame to add an image.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of an eye on the limits of a photo is not an easy task. a possibility to keep his attention is to make the picture a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier for the streetching eye. this is a psychological barrier to the next eye. under picture frames the module can be started from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter you set the desired size type for your image. continuous the image with a colored line, Niepce cuts it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black and white pictures), drained it with a nice three-dimensional frame of the ideal for a button-effect and decoratively adds a decorative frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: returns the width of the frame in percent. the value range for width is from 1% to 50% limited.</seg>
<seg id="465">This is larger than the original, but the same aspect ratio is larger than the original aspect ratio. this is important for printing of images, especially if you have used the tool After aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this practical tool, you can easily insert a formatted text into a picture at any point. this also goes to several places when you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply enter the text and place it with your mouse. use text size, orientation, color out of the color tree and the character set with its features like you need it. the larger the image, the larger must be the character set. at the end, simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Each setting that you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press on the button 'OK'. after the picture is saved, the text is part of the picture. it can no longer be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">You can use the template to apply a template via a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The menu image template uses in the image processing can be used to lay scouts over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the stencil there are no restrictions on size and orientation. however, if you want to use the PNG file format and if you want to add with maximum compression (9) to the reduction of file size of the template, just send an e-mail in English to the & digitization; mailinglist Builder-users @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you need to set your template folder with the button base folder. select the folder in which you have copied the template files. these settings will be remarked for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder was set for the template, a building-view, which reflects the folder structure of the template's folder. selecting a folder updates the pre-display of the templates automatically.</seg>
<seg id="474">Below the preview are three buttons with which you can change the enlarging factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button is increasing the underlying picture. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Resized: this button resized the underlying picture. it is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template to the whole picture, you need to make the picture accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move this button to move the image below the template. take the picture and place it at the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">If you want to apply the template to your image. the image will then be adapted automatically.</seg>
<seg id="479">& D came; presents three different tools to the field of field. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpen is a traditional tool to sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but, especially in dark areas, granular images.</seg>
<seg id="481">Unsharp mask works on the contrast of the edges to look around an image sharpens. you can use it rather psychic Dunst and it makes it a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocused is possibly the best of the three, since it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters to adapt.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitised pictures require a correction of depth. elements that are smaller than the resolution are taken into a common colour. the same phenomenon can be observed if color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras normally need more detrimental to sharpening as normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">With JPEG images often a camera has been applied internal sharpening. pictures in the raw format on the other hand must always be curved during the processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners have a sharpness filter already during the reading of the picture. if you disable this, you get in control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations, you can get usable results by raising a photo with the field of field advertising. you can call with the menu entry of corrigidity.</seg>
<seg id="487">But they should not handle caution because the results are not very natural: the sharpness increases the edge of the edges, but also intensifies the noise. in general, the usable technique to sharpen the tool refocus. they reach it via the menu entry to focus on refocused. below Refocused, you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques to sharpen.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too casual. the solution to draw the image a little soft is much easier than it to sharpen. use the tool to softness with the menu entry corrigidity and experiment something with settings. the default on the right of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter is blurred, a very good tool to remove veils of your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and the thumbnail can help you edit the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often generate good results and should be tried first. an increase of radius or amount reinforce the effect. if you create the insharpness mask will make noise and the impression of grats in the proximity of sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius represents one like many pixels on each side of a edges by the filter. high-resolution images allow bigger radii. they should therefore sharpen images best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the caught image that is added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The swelling value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference. you can thus define a minimum difference for a edges of the filter. in this way, areas will be avoided with a soft change between killing and therefore beauty errors in faces, celestial and water-surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the blurred masking filter. the original image is the (1) and the edited picture the (2). blurred masking was used with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a sponge = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digitization; tool refocused on a picture by improving the edge. it used to be protected by protected unfolding filter by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries to make a picture & quot; refocused quot; in which it is a better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it is using a technique called FIR Wiener Filtering. the traditional technique on the sharpening of images is the use of an insharpness mask. you can start it from the menu by calling colors Refocused in the editing process.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice the circular fly has much better than the gauge's fission. the Gauß'sche Faltung has a very long tail, which leads far from the original pixel, which depends far from the original pixel. the FIR Wiener Inverse of the Gauß'schen Faltung is influenced in most cases even very strongly influenced by the distant pixel. the causes unwanted results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of circular folding. it is the most important parameter for the use of this module. for most images the default value should result 1 good results. you can put a higher value when your image is very blurred, but then on halo.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help to reduce artefacts. the correlation can be chosen from 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and the values close 1, & eg; 0,95 and 0.99. a high value for correlation reduces the sharpening effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Rauschfilter: an increase in the spacing filter can help you to reduce artifacts. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, & eg; 0 the image quality is very bad. a high value is 0.03. a high value will continue the picture even further.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauge's sharpness: this is the radius for the gauge's edge. use this parameter when your insharpness is caused. in most cases, you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying artefacts. if you use a value unequal zero, you might need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformationmatrix. an increase in the matrix size can create good results, especially if you select large values for the circular sharpness or the gauge's sharpness. however, note that the module will be very slow if you choose large values for this parameter. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">Saving as well as store buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any reproduction parameter which you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to perform all the cuts, color and intensity corrections on the picture before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that a lot of operations changes that are not immediately visible, which left unpleasant artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you read images and compressed, & eg; as JPEG, you should use the module on the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, blurred masking produced better results as sharpness. this could be caused by blurred masking a larger neighbourhood used as sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically, blurred masking must always produce artifacts. even under optimal conditions it can never show the effect of the sharpness. for the Wiener filter you can show that it is the optimal Lineare filter at least as good as the insharpness mask. the FIR Wiener Filter is often better in editing of small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters, on a small unfocused image, see:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp colour image has to be corrected. this image has been made with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for auto-focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the methods of the approach in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English at this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The regulator Glätte sets the insharpness of the area that was darkened, in order to generate a more natural pupille.</seg>
<seg id="514">The shade offers a adapted color for the Pupille. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, then you can adjust it here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool imaging is one of the most developed tool to remove not desired artefacts with an unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImpact Project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various presets as starter points to simplify the restoration. the available preferences are indicated below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filtering settings fine, you can use the rider glacial and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail posture p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to a evenly smoothing about the image. a value of 0.9 should obtain details so that no sharpenalties is necessary to obtain. please note that the detailed information is always subordinated to the right-dependence.</seg>
<seg id="520">Breath-dependent Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes in all directions, while a value is close to 1 only in one direction. if you have a film granular or CCD Rauschen will produce a high value in wave-like pattern. JPEG artifacts are best placed at a value close to 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smooth [0, 500]: this puts the maximum smoothing factor above alles. then defines the relative smoothing. set this value therefore suitable to the degree of smoking in your picture.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is pressed, as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture. even if you want to produce a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: returns on how often the algorithm is passed. normally, here is 1 or 2.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle-wide da [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropen Alpha. if alpha is small chosen, there should be also small to create a long run time. so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to suit your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral stepper [0,1, 10]: integral stepper in pixels. you should set the value of smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never bigger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear interpolation use: the enhanced quality that you get through choice of this option is only low. he doubles but the term. we therefore recommend it to let him go.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons save as well as loading make exactly this. any setting of image errors can correct this into a text file and be loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Image errors correct comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take very long and take a high CPU load after it. you can therefore break the calculation with the button down at any time.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how picture errors can be corrected with Small artefacts. the module is made in a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you see, there is a peculiar black arteact in the foreground that caused by a bad film storage during the journey is caused (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digitization: noise reduction is a very powerful tool to decrease images. it uses a copyrighted algorithm of Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artifacts that come from dust or hair on the lens, too. it can also be used to remove sensor ruffles from the camera or Moiers; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need further information on Sensor cameras from digital cameras, you can read this in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a granular noise which can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you will only need the subwindow details and the subwindow advanced settings can remain with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large values increase the time the filters are needed per pixel and can get the image into it. the image specified by the radius is moving over the picture and the color in it gets smoothed and therefore minor bugs.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the edge-level. this value sets the pixelabducted the filter to be ascertained. if it is lifted up the edges of the filter. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter picture details can no longer receive and noise or blacksmith occurs again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the tightening accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong can not occur the entire noise or smokes you can occur. put it on a value close to the maxim if you want to remove a faint smoking or JPEG-artefacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance of the image. we recommend either color or luminance to change in order to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process which is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the tolerant tolerance of the picture. we recommend either color or luminance to change in order to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process which is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gammatolerance of the picture. this value can be used to increase the tolerance-values of the darker areas, which typically are more rough to increase. it also cuts the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Vapour: controls the adjusting filter radius on variations of the luminance. if it is lifted up, the edges may appear. if it is too high can be a mier, smoking and phasenjitter appear to the edges. he can remove hammers and is the recommended method for it.</seg>
<seg id="542">Store under and store: these buttons are used exactly for this. all parameters for the noise reduction you have set can be stored in the filesystem and later loaded.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how smoking reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2). the noise reduction was applied with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too chilly for your purpose. the solution to draw the image a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to sharpen. use the tool to softness with the menu entry corrigidity and experiment with the smoothing. the passing on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digious; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photographs of photographs.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artefacts about your images. he is very well adapted to remove gauge's colored, scratches, compressing, compressing, compressing, compressing, compressing, compressing, compressing, composites, and thereby maintains the content as well as the human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for color and text composition. the text composition is carried out with another tool, the image infallic, carried out. the algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / Frannoses and is part of the CImpact Project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG artifacts reduce: the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far away from it. as a lossy Compressed Compressed; - small standards that are shown in uncompressed image. this setting should correct these issues.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons Save as and store make exactly this. any setting of photo restoration can therefore be saved into a text file and later recharged.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo-restoration is comparatively very fast during work. however, it can take very long and take a high CPU load after it. you can therefore break the calculation with the button at any time.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can reduce as a photo with the like-shaped smoke.. The module is applied to a black and white photo that has been recorded with a Minolta (tm) HP-5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the infamous film granules on the faces. the original image is under (1) and the corrected under (2) to see.</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time, textures was reduced to an old color photo that has been read with a scanner. you can see the scan artefacts that were caused by the Scannerlights and the photo paper. the original image is below (1) to see and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digitization; tool hotbed permits it hotbed of photos that were done with a CCD camera, eight were to remove. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project, protected by Martin Dickens.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, tote or hot pixels are particularly high-quality raw mode photos a problem because many cameras with JPEG compression over a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixel quot; and "quot; bright pixelquot; in a photo with a dark picture method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the wizard with the button 'button. the tool will detect automatic and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the preview show.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it is important that you will contact the dark picture directly in connection to discover new hot or bright pixels through CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First as described in the previous section, you should download the appropriate dark image to the corrected picture. a automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels. note that the wizard shows the last blue picture and this automatically invites you to the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and the preview will help you to correct the result within the picture. the default shows the output of the filter with the current settings. poor pixels are raised in all occurrenditions.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area around the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. select afterwards the best filter method to interpoled these pixel errors. these are the available filters:</seg>
<seg id="561">Duration: it is determined an average of the neighboring block. the resulting color will be assigned to all the defective pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation this is done separately for horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a gap of 1 of pixel block, are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linearen curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpoled the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filtermethod. all pixels with a gap of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim) which then is used to interpoled the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cuban: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi-Cuban surface (2-dim) or a group of Cuban curves (1-dim) which then is used to interpoled the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the hotbed correction on a color foto, from a faulty digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original image was increased to 300% (1) and the corrected picture is below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digitization: vignettifying correction is a tool to correct the Vigrting, i.e. underexposed corners, an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Vastly objects, especially those in the middle and large photo format, can often illuminate the entire sensor range. instead & quot; vignetscape quot; (shaded) they can reduce the corners and edges of the image, by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there. teleobjects show under circumstances also this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">But he also has disadvantages. many center-filters require a factor 1.5 or 2 with aperture filter, which is impossible to keep the camera with hand. vastly objects should also use with center filters, an opening of f / 16 or small, as otherwise unblur effects arise by movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the great exposure areas of today's film and the shades of digital cameras and film scanner, it is possible to simulate the effect of a centerfilter by using an equivalent transformation of a raw filter, which is applied without this filter. the tool Vignet filter is applied to a picture. the algorithm is copyrighted by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three controllers, you can control the vignettifying filter and with three more the exposure of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light gravity at the point of the biggest density the filter. the standard density is 2,0, resulting from an optical filter with a aperture angle of 1, or randomly a light intensity of 2, entsprang, reduce it to compensate for a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Leuchool, contrast and gamma settings: the editing of an image with the Vignettifying correction is reduced the luminosity of the pixels. you need to readjust the exposure of the target image using these options. the regulator will only provide positive values because you only need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a fine replenum of the exposure of the target image, so let the values for illuminance / contrast / gamma with zero and use the Gradation from the & digitization; image processing from the menu color Gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the Vignettifying correction to a picture. the original image (1) shows the corrected picture. a luminance and contrasting correction was also carried out in the image with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digitization; Linsenverdistortion is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. colored distortions cannot be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second gradient treats the general geometric distortion of the lens, and can correct the concave or conical shape of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third gradient has a similar circuit effect, flap but at the edges. this correction is not used in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient fourth grades corrected the distant corners to the second grading. if you combine these two can be eliminated any geometric distortion almost eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">Generally: this value controls the strength of the distortion of the second grading. with negative values, tons can be corrected, and positive values can be distorted.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of the distortion fourth grading. this value affects the edges as in the middle of the picture. for most lenses the 'corners parameter has the inverted precursor of the parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value scaled the image size and thus leads to a correction first gradient by. negative values enlarge as positive the image resized.</seg>
<seg id="583">Bright: this value adjust the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image into the corners, while positive values they increase.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialog with a preview the distortion procedure. the values you use for your image are stored and used at the next start as standard values.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tons or coloscized correction should be performed prior to all trimmer - or size changes. the best way to cut this correction as all first. if you do a picture anew, and then perform a tons-shaped correction, the effect is apparent from the falsile.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction, this tool provides a vertical and horizontal relief line. move it to an important place, such as the sea edge or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. afterwards, you can fix the lines / kcipher distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you have a cold-shaped distortion, the resulting image is black corners. you can transform them into the menu using the cutting tool in the menu or remove it from the image processing or on the zoom regulator of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">For most pictures, the tons-shaped correction is enough. the next logical step for some motives like e.g. recordings from the front, frame and painting, it's the perspective to correct the all angles in the image 90 degrees. note that if you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the low-shaped correction to a church in Norway. the original image is under (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate infrared film of the implied belts, which is available under this URL. the filter reproduces the known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfrared film, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity area of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left of the window you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can simulate two parameters set film granularity and film sensitivity. the ISO regulator changes the amount of film granularity and the dominance of the color green (chlorophyll in nature) in conversion. green meadows are white as snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">As the filter color channels for reproducing infrared film misses, especially the green canal makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white-photos, as the color informations are missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of infrared film effects applied to a landscape photo taken from New Zealand. the original image is under (1) and the edited picture below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values generate a kind of aura in the shreddish.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digitization: filter film-drying is a simple to use tool to reproduce films of images on your images. this is known by classic high-speed filter, such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X, known to increase the sensitivity of the movies, the manufacturers big silgranules of the photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film-graffing effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past. the treated picture gets a timeless atmosphere loosed from everyday life. if you want to use this special, gallery-like, rocky sight especially in your monochrome photos, you need to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the regulator, the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of the Körner. the default value is, although often higher values are needed to apply to ISO-2400. if you need even more grains, you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of film granular effects applied to a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and the working (2). the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digitization: filter oil gemälde creates the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyright protected protected algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digitization: filter oil gemälde gives your digital images a nice appearance like an oil painting. natural images and styles are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two regulators to influence this effect. the top selects the brush size between one and five. thicker brush are suitable for great pictures. glare controlled the smoothing or, from the other side, the uniqueness.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with the (1) and the original is marked with the (2). brush size for this 640 pixel large picture is 1 and smoote 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digitization; filter carbon drawing uses color and integers to create a Kohlk. therefore the images whose gradient can change slowly are therefore not ideal for this effect. it's helpful if you would like to imagine what scene you would have chosen to scure you. this would be good pictures to start with it.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two regulator with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper angler selects the pin size and the lower shifted the contrast (smoothing).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of coherence filter. the original image (1) and the modified image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be improved by adjustment of the intensity.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digious; filter engraver shapes your image in 3-D as if it was cracked in wax. it is used to include a copyrighted algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digitization: filter engraving is a fast tool to give your pictures with a 3-D effect. he works especially well with pictures with a simple structure where color is not the most important thing about the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray, mondared landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows the contrast of the filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the edited picture (2). the depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a artwork by means of distortion effects. it uses protected algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wavelength 1: shares the image in cells and let it look as if it is considered by means of glassesses.</seg>
<seg id="612">Shaft blocks 2: analog to the shaft blocks 1, the image is distorted here in a different version of glassware.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel this effects at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filtering group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork using insharpness effects. it uses protected algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom insharpness: wipes the picture along static lines that go from a center. this simulates the insharpness a zooming camera and produces a dynamic expression of the often seen in the sport photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial insharpness: wit the picture by rotation of the pixels by a center. this simulates the insharpening of a revolting camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Removal of removal: wipes the image to create the effect of a not focused camera lens. the object seems to step back in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Restraint: wiped out the picture by horizontal movements of the pixels. this simulates the insharpening of a linear movable, z: B: from a car or train photographing, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Softening insharpness: wiped the image soft into the dark and strong in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and glorious soft focusing effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamor photos or to add a warm and subtle bulbs.</seg>
<seg id="620">Schüttelblurfe: wipes the picture with random shift of the pixels and simulates the sharpness of an arbitrary camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent sharpness: find the colour basins in the picture and caught it without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: shares the photo in rectangular cells and then created it by filling with an average pixel value.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel this calculation anytime with the button.</seg>
<seg id="624">The rain drops are a cute little tool to make rain drops in your picture. this makes it natural your images a good appearance. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn copyrighted algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Drip size allows it to change the size of the drip. since the droplet size does not grow automatically with the size of the image, it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images. quantity changes the number and density of drops. fishing changes the optical effect of drops in the image.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can use the & digitization; image editing a area-free from rain drops. use the selection tool to choose the area, e.g. a face that should remain free. if you start the filter rain drops the area will remain free of rain drops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of rain drops. the original image (1) shows a quiet sunset and the edited picture (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, so you can bring it through mirrors or turning into the correct orientation. the tools can be transformed in the menu transforming dirt or transform spider.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo inflatable is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimum loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">A picture to resist is simple. the big question is how can you keep an image inflatable and the details are sharp? how can you find the missing information again or guess? how can you find the missing information again or guess? the CImg algorithm that is used here, here is a good job. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. select to change the size in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog is below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool to adjust the size uses a linear interpolation method to enlarge the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality, then try the tool to inflatable.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image processing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. spline Interpolation to enlarge an image. & checking; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo inflating was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImpact Project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You must tell the tool as you want to change the size. these settings are available in the rider New size and are displayed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Aspect ratio: when this setting is activated, when entering the new size the aspect ratio of the original image is maintained.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is pressed, as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture. even if you want to produce a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The buttons Save as and store are used exactly for this. any insertion for photo can enlarge as text file and later recharged.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo inflating is very fast with what it does, but it can still take very long and take a high CPU load after getting off. you can cancel calculation with the button at any time.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example of picture inflating by adding a small color picture to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the preview (2) is the result of the linear standard magnification compared to the comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">Cutting of a photo is not only a frequently performed surgery but also a frequently underestimated tool to put together a picture. the image editing allows you to simply drag the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and drag the rectangle, create. you will see this rectangle then while you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">When you release the mouse button again, the area of photos will be cut off. this gives you a good overview how your photo would look after cutting. you can change the size of the rectangle by clicking on the corners of the rectangle. a new rectangle can create by simply drag it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cutting button, use the button The Ctrl-button of the image processing in the toolbar and the photo is designed (Ctrl; + X). use the file saved or save file saved in the menu file to save the newly cropped picture.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview area, you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio that you have defined in dialogue will remain.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool After aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as high-format or cross-format. the high format is always assigned to the larger value of height and in cross-format width.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool After aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio. this means it is always the same, irrespective of whether you use centimeters, Inch or any other physical size. you can e.g. see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog there are two buttons around the selection automatically horizontal or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">Below the dialog you can set up with the Max. ratio button to the area to access to the greatest possible, depending on the chosen relationship and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool After aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the orientation orientation (horizontal or vertical). if you use the cutting tool the next time, these settings are displayed as standard values depending on the orientation. the modified picture dimensions are displayed in the EXIF tables so that the EXIF data are reflected in the EXIF data and do not reflect the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the replacements allow help to blended up so that you can put your images better. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonious dividing are based on the principle of similarity. as the third-hedgehogs, harmonic triangles are a possibility to split a rectangle in similar harmonical triangles on the diagonals.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden center: the golden center is a division which extends to various natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus pussy, or the flakes of a sunflower. it appears in all possible things that we feel as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden division is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was already used in the ancient Egyptians and Greeks who built your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden division in all times when you put your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is derived from Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 8, 8, 34, 34 & etc; from where each number is equal to 1 equal to the sum of their two previous numbers. the resulting subsection is 1: 1.618 the golden center. a composition which this rule is followed as visually harmoniously.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center provides fluids lines. if you put an image together, these help will be raised below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spiral spiral will bring you good results to your goal. compared to third-regel, the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the picture. this type of composition leads the view of the beholder along the line of spiral and creates on this type a symmetrical visual flow.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called Golden orthography. there should be something that the eye can be at the center of the composition. this may be a line or different objects. this something can just be there without the eye to guide it will fulfill its task.</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golfe triangles also derive from the above-colored golden spiral. their vertices are the middle-points of the pages of the golden rectangle. note that in contrast to harmonious triangles, golden triangles are not equal triangles. diagonal to place these lines can place a static object dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">When you use golden triangles to break up your frame create an effect of professional photographer dynamic Symmetry. try to place your image asset on one of the cutting points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve differently.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options horizontally mirror and vertical mirror can be used to mirror the harmonic part.</seg>
<seg id="660">The button color allows you to set the color of the Help lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the auxiliary lines can be invisible. in this way you can customize the color of the lines of your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The free rotation is a tool to rotate an image to any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you do a photo, then it happens easily that you're not exactly vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which the things have turned out an angle. you can repair this with the bed; image editing and the tool free rotation. select to transform free rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Turning your image with the slider angle. the values on this slider are indicated in degrees. with the button presets you can put the slider again to 0 degrees. a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the picture are shown on the right above.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the module turns free rotation a horizontal and a vertical line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to position the two lines. after you fix it over an important point of the picture, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have shot a picture you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. a way to fix this is to transform it the function transformation from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is Automatically cutting. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The anti-aliasing option smoothes the picture a bit after rotation. however, note that the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspectivic transformations are carried out by a fixed point of the so-called reference point. this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares to the corners of your image. the preview will then automatically be recharged. on the right of the dialog you will find some information which help you to change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: displays the width of the new image, including the empty areas created by transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: displays the height of the new image, including the empty areas created by transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle left: displays the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed territory.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle on the top right: displays the current angle in degrees at the top right of the transformed territory.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle on the left below: displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed territory.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle on the right below: displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed territory.</seg>
<seg id="676">According to the adaptation of the perspective the image becomes a little wasted. for a single adaptation this effect is small but two adjustments create a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have adapted the perspective, you get unwanted triangular holes in the corners. a way to bersome it is the image with transforming cutting from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The estimation tool is used to move a part of the image in a direction and move the other part into the opposite. this is no spin, the image will be distorted. in other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallelogram. you can start this module over transform scrolling.</seg>
<seg id="679">Push your image using the horizontal angle and vertical angle. you can push horizontally and vertically at the same time. if you push on preference, the angle on zero will be shown. a preview of the effect will display you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed on the right of the display area.</seg>
<seg id="680">To your help, a vertical and horizontal line appears. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have carried out the shots, the picture becomes a bit wisely. for a single shing this effect is usually neglected, but two shots generated twice as much bluring and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After closing, the image has unbeautiful triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate this is to cut the image with transforming cutting from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& checking; needs a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. therefore, the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries compiling. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of imaging rate with & digitization.</seg>
<seg id="684">Because of this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on their system. however, you will always find JPEG and TIFF.</seg>
<seg id="685">& checking; displays only files in formats which knows. this happens based on the file extension and a comparison of these with a pre-defined list. if the extension has been listed in the list, the file will be displayed in the image editing. you can change this list of file extensions. in the section configuration you will find further information on this.</seg>
<seg id="686">Almost all digital cameras save photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras allow you to select even the format used. a more detailed description of this file formats you can find in Wikipedia. & checking; supports both formats.</seg>
<seg id="687">Image compression is the application of data compression to digital images. thereby, redundant information is reduced to store the image data on a more efficient way.</seg>

<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in doubt, you should leave them black. the name and path of the created file can be set under name of the MPEG output file. keep in mind as possible as possible.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify a audio file under name of audio source file, this will be integrated into the movie. depending on the button encoding code you can start with the button encoding. depending on the speed of your computer you can now take a cup of coffee and enjoy the diaschau when you are back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a note appears that Kodiers or tools are missing, you can adjust the paths to the programs of the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages on the right bottom right below.</seg>
<seg id="852">The printer wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photosizes. the combined images can also be automatically opened by image processing Gimp. this is e.g: sensible to print you or print the Gimp module for direct expression.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module you can import and convert your images stored in one of three formats of JPEG, TIFF, or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command line tool dcraw from Dave Coffin. an original image of Him is: expect from dcraw not that it creates the same results as the software from your camera manufacturers. sometimes you get better results with dcraw better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the raw file to be converted and start the module. the Raw image konverter window appears in mode for a single image. with the button preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the image.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now readjust the values to the conversion process. the first option decides whether the camera settings are to be used for the white-off. the essential parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifier can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal you can edit the picture later on.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be chosen so that you can use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switches has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion results. the filename remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The Equitable Image format, TIFF, keeps all the information of your image and uses the lossfree LZW compressing.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you are planning to use your pictures frequently, or later you don't want to use the JPEG format, since it is only a limited number of operations, the image quality is deteriorating. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you choose JPEG as a storage format, the metadata in the raw file are stored in the JPEG file in the EXIF data.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adjusted your settings, you can start using the button button to start the conversion. if you want to cancel this process again, you can break down.</seg>
<seg id="863">The stacking mode allows you to convert various images to once. use this mode therefore if you are sure, for example through testing in a single image, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images. however, this is helpful if they have been created in an earlier trial. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar is not available as far the conversion is advanced.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to recompress all images in one album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used for renaming all images of an album. you can set the prefix, the starting number and the timestamp of the ones shall set.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a picture collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick Package. you can make the picture resized or enlarge.</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal changes in a dimension. the width or height of the image is automatically selected, depending on the image orientation, selected. the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. here the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option e.g. to adjust your image to the screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: not disproportionate size in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed during this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Printing preparation: prepares the image for the photo printing. the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photopapiers. the target image, including background size, size and background color, is adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected pictures with your preferred e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the first pictures previously. further images can be drawn on the list of images and discard them there.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you started the module, the images window will be displayed with the images selected by you. you can add further images using a file selector dialog. for the last displayed picture, a preview will be displayed on the right.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag pictures to the picture list and take it in order to add images to the list of images.</seg>
<seg id="875">The pictures will remove pictures from the list of images to be removed.</seg>
<seg id="876">Once you have selected all images you can open the new message -window of your e-mail clients. you only need to add the addresses and the subject to your e-mail. the images you selected have already been attached to the appendix.</seg>
<seg id="877">Be sure to send out too many pictures at one time. most e-mail accounts have restrictions on the size of answering e-mails. it may be a good idea to send several mails when you want to send many pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window will be used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration is saved and every time re-used until you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail clients from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field below.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail service, you must install the GMailAgent on your computer before using the GMailAgent. you can download this here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After the selection of comments in a specified file, the comments to the pictures will be added together into a text file and attached the mail.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the menu images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted among the lossfree formats such as TIFF. therefore, you should not use PNG if you have a quick Internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise we recommend you the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG using images file format and select the original files in the JPEG format, then the original Exifdata are added to the dends.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is finished, the window will not be closed automatically so you can view the status messages, in search of errors, can view. your e-mail program will be started automatically at the end. with the button Connect, you can fold this window? en.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the module's advanced Diaschau, a window with questions like you would like to have shown your slideshow. you can choose from here between the chosen and all the images of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The option OpenGL transitions in the presentation uses a very elegant picture-transitions by OpenGL. however, you need to have an appropriate graphics card, since otherwise the diaschau will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The filename option indicate that the file name of the images are displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The loop loop ensures that the presentation is displayed in an end loop. you can then manually cancel it with Esc.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option pictures randomly select that the images are displayed in a random order. so it will not be the order of the images used in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">Among the pictures between the pictures can be set the temporal distance between the individual pictures. 1500 milliseconds match 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and your chosen transition effect. so you should show that before you show the presentation to your friends!</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transitions between which you can choose. accidentally, choosing a different effect during each transition between the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the diaschau you can access a toolbar at the top left side of the screen. move the mouse in this corner to turn on you.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar you can hold the presentation and start again, jump to the previous and the next picture and stop the slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="894">At the left side of the screen you can see the current filename, the position of the current picture and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module Time & Date has currently no documentation. if you are interested in writing them, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI teams under KDE Imaging @ kde.org. notice: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module background image is a tool to set a picture as a background image for the working surface.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module sets the currently selected image, depending on the chosen option of the submenu, as a background for your KDE labels.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have provided your pictures and videos with notes, you can see with & kphotoalbum, see picture. as you can see by a comparison with the image, are now available in each group, so in individuals, places and in group keywords entries.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window you will see the categories, for which you have entered information as you have provided your pictures and videos with annotations. additionally, there are entries to look for EXIF-based information, to view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course the current thumbnails. in the following, each is described for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="900">When you press the mouse on the entry, the view of the browser is changing. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you choose to select another person only the images are displayed on which both individuals are visible. through this selection method you can restrict the number of images displayed from a few thousand images to a few individual images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all the persons, places and other settings, you can view with thumbnails to view the images of your degree.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture every person has the same symbol in front of her name. however, you can save with & kphotoalbum; however, for each person a separate preview image, this also applies to places, keywords and other categories that you have defined yourself. see the picture.</seg>
<seg id="904">To view images in addition to the name, select the button that you want to use on the right outside on the toolbar. this has the advantage that you can display the view for each category. this has the advantage that you can display for example symbols with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords can be displayed (if you do not have appropriate pictures for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">You must also specify which image for each individual person is to be displayed. to view this, you'll have to select the image-in window (in detail) and select in the context menu item you can customize the image factor according to your wishes and thus choose which part of the image is to be shown or cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">When you access the entry in the main window, you will see a dialog that is very similar to the dialog for the fixing of the image properties. this dialog can look at the picture again.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string into the box or description, the captions and descriptions of images will be searched for this text. if you like, you can also choose a date that should be searched for example, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two data, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the lower part of the window you can browse all images according to certain names as you can see in the picture. here is according to pictures, on which Jesper, but not Anne Helene are pictured.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user's manual for & kphotoalbum;. if you do not like to read handbooks, but rather try to try out functions, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & kphotoalbum; and take a look at the quickening, the screenshot and the introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & kphotoalbum; and select in the first dialog the demo, in case you start & kphotoalbum; for the first time, or select in the menu Help menu entry album; -Demo. subsequently, some sample pictures will be loaded and you can try the features of & kphotoalbum; try.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, you will find it on the homepage of & kphotoalbum; as a related HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & kphotoalbum; see the timeline. a picture of this bar see here:. as the name suggests, this body shows you data statistics about the images in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The timeline can display several different timings. each body shows a different unit. you can change between the units of years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the lyste only 10-minute headings.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline can use it on the following ways: you can change the displayed records preview view from the database (if you select a date, the first image of this date in the preview displayed) and also shows the timeline always displayed the current date of the currently displayed pictures when you navigate in the Preview View.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select a section of the timeline by holding the mouse button pressed and the mouse over the ruler of the timeline, i.e. record information, will display you in the preview view only images of this time period. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a beam of the timeline.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kphotoalbum; puts you two possibilities to create HTML websites with your images; the one is available in & kphotoalbum; integrated and the other as a module available (see). in the following part of the user's manual, which is described in & kphotoalbum; integrated version that you can create about the File HTML menu.</seg>
<seg id="918">Before HTML pages, you need to make some settings. these are divided into the three areas content, layout and finish. in the following, each area is described more accurately.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the blicks and a description which should contain the HTML file later. on a photoalbum, HTML-example pages you will see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next select whether a & kphotoalbum; -Export file will be created, which is to be seen on the overview page. nutritional information on export files can be found in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Finally, you can select which information is displayed on the HTML pages. therefore, you can avoid that information is displayed on the viewer. for example, all pictures of a party are obvious. note that all pictures are exported from a party. you can therefore not use this attitude to hide certain images from certain views.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are clearly, which is not specifically received on these pages.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can view different resolutions for the images. this means that those who have viewing your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600, no images can download the resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The spectator of your site can change the resolution at any time you fixed. so he can search your images with low resolution, which leads to a lower transmission time, so if he wants to see a picture bigger, he changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting, you put the different folders and URL where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">You are best to select a base folder for all your HTML files and a new subfolder for each subsequent set.</seg>
<seg id="927">First, you need to select the main folder in which all of your images are saved. this folder will be saved and automatically added at the next time. this folder allows you to select either a folder or one of KDE supported protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your pictures, you can check if these really are all for viewers. if you were created for the base folder a URL, after the pages have been created, this folder should be here. otherwise the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder, you need to manually copy them. so that the import function, see, properly functions you need to specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the basic folders in which all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The just described settings have all three on the base folders and URLs related. in this one subfolder is laid out, whose name you set up in output folders.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you're talking about a family party, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbum; you might want to create an HTML page to view the images. if you have already spent quite a lot of time to consider the images, reception location, etc. then you have to do with & kphotoalbum; this work doesn't even have to do.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kphotoalbum; you can export a copy of your images to a .kim file. you can import others into your database. the image features will be imported with exams and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in whether the images are stored in the file or if the file is only a link to pictures. the advantage of all images contained in the file is that you have all the images together, and that file can be passed independently. the obvious disadvantage is however the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can edit a .kim file either directly from the File menu or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file along with a HTML file, this will create an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file searches the images in two ways. first, the images are displayed in the folder of .kim file. if the corresponding pictures are not found, so the images are specified in the folder of the .kim file. this is of course only possible if you have created your .kim file using HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, the dialog is described for exporting images that you can access the File Expore menu.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it is to act internal or external .kim files. the following three choices are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">If you prefer to copy the images to the .kim file, you need to copy the images in the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the option Automatically in the vicinity of the .kim-file copy and kphotoalbum; the images are automatically copied for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. because most images have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself very small is worth it usually not compress the files. if you want this nevertheless, you simply select the option export file.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is to limit maximum image size. if you want to send your friends pictures, you might not want to limit the images in full size, because the .kim file is otherwise very large. here you can say the size, by example, that every picture should be at most 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the menu file Impore... selecting, will import & kphotoalbum; the exported database as described in it.</seg>
<seg id="943">The wizard for importers consists of four steps. first, you need to select which images you want to import, then in which folders to import images to be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you personalize the category of persons of the file personer (if you are a Dane), while this category is called for your database. therefore, you will be imported in the third dialog box, which categories of the imported file should be imported into your database and which categories are to be imported into your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step you can import the categories of imported file with the categories of your current database. one example will see you on the image.</seg>
<seg id="946">It has to be easy to browse and viewing images: if you look at images, you often want to view pictures of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend on it, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is pictured.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this handbook, you will find the different steps from (1) fixed the information about your images, via (2) to search through (2) advanced topics and adaptations.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoalbum was started as a program for managing your images. it has been extended and today, it also takes care of your videos. in many places in this handbook will be talked about pictures, but frequently this also closes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kphotoalbum; saves all of his information in the file index.xml in the top folder of their images. this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice, e.g. normal backup tools, copy to a floppy disk or revisions in CVS, where they want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kphotoalbum; notice the folder in which your images are stored and used automatically. if you want to start another database in & kphotoalbum; so if you want to start another folder tree with pictures, you can start & kphotoalbum; with the option -c. as an example: kphotoalbum -c ~ / Company / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Via the menu entry menu button, set up... you can get to a window with which you can change the settings of & photo album; in the following sections of the user manual, you will find the various settings options.</seg>
<seg id="952">At the left you can see six different symbols, with which you can access settings options and options for the viewer. for each setting, a detailed help is available, which you can call through a button on the F1 key and a click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It was described in you how you can set various properties, e.g. persons, places and keywords for each image. you can also create your own groups such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">You can see dialogue which is used to work already existing groups. for each existing group you can select a lettering and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section categories, subcategories were already mentioned. in the dialog options, you can set up complete membership groups, i.e., e.g. all members of a group at once in a group rather than in a group.</seg>
<seg id="956">In view of the settings, which are available to you for fixing the members of the members. with the above listed list, you can select the category you want to configure. in the left of Fenals, you can find a list of the current categories and in the right a list of categories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kphotoalbum; shares his modular system with other graphic applications such as the KIPI and Gwenview. this module is called KIPI and means & KDE; image plugin interface. nutritional information can be found on the website of Kipi.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be accessed via the menu modules. the modules can and are not described in this manual as they are not part of & kphotoalbum; however, but most modules have a help page that you can access via the modules itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules of multiple applications can be used together, it may be that the modules with & kphotoalbum. therefore, you should always test new modules first with the demo database before you access it to your own images. demo version -demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the menu Help. say not, I would not have warned you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use the modules above KIPI, are very different, making it possible that some modules with & kphotoalbum; do not work. this is the disadvantage if you share functions with various applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & kphotoalbum; and other applications that also use KIPI, is that the other applications simply use their images into albums: this kind of order is not supported, simulates it for some modules the order after albums, so you can use the features with & kphotoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="962">Thereby simulates & kphotoalbum; the current album, which simply corresponds to the current view, thus all images, which show you the pictured look at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="963">In addition to the current album, & kphotoalbum, the modules also has to pass a list of albums. here is the photo album follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kphotoalbum; s Browser shows the content of a category, for example all persons, then each entry of this category represents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will be the category that you have defined in the menu dialog as category for virtual albums, so if you use the category Persons, will do it, so if you have chosen individuals to view and to share this module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & kphotoalbum; not compatible are you to remove them from the list of modules. start the settings dialog, and select the modules that modules are loaded.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you will see an example of a starting screen when you start & kphotoalbum; with your own images.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used it from any other KDE application, you will see the window with which you have entered the window with which you have entered your image database. in the section we will not find out any information about your images, but in the section we will show you an overview of all existing images to show you an overview of all existing images.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & kphotoalbum; is the possibility to view every picture with notes, where the image was recorded, etc. you can set each image either individually or for a larger number of images certain notes at the same time. if for example, on all pictures Jesper, and all pictures were recorded in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these notes can be used for searching and browsing, as you can read in the section. if you want you can see these notes if you use the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">In view of three lists of a text field by choosing people, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphotoalbum; because you will always use them again if you want to use information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea lies the moving of images inside the list: if you have shown for example a family party and shown on all 50 pictures the same 5-10 persons, you can see that the used names are moved up, the people can find faster and arrange.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to get an alphabetical list displayed, click on the symbol for sorting by date under the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected comments for each image individually, you might want to edit any selected pictures and provided them with a comment. click in this case simply to the above and back buttons, which are underneath the thumbnail on the right.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have multiple images, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more convenient to mark all these images and to use the menu item multiple entries at once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA. there are also San Francisco and Los Angeles in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">In the picture you will see a browser window that displays the USA as a supergroup. to view you that it is a supergroup, a special symbol is shown.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the menu feature, you can add an entry to an existing or new over- or subcategory. additionally, you can also drop a entry into a category and take up there to make this one subcategory of this entry. attention, this requires that you just sort out your categories alphabetically. see this.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can postpone the individual elements of the issue, by moving the edge, which form the edge of the frames, click and move. you can also make a separate window from a frame to pull it out of the window range.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adjusted the look of the window to your needs, you are satisfied with the settings, click on the button options... which offers you the possibility to save the current structure and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also hide a frame completely. if you want to see this window again later, use the button options... and then you will see windows a / hide. this process can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">When you select the entry pictures in the browser, you will get an overview with thumbnails of the currently selected images, or any images in case you have no filter. you can configure the size of the thumbnails, by simply clicking the mouse button with the middle mouse button, configure. try it simply times.</seg>
<seg id="983">When you drop a picture on the background of your desktop, this picture is furnished as background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture, this is displayed in the picture frame. if you have not opened any window with an image press, a new scoreboard will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete images from the thumbnail. simply select the appropriate images from which you want to delete and select either the removal button or select in the Edit menu. now, you will see the window that you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& kphotoalbum; offers you a solution for this problem. you can also use pictures without saving you on your hard drive. of course you have to save the images somewhere, so that you can record the pictures somewhere. in the picture you can see the view of & kphotoalbum; if not all required images can be loaded from the disk.</seg>
<seg id="987">Images, where the right upper corner is cut, are not stored on the hard disk. however, for example, the thumbnails are available for example. for the pictures 5-9, however, the thumbnails will show you. however, the preview of these images can be displayed. however, you can also look at these pictures with the image.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you see, this function needs you to copy files from folders and again. & kphotoalbum; supports it until now, not to request the insertion of the relevant CD. if you want to avoid trouble how to avoid the mess of your images, please buy a bigger hard drive to save all images on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the menu pictures you will find a submenu with your name privacy. if you want to have a little more privacy, filter the pictures so that you want to make for other inaccessible, and click on current view inside the menu privacy. alternatively, you can also see all pictures that may see your little sister, ansteuers and the menu entry everything except actual view.</seg>
<seg id="990">This means you have specified which images are to be hidden in the case of the case. if you give the laptop now your little sister, simply select the menu entry images, which will have locked up, which you have locked up, click lock to lift up.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to specify a password that needs to be entered in order to set up the images. to set up this password, simply select the password in the menu privacy.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please bear in mind that this picture protection is not very safe at any time. for one there is all the images on the hard drive and on the other one can easily read or delete the password as unencrypted text. this type of password protection serves only to those who are familiar with & kphotoalbum; not very familiar to rectify the view of private pictures.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason why you can manage all of your pictures with & kphotoalbum; naturally manage and hours over hours to describe it is of course that you want to look at them at some time. for this reason, you can see them at some time. this is why you can preview out a picture _ and video clip. you can preview them from the preview as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">The observer you can see in. of course it shows the image, but additional all the information you want to enter over the picture, such as who is on the picture when and where was it done, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the Infobox on the upper part of the picture you want to see, you can easily drag and drop it out elsewhere. you can also configure what information is displayed and whether information is displayed. all these options are displayed after a right-click on the viewer. you can see the context menu, you can see below.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the Infobox are underlined. if you click here on the browser, see the appropriate entries to this display. so if you click to Anne Helene, the browser shows you all pictures of Anne Helene. as if you were people from the browser and then Anne Helene chose.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have loaded multiple pictures in the viewer, you can switch between them and use the buttons picture high and image. you can jump to the first and last image with Pos1 and end. these features can also be reached from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If multiple images are loaded in the viewer, you can run it as diaschau. then a new image can load a few seconds. how often it load a new image can be controlled by pressing the Ctrl key and plus or minus. started and stopped the diaschau through the buttons Ctrl; S.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful ability of the beholder of & kphotoalbum; it is used in full-screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the entire place on the screen. simply use the input button to switch back into full-screen mode and back.</seg>

<seg id="1001">With the point button, you can reset your zoom, so that the image is not displayed zoomed. with the Equal speaker sets the zoom, so that every pixel corresponds to the screen of a pixel of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only Zoomoperations will work with videos that in and out with the plus and the key.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the turnkey functions from the context menu, you can spin the image. this does not work with videos. you can make comments to the current picture with the menu item, from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you consider images it can happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten on the picture. at the moment you can preview the image and open configuration dialog in the image to indicate that name. however, you will just prefer to highlight the picture and consider additional pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you would like to send a printer to a printer to get the pictures on paper. to see what photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad while watching one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above gives you the viewer the opportunity to view images with characteristics while you look at them. characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can put a characteristic that you press the corresponding letters. in view a picture in which the features A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have set features on your images, these are available to you in the browser. so you can use all the images you want to edit, print or whatever you have selected, so you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can display in the thumbnail. if you display categories in Dre thumbnail, then you can press features to the pictures by pressing the letters for the feature, after the picture was chosen. this can be seen here:</seg>

<seg id="1011">In a picture you can see an image on the measured album. to turn off the painting mode of & kphotoalbum; then click on the painting from the context menu. to finish the Malen, simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To work with & kpovmodeler; you need to control the application of the program & Povray; but the documentation for & Povray; should you absolutely read and understand.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree, you can select single objects. then their properties in the object properties are displayed and the object in the wire modell- views are shown in yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects simultaneously. but not the object of an already selected object, since all subproperties are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object in the object tree, select the position where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the toolbar or select a menu entry in the menu inserting.</seg>
<seg id="1016">Is there multiple possible positions, the following set-up menu appears, so that you can choose the correct position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">Either from the menu bar under edit or from the context menu of the right mouse button, you can remove selected objects from the scene before.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changed properties, click on to apply these changes. have invalid values, a message is displayed with a fault description. then you can click the input images and apply the changes with aborting.</seg>
<seg id="1019">If you enter the path to & Povray; user documentation in the furniture dialog, you can call the & Povray; reference to the object shown with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this property. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already contains the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">If you edit a texture or part of a texture, you can preview the peculiar view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Click on preview in the peculiar view and a small example of the scene is selected using the selected texture, even if you want a subordinated element (for example, a texture inside a texture map and not the entire texture map), you can cross locally.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screenshot shows the control points of the camera. you can drag and change these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is chosen, the control points and there will be a small cross in the wire model view. this cross marks the centre for scaling and spin as well as the position for deportations. you can change the shift through drag the mouse within the whole window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a visual-level of visibility. you can specify this value relative to the visibility level of the above-level object or as absolute value. objects are only displayed when they are selected or their visibility-stage is smaller or equal to the stage of the toolbar of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window-order as default. the object tree and view of object properties are displayed left and the four graphical views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the default window, or if you need a different order, you can set it any number. you can also save multiple shutters and simply switch between different orders.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window over or under a available view, drag the beginner to the top or bottom of a view. a rectangle shows then the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the beginner to the right or left side of a view. the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you would like to assign several views to each other, drag the beginner in the middle of another view. you can then switch between the views by clicking on the cartels of cartons on top of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window-order are sulking views: views that are not anchored in the main window. to view a view from the anchoring, drag the beginner to the desktop or click on the little ones left at the top left of the starter bar.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To view a view, click on the small cross in the thread bar. to avoid the closing, click on the small square between the arrow and the cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can insert additional views in the main window. in the menu View you will find entries for any type of views. new views are sounding, you can anchor them at any place.</seg>

<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene, you can renders them. & kpovmodeler; used & Povray; 3.1g for rendering, this program needs to be properly installed. as this manual was written, & Povray; 3.5 current. this version is currently supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0 does not support.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To renders the current scene, click on the icon renders in the toolbar or select the menu entry view.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A Render mode corresponds to the entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and the quality of renders. if you want to renders a scene in various image sizes and quality levels, you can insert as many roender modes, from a quick preview up to complete pictures of the highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the icon The Render settings in the toolbar or in view Render modes... select the following dialog:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each Render mode has a name. you can enter any name, useful is a name that lets you recognize the properties of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the map card size you can enter the width and height of the rounded image. if you want only one small area of the image, select the cross section and enter the image section to renders into the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In the Kombinational field you can select the properties that uses & Povray; for rendering it from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diffuser reflections. a detailed description of the Render's properties can be found in the user's manual to & Povray.</seg>
<seg id="1042">When a picture appears with only one ray per pixel, there may be different mistakes. these images often have a moirè-pattern or stuffed effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not shown if they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is called Aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the influence of these errors. generally, pictures with this property look better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you turn anti-aliasing, calculated and connects & Povray; more than a ray per pixel. this technique is called great sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super-sampling is adapted to the adjacent pixel. the second method is adaptive; recursively, because every pixel is repeatedly redistributed and adaptive because the reflex sticker depends on the calculated colour values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">When you choose the first method, POV-Ray pursuits a ray of pixels. if the difference between color values to the adjacent pixel are processed, a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated, at a depth of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -B 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 beams per pixel. if the difference between the color values indicated the pre-given threshold, then the pixel is divided in 4 subpixels that can be pursued individually and tested on further subdivision. the maximum depth of the recursion can be set with the depth.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is that the production of smoke for the beam process called Jittering. if you turn Jittering, changed & Povray; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for quality of Renderns is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental property of & Povray; the diffuse light reflexion calculates. it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map card, you can adjust if the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent when the associated rays have not made object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for viewing the & Povray. if & Povray; unexpectedly, you can find the reason here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray; choose the menu entry file Imported... and select a file in the dialog window.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supports & kpovmodeler; still not the complete commands from & Povray; when exporting error messages or warnings, a dialog box displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not support source code in & kpovmodeler; import this source code between the two special comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawend.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object tree into the editor to export the source code for & Povray. this adds the source code of the object into the opened text file in the editor. to import objects into the scene, simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copying and inserting in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can insert source code for & Povray; likewise.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler; a scene renders. usually this is Povray or x-Povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on help in the peculiar view, opens & kpovmodeler, the & Povray; user documentation displayed for the displayed object. provide the path to your documentation and the version. supported the versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (for example altimeter) in the paths to the & Povray; libraries. if you refer to files that are not in the folder of the scene, you also need to enter the path to these files here. if a file is used in different paths of the library, the first found file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for the wire models. the second color is used for viewing the selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the control points. the second color will be used for viewing the selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type labels.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the item-catch the points on the grid in the context menu of the wire model views. here you can adjust the grid separately for deportations, scaling and rotations.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values indicate a more accurate wire model and thus a better sewing for the objects shown, but require more time to renders. for some objects such as the ball, you can adjust the detailed level of the details for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you cross the High Detailed view for extended projection screens, all the Drahtmodel's views are further divided when the camera uses an extended projection. extended projections are all projections with exceptions to the perspective and the vertical projections. this property gives a better approach to projections, but requires more time to renders.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you show wall is a wall behind the objects, a wall is shown behind the objects. the wall is shown in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you show floor, a floor is raged below the objects. the floor is shown in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">When you cross sharpening plate, the non-recursive antialiasing method is used for rendering of scenes. the values for depth and swelling can be set. more exact details of the parameters can be found in the section Render modes.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can change existing window regulations or create new window regulations. in the window-regulations, you can create and store window regulations.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The Combinational field standard window: displays all existing shutters. & kpovmodeler; used the selected window arrangement when starting the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of existing shutters shows all existing shutters. a new arrangement allows you to create and delete a selected order using the button Remove button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Any window-order is identified by the name. the name must be clear and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list under the name displays all views of the chosen window arrangement. new views can be deleted using the button Remove button and remove selected views with the button Remove button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with New column, you create a new column on the right side of the existing window, with unfolded map, you get the window under the existing window, using map card, you will receive a map card screen, together with the previous view and woven, the view is not in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you have just installed & Povray; and now you want to start with no more precise knowledge of the two programs. if you follow all steps in this tutorial, you should create the ultimate but easy scene, under beginners very popular: one sphere on one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should consider the following warnings carefully before you complain that you will get as a result of just a black screen. if you use a 3D program to the first time, you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do not set a camera, no rules can be applied to renders as a result you get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you do not insert light sources, your whole scene is in the dark and you just get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have everything error-free, you will see at the first start of & kpovmodeler, following pre-presented shutters:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to know the menus and existing symbols of the toolbar. read the documentation so you can get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will often use these menus and symbols now, so you should remember the menus and symbols and also their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, you must first remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select the menu entry. so you have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene that you generate. especially notice that in the fourth wire-model view (right down). this is the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera. this shows you the result of Renderns of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. if they click on it, you will find the content of the View properties which can be found in the various parameters of the camera. in the user documentation to & Povray; find out more details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Just change the basic settings of the camera, this is later manuals, but note that the camera in view control points can change with which you can change the target point of the camera. simply click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired location.</seg>
<seg id="1088">When using the button or press the input button, the wire-model views and the object tree will immediately change according to these settings. as a result, they see the scene from the point of view of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the ground for the scene. you might add a quader (inserting body quader) and the size on x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a concrete method to solve this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; actually offers a simpler possibility. you can use an infinite plane as floor:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the level in the object tree, change the name and then press the button or paste the input button. in the object tree, the new name will immediately appear.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire-model view now shows the plain, even though at the moment only a limited endental level. if you want the scene, the layer extends up to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">When you look at the object tree exactly, you will notice that you click on the icon + in front of the object. in this case you will find the different parameters for each new object: scaling, rotation and shift. select one of these options, change the possible settings in the view of the object Properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should move the ground to exercise a unit under the horizontal line so you can get to know some of these parameters. select shifting and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">Just choose the ground to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but choose something in the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases a dialog box opens in which you can select how the object is inserted. you can change the name in the property view (name = floor pigment), with a click on the button preview you can see how the pigment now looks.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of pigments only shows a matt black material because you can still enter settings for the pigment. therefore, remember that you can check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview. now, there are many possibilities now, but do not take the easiest.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you're unable to preview any color on the pader and ball, click on the button to apply it and then click the Preview button.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now correctly set. if you want to draw your image now with a click on the icon, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, this is not the color you have expected. here are still other settings necessary. in the Object tree you need to enter two new attributes. then edit this entry twice (you can also do this more frequently, but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">Choose in the object tree every time and change the colors in the view of the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">You should already be able to run this step as you should have understood the basic working method of & kpovmodeler; you should have understood the ball just as simple as the ground:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object properties, you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: on 1 (do not forget the input paste or the button), so that the ball has pushed into contact with the ground. otherwise, the ball will float above the ground, since you have moved the ground to have a unit downwards.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, the rendering is now a strange outcome: how previously to see, the ball surface appears like a matt black material. continue in the following step a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have chosen the ball, you can assign it to a material now. as already in the ground, you enter the ball a pigment as color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select your object and change the name for example in sphere pigment. click Ball pigment, select then catarable and make the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can reach more interesting effects if you take the time, stop some finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as in the following screen pictures and click to apply or press Enter.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings shine effect and reflection result in partly good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed finishes, even if metallic: not yet chosen:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of what opportunities you & kpovmodeler offers. hopefully you've already learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytrayearning is a Render method to create a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene or a model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">When you use a scene raytracen, the rendering of the hypothetical blazes out from the perspective of the beholder (i.e. from the camera, which calculates the scenes) by each pixel in the scene and how atmospheric effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects will impact such as fog. thus, the scene pixels has been processed for pixels.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you will see nothing without a camera, the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene. without a light source you also see nothing, the picture is simply black. obviously, every scene, which is to be scourged, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Open a file. in default file dialog you can select a file which you have previously created with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open a new model or create, the file is inserted in this submenu and replaced the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model, it is stored under the same name. it is a new file, you must enter a name and disk space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Displays the scene in the last saved version. all changes since the last storage are rejected.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu entry can only be chosen if you do not have stored changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeated the last reversed command. this menu entry can only be chosen if you have used any feedback.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Saves the current window-order and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new order or write an existing order.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you will find options for setting & kpovmodeler;, here you can change the look, the keyboard shortcut and the standard behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog to change the keyboard shortcut. you can change or add new commands for & kpovmodeler with this option.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog to set up the toolbar. you can add and remove a dialog with this option tool icons for & kpovmodeler.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A dump map is a possibility of changing screw surfaces without having to model any bump on the surface individually and without changing the geometric shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is customary to use the same file for a dump map as well as for a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic body are simple geometric shapes which you can use as a building blocks: very complex 3D models are made of dozens or even hundreds of this basic body. these models are then further processed to give them a realistic appearance.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixels base, by applying an image file as color card.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuickshow; is a comfortable image storage and browser browser. the application has a file browser which allows you to select images to display.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can either be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & kuickshow; is very simple. the file browser lists files that you can view with clicking the & LMBn; or the key Return.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can adjust if each image is to be displayed in a separate window, or if all images always should use the same window.</seg>
<seg id="1133">If you are looking for a specific file, simply type the first signs of the file name in the browser window. then a small input field is found in the right bottom corner. if a suitable file name was found, the file is highlighted. you can leave the input field by pressing Return or & Esc.</seg>
<seg id="1134">In dialogue Inclusion - & kuickshow; there are five cards cards. in three of them, General and editing and slideshow, you can set the working method of & kuickshow; set in the two other, short commands for the scoreboard and short command for the browser, you can set the keyboard shortcut for the respective window.</seg>
<seg id="1135">If this is selected, the images will be opened in full-screen mode. if the image is not big enough to fill the screen, the rest of the display space filled with the background color that you can set further down. default is not a full-screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Is this point activated, loads & kuickshow; already the next picture in the folder, while you still watch the current picture. this reduces the delay if you choose the next picture and is particularly suitable for a slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="1137">With this option saves & kuickshow; at the closing the name of the last opened folder. at the next start opens & kuickshow; this folder in the browser window.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Click on the colored beams to select a background color. this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode. if in the window mode the window is bigger than the picture, the background is filled with the selected color.</seg>
<seg id="1139">You can set up & kuickshow; so set up that only some of the file types can be displayed, which also can represent the program.</seg>
<seg id="1140">With this option for large images the scoreboard can be enlarged on the full screen. this option is switched on default.</seg>
<seg id="1141">Determine if the slideshow is to start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image.</seg>
<seg id="1142">The time span between the image change in a slideshow. to change the value, you can enter a new value into the input field or use the sliders or the small arrows right next to the input field. the default is 3 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="1143">The number of repetitions is set to 0, the slideshow is repeated until it is canceled by the user. to change the value, you can enter a new value into the input field or use the sliders or the small arrows right next to the input field. the default is 1.</seg>
<seg id="1144">Change the keyboard shortcut for the different modes of cards from & kuickshow; in cartcards short commands for the scoreboard and short-command for the browser.</seg>

<seg id="1183">The DCOP-Interface from Amarook has many general functions, which mostly can also be found in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the DCOP-functions of collection, context browser, player, playlist, playlists, playlists and scripts. an example will look for the DCOP-function break & eg; to look like this:</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarook supports the command line options of Qt and & KDE;. additionally, Amarook has some own commands options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user a feedback if the script should not be executed due to a lack of dependence. please check in your script if all the required modules are available and use kdialog so that the user note, why a script does not run.</seg>

<seg id="1187">In the folder script / templates you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use them as a basis for your own scripts, or simply add them to the required functions. you will quickly determine that writing scripts is relatively simple.</seg>
<seg id="1188">With the help of DCOP you can exchange your scripts with Amarook and Amarook. the easiest way is to use the command dcop; which should be included in each KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages allow the outputs of external programs and commands. it is usually used the Exec function. in this way, dcop &gt; relatively easy to be called. here is an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& Amarok; sends alerts to all running scripts. for this reason, script should constantly monitor their standard output and respond accordingly to events. of course, a script should ignore the events even if there is no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure the script to display the furniture dialog. to save the storing and loading of the furniture you must take care of any script. if a script is started, Amarok sets the workfolder on the folder where all data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">Trackchange signaled that a new piece is played. the script could now ask for example; with DCOP-functions further information about the new piece queries (for example the metadata or the piece).</seg>
<seg id="1193">VolumeChange newVolume signals a change of volume. the new volume is an integer range between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Customization: submenu titles are clicked on the path to selected files of the playlist if a user-defined menu entry is clicked on. to add an entry to the menu you can use dcop AmaroeItem (submenu) to remove dcop AmaroScript-veCustomMenuItem (submenu).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & Amarook; it stops, or when the user stops a script, sends & Amarook, the signal SIGTERM sends to the script. this signal should be processed to do e. g. for storing data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script Administration can also install script packages that can be downloaded from a web server. such packages are basically normal Tar-archives (.tar), which optionally available with bzip2 (.bz2), so that the user can detect the archive clearly as Amarook script package.</seg>

<seg id="1243">Amarook requires only the package Kdelibs and otherwise no other KDE packages. you need to install Kdelibs (including the programs contained therein, as & Amarook; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts). we have written a small guide on how to compile Kdelibs minimal.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some features such as the OSD continue that your window manager will function the relevant standards of freedesktop.org. we try to support Amarobox on all platforms, so we will use Kdelibs and Qt because these are ready for an excellent development environment.</seg>

<seg id="1246">Mostly it is that Taglib crashes when reading the meta-information from this file. please report this error to the seminar developers under bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database then try SQLite. support for this in & Amarook; is a little more mature.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure that all of & Amarook have been compiled with the same compiler version. if e.g. & Amarook have been compiled with GCC 3.4, TagLib but with GCC 3.3.x, then this leads to overthrow the meta-information.</seg>

<seg id="1455">This is a convenient method, recently opened projects again. the associated submenu contains a list of these projects. one click on an entry opens the project.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Saves the current project. if the project was already saved, the previously created file will be overwritten, otherwise it is asked for a new file name.</seg>
<seg id="1457">Saves the current project under a new file name. KDE's dialog save is displayed, with which you can choose folder and filename to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="1458">Saves all opened projects. this is the same as if you would like to save file for every single project.</seg>
<seg id="1459">Includes the current project. if a project changes and has not been saved, asks & K3b; by what shall happen. you can then choose between saving and changes. besides, you can cancel the closing and keep the project open so.</seg>

<seg id="1462">When you access this entry, you can select the same effect as when you enter the files directly from the top view into the project view. if the current project is a CD-CD, the files added to the basic folders on the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1463">Opens the dialog "Burn" for the current project. this dialog is basically the same as the Properties dialog of the project. the only difference is the additional button burning, the & K3b; to burning the medium. the burning dialog can only be opened if the project has already been data.</seg>
<seg id="1464">Opens the properties dialog for the current project. here you can make many project-related settings. each project type has different possible settings, most of which are described above the What is that? help (accessible via the right mouse button).</seg>
<seg id="1465">This entry will only appear with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project. it's useful when you choose files to the current project. this is useful when you are not using files for a multi-format CD. it is thought for you rather than help, so that you can already see the files and folders on the media.</seg>
<seg id="1466">This entry only appears with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project. this function led & K3b; to remove files from the current project. all other files remain in the project. this function does not remove files from the medium, it blends only the previously imported files.</seg>
<seg id="1467">Opens the CD-Copy dialog. alternatively, you can also create a copy of a CD on a different medium. alternatively, you can also just create an image of a CD which will then be able to burn then later. also, there is also the possibility of cloning instead of normal copying. you should also prefer clones if you want to copy CDs with broken sectors or video CDs.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Opens the DVD Copy dialog. alternatively, you can also create a DVD-copying DVD on a different medium. alternatively, you can also only create an image of a DVD with the help of the copying dialogue will not be supported, therefore the target medium must be large enough to record the entire (video) data of the source media in the original form.</seg>

<seg id="1477">Switches the folder view or off. the folder view contains an overview of your folder and CD / DVD drives. if the table view is activated, their content is displayed in the table view. CD / DVD drives have also a context menu with features such as media info, lock and dislock of the disk or throwing the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1478">Switches the table view or out. the table view allows to select and drag files into the projective view. the table view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs, provided a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view.</seg>
<seg id="1479">The headline appears in the projecar view or out. the head bar is a narrower area, which contains only visible when the projector has no real function, it looks only pretty and separates the projectview clearly from the remaining views.</seg>

<seg id="1481">This starts the K3b; interior supervisor. thus, the correct permissions needed to burn CDs and DVDs. for this you need system administrator rights, therefore you must enter the password for the system administrator at the start of the wizard.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Opens the settings of & K3b; here general programme can be made. nearly all functions of & K3b; should work on Anhieb. this dialog is intended for personalize and designed for the fine tuning of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& K3b; is how many other & KDE; applications are also equipped with a & DCOP; interface. with the help of this interface, parts of functionality may be controlled via a shell script.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP; functions to use, you can either use the command line program dcop, or the slightly more comfortable program Kdcop. both programs are identical in the functionality of Kdcop. therefore, your taste and the type of your task is decisive in which the condener programs you give.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter we assume that you can use the command line program dcop. to make use of the & DCOP; you need to make sure that & K3b; started. then enter something like the following on the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">In addition to the general & DCOP; functions that are all & KDE; program measured, supported & K3b; mainly two more parts which are described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP-Interface of & K3b; features functions such as copyCD, formatDVD and other functions for generating new projects.</seg>

<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method you can create a DCOP-reference to the newly created project: # K3b --auditd and then a reference to the project received by # dcop K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b.</seg>

<seg id="1492">This makes it possible to fill up a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, several folders and then insert files into the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT ecop / foo dcop / somefile.txt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& kaudiocreator; is an audio CD; -read for & KDE;. with it you can easily read audio CD; s read and saved in MP3- or OGG files. other formats are possible, depending on the encoder installed on the machine.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudiocreator; is the user interface of cdparanoia (for reading from & CD; data in WAV files on hard disk) and by many Kodiers who need to encoding these WAV files (compressed air compression). further coders can be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, the title of the & CD are recorded; stored and stored in WAV files on the machine (lossy-free and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step these WAV files (usually one per titles) compressed into the MP3- or OGG format or in other formats such as the lossfree FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD; will be used by & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, this must be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step, lame (for MP3), oggvorup (for OGG) or other coders already exist, it is therefore most likely not necessary for any Linux distributions, so it is very likely not necessary for any Linux distributions that are needed. however, only the encoding packages are needed. if for example Flash C is not used, its installation is also not required.</seg>

<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, encoding and compressing rates and helps you choose the right codile.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to go lost, a lossfree audio format is required. besides FLAC, there are also other such as' shorten 'or' monkey 'that may possibly be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can reproduce these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats you lose information through data compressed according to their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above this bitrate, the differences are less important since both Kodiers produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'not so 'free, lame will nevertheless be supplied free with most distributions, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high to very high clay quality (with high bitrates) but compared to OGG slightly deeper quality in low bitrates.</seg>

<seg id="1518">MP3 - when music should also be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD player, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard drive) or special car-stereo. today - beginning 2009 - support these devices mostly only the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters for audio quality and the resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for further parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">"" "" "" "--preset medium" = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music. "" "</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "" "" "--preset standard '= this setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most of the tunes, and has quite high quality. good enough for HiFi stereo system with high quality." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme' = 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compressive rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for HiFi stereo with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -B 256' = 256 kbps CBR, compression rate approximately 5.5. needs always 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for HiFi stereo system with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h' = 128 kbps CBR joint stereo, compression rate about 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good genug for music of young people, portable devices and autoclereofacilities. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting is exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want to have the absolutely highest quality without regard to file size, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information provided manually or through the program automatically from the freeDB via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can pass / used with & kaudiocreator; and the encoding program to create the folder and file name as well as the properties of music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with codification programs, there is often a combination of programs for the codification and these parameters here. the manual or the help with the coders explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">E.g. to add the & CD; title to the keywords (English: tag) if MP3s are coded with lame, the switches must be added by lame and the title parameters of & kaudiocreator; the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button-drawing in assistant):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freeDB is: a free database where people can download the audio CDs to enter the information instead of yourself into the computer. it is to note that here only from text is said: & CD; titles, artist, names of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (anm of the Ueberries) is not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent that you may cause any damage from the & CD; and there is also the information without the & CD; more or less valuable, so may neither the artist nor the music can cause damage. all information can occur in any bumblebee by a & CD; shop, physical or virtuoso.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & audiocreator; is actively a cross-cross (send an address). in this type of configuration, it appears, the e-mail address is not used when retrieving the data from the server (This may only know the programmer who has checked the code).</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudiocreator; used to use FreeDB, the geographically should be used on the next lying mirror server. this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between machines.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of mirrors for the online retrieval of & CD; information while reading a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually month) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which reading program is used to store pieces from the & CD; save in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumors that cdparanoia is used; who wants to know more exactly, search in source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; see that the cdparanoia package has to be installed first at first if this has not yet happened.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To save the full WAV files the encoding and the desired file format may be chosen. at first opening there are pre-defined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a lossfree compression for audio data) on the tab for insertion of the encoding. other Kodiers can be added on this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The codile package must be installed from the respective Linux distribution before the encoding. this is necessary for predefined coaster. more information about codiers are in the chapter Welcher Kodiers.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a codile you can get more information about his switches through the input of a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console).</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the setup of the device drawing of the & CD; / DVD drives on it and whether both cdparanoia and the audio encoding of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, flac & etc;). try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal. that could give a hint about what is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you do not want to read a copy-protected audio CD; check out the envelope of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you use other settings, this can give tips on how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Did you read the complete manual, but are somehow still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, read everything and our first & CD. we will use lame '--preset extreme' use MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3v1 keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">It must be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be found as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can be found for example using a search engine, since it is considered not completely free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can naturally always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd / cd / cd / cd / cd / cd / cd / cd / cd / cd (eg; by trying to copy it with the conqueror).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic set of & kaudiocreator; something that probably is done once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes how to read a & CD; what needs to be repeated for each edition & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the encoded coders for the compression of music (lame) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). as we are lazy, we share the program to use the freeDB to download the & CD; data from the Internet to download.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will most likely not be able to read any of a & CD if the matching settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device-drawing is transferred to the read-out program to read the & CD; data / pieces can be read.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Frequently / dev / cdrom a symbolic link to the actual device-drawing of your drive. if this does not work or if more than a & CD; / DVD Drive can be accessed, so a look at the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device designations for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The map card General settings. here gibts do not have much to do. here an additional transformation may be defined. in our example everything will be as belated / typed as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only when uncomplete information can be retrieved, so that you will be informed when indications are missing from keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1555">The map card CD; settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortable and allow the & CD; data automatically download the Internet from a freeDB calculator.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the calculator must be connected to the Internet while reading the & CD, so that it can access the freeDB server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection field is easier, becomes a & CD; entry found, begins immediately the reading of the & CD; which is dissatisfied with the database name and the default directory name / filename or filename, they can easily be altered using the directory entry and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & KDE; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, it is further to note: if you want to manually enter the selection fields and freeDB will not be used. however, this over 620 MB will not be used. however, you can use the database previously. however, this is worth 620 MB to use, the two choices must be selected, at least the first. the mode is set up on the following map card.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is for us freeDB. these are settings for data inquiry, for retrieving the & CD; information from the freeDB server via the Internet. how do the system know which data will be given to the CD? read the section about freeDB. put everything as it pictured in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we have not downloaded the database, we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB-Server: please go to the page freedb.org and look for a mirror server in your area. on this way the load is distributed among the machines. however, this setting will work as first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both function as equivalent to the server, there are many firewalls the protocol 880 default, maybe more luck with the protocol 80, since the & HTTP; protocol is usually open to surf the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example we do not want to submit a & CD; data to the freeDB server should deactivate the first bond field.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Just take the settings of the screen shot. (make sure that the folder / tmp exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number at the same pieces: sorry, there is a reason why more than one at the same time with just an existing drive? parallelRead and encoding? the author doesn't know, therefore simply try ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD: after reading the last piece: follow this to cast this to the & CD; at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">User-defined folder for temporary files: if you are going to cross the path / folder in which the WAV files can be stored. this can not be useful if only space on another drive is created. do not forget the folder in the private folder. forget that folder if you want to make something with the WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Everything you enter as it is on the screen shot. the command is a bit long, under circumstances something must be shaken to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as previously mentioned, this is an adjustment for very good audio quality, even for very good HiFi stereo. the resulting bitrate is average about 224 to 256 kpbs. the achieved compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for the limitation of the production of tags at version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags can also be deleted. Kid3 is an excellent 'ID3' Tagger for & KDE; in the case of later change the tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the complete path) and the output file (including the complete path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Put the rest as in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside of this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneously to codifying WAV files: with a dual core or quadcore or even a multi-processor machine, you can encoding more than a WAV file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">This is because we have just finished the basic setup of & kaudiocreator; this configuration is used as standard for each read of a & CD; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music, you will never need to change them again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section describes how the process of reading the & CD. we will create MP3 files. the folder structure, the way the music is organized on the hard drive, as we are comfortable and the & CD; data from the freeDB would like to be described in this section, it must be repeated for each edition & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1575">As we use a & CD, which is not yet included in freeDB, see the Screen photos a little different from the data for a & CD; therefore, you will learn the & CD; data manually to enter instead of sending it from the internet. comments will refer to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Try not to find the & CD; this example will be found. it is a 'special' issue of the author of this handbook.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not yet done so now the & CD must be defined in the drive, which was defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and its length should be listed in the window, as in the screenshot. this only if the & CD; as an audio CD; be identified and can be read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this does not happen then you are looking for questions and answers following the help or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD was done successfully from the freeDB, all titles of the pieces are already completed and the name of the artist and album are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than an entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; the key for your & CD; there will be a window appears, and you can select the database entry containing your opinion best to your & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you do not have the cross-box for automatic query of freeDB (on the page & CD; settings in dialog for settings), you can also manually trigger this by choosing the first button in the toolbar. if you do not have local database, you need the connection to the Internet.</seg>

<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screen photo. the title of the piece in the first row of the 'actuator title', the rest of the data in the input field 'album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist must no longer be entered in the input field 'actueller title' unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower commentary box can be used for the individual comments inidialyell per piece, the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply together for all the pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after successful retrieval of data from the freeDB is not empty, but it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor, so that you can not only start with the artist and album name (e.g. whether all words with big letters begin or not...) but also to check if there are any unwanted remarks.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example we use ID3v1 tags. this limit the length of fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the comment range. if you use ID3v2 tags, you have set up unlimited field-length, at least on what & kaudiocreator; maximum permits. this option is set on the tab button in the Settings tab.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag of the generated files later at any time with the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all encoders or file formats. see in the help of the encoding to obtain more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry that is obvious with the style of the prefix CD. in this example this is not important as we don't transmit the & CD. for further information go to the website of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example are to be found under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK' come back to the main window. click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD editor will be released again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data that we have recorded for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece. the title of the piece is definitely the case and other information you wish.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window doesn't appear if you have downloaded the data from the freeDB. it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the toolbar. note that the artist and the album are displayed above the piece-list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there's a check-sign in front of each line of a piece. only the titles that are marked are selected. a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece or out. make sure that all pieces select the piece or select the button all pieces select at the bottom of the screen to pick all the pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">Was started by clicking on the button to read the reading process, this window appears to confirm confirmation. click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what is happening.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the tab for switching on the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, directly under the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to control the orders. the first piece is currently read on the hard disk. the status of the program is displayed in the lower lower part of the window in the status bar.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message can be seen if you are trying to work with a codile that you have not yet installed. pieces which were not successfully coded with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder to the tmp file and the target folder are not what we have entered here in the example. have you checked if you have a write access to the folder for temporary files and target folders?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of the reading of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The job 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: order 4 is the coding of piece 1 into the format MP3. so take reading and encoding parallel. take note of the status message in the lower part of the window, it's now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the programmer has found no configuration settings to suppress this behavior. the only thing can be configurable, the number of parallel processes for reading and encoding. on high-performance machines the result is unclear. the computer used with an AMD64 appears to have no problem with simultaneous reading and encoding (from however, two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read, while another piece is coded and a third order is coded into the queue of the Kodifier. after the last piece is coded, a small window with a message appears for a short time in the upper left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kaudiocreator; you need & KDE; 3.x. or 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to generate compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG, you need the codification of your choice.</seg>
<seg id="1608">& kaudiocreator; is now available within the & KDE; CVS is as part of the kmoto media package. however, most distributions have already included a pre-compiled package, da & kaudiocreator; a part of an important & KDE bundle. if you read this, you probably have already done it...</seg>
<seg id="1609">This section is directed to individuals that compile from source files, and not for users who use a pre-compiled package of their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="1610">If you are searching for help as the program can be adapted to your needs, the following is correct for you:</seg>
<seg id="1611">A program that calls many different other programs, has many variations of settings. best you can read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings. it displays screen pictures of the different cards of settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example.</seg>
<seg id="1612">Hello, still alive? even if only the help menu was clicked after the first time of the program, without any clue as it is to go on from this sort of empty screen (especially if at the time of the program starts no audio CD; in the drive), or from the unusually short menu?</seg>
<seg id="1613">What is it? who reads this has probably already started the program. it should somehow look like this:</seg>
<seg id="1614">A bad example: unfortunately no e-mail. the author can not maintain this manual. it is intended as the first version for a manual to & kaudiocreator; whoever wants to do something or change it. at least just after contacting the author. and if you read this, he did leave this section and therefore agree with this suggestion.</seg>
<seg id="1615">Strange when we succeeded is the source file from the & KDE; SVN, then you don't need these informatics but...</seg>
<seg id="1616">& kmid; is the MIDI- and Karaoke gamer from & KDE; in addition to others he did not have a real-time graphic and karaoke-real-record highlighting of texts also some attributes, the other & UNIX; -MIDI players do not have.</seg>
<seg id="1617">& kmid; runs under & Linux; and FreeBSD. it builds on the OSS system, so it should work on all systems with OSS - and & KDE; support also supports the & Linux; Ultrasynx project drivers, which is required for CIS cards. ALSA is included as soon as it supports a sequence.</seg>
<seg id="1618">& kmid; displays the lyrics text on the screen with changing color, so it is easy to follow the piece.</seg>

<seg id="1622">Seat support. if you end & KDE; during the playing of a song end, Kmid will start again with the same song again.</seg>
<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI synthesizer, Awe, FM and CIS cards (for the latter you need the LUP Driver and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can open air... from the menu file. it appears the usual file dialog with which help you select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also drop a file from one & conqueror; window into the & kmid; window will drop. this also works with multiple songs simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and hit the button playing in the toolbar, select the entry off from the menu item or bets the spacebar.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece automatically starts as soon as you drag it to the & kmid; you will be added to a collection and then played in each other.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">Once & kmid; a piece plays, you can jump in any place by using the middle mouse button and drive with the controller.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that song will be played too fast or too slow, you can click on the arrows left and right of the tempodisplay and so change the playback speed. to get the original speed, double click on the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The spacebar has two tasks: when a piece is played, a pressure on the button or the selecting the menu entry into the menu piece, i.e. the playback. if you play the spacebar while no piece is played, starts & kmid; the playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be saved on two types in a piece of music. some pieces use text allowance, others use Liedtexternal, and again others. some pieces have no text: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid; you can set out which events are to be presented and even better: the event styp is automatically chosen to activate a song so you don't have to adjust the automatic text text. you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other type.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set a particle type set, select from the menu settings the entries text or property events. the same function also have the keys 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files which summarize you. these are playable in this section as you can use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. you will find this menu collection under the point Organize.... Click there to New and enter the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection. this collection will include the same songs as the original one.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can set the threads in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">In the temporary collection all the songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When you leave the application, this collection will not be stored. concerns you when you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it must add a song in the collector manager. there, you can add a song with the button adding. it appears in turn the file dialog with which help you select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on setting automatic adding to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic adding is enabled for collection, a piece of opening (using file opening or drag & drop) automatically added to the active collection.</seg>
<seg id="1643">When Automatically add to the collection is not activated, when opening a piece the temporary collection is activated and emptied. this collection will then be added to the further open pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played. if you select the row according to the menu item menu, the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">When you add songs or select songs or select random order in the menu, the order will be redefined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collector manager, or use the selection list via the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To jump on a song, select the button next song, the entry next song from the menu item or push the left arrow to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">In order to jump back a song, select the button previous piece, the item previous piece from the menu item or push the left arrow to the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection and click on the button Delete.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection can not be deleted. however, this does not play a role as it is saved at the abandonment of & kmid; not saved.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizer that are not General-MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI map is translated general-MIDI events in events that synthesizer the synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map, which transforms all events of the type Change patch to Bright Piano in events of the Type D patch to Trumpet and thus always sound a trumpet if originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you only have a sound card, you don't need any MIDI map, because all sound cards are GM -compatible (incl. Awe - and CIS cards, FM radio devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">Unfortunately, there is no programs to create MIDI-maps. you need to edit the appropriate file from hand (with your favourite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-map is a text file that stores all required realizations for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear once, except the KEYMAP section, which may appear as often as desired. for this is, however, that each occurrence has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define KEYMAP "A further Keymap"... END Define CHANNELMAP... END Options... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that Define is needed to indicate that a section begins (except for Options) and END that the end of a paragraph is achieved.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as an e-mail so I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support can be used for devices that are not General-MIDI-compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section the patches of General MIDI on your specific keyboard is shown. the general use looks as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the Equal sign is ignored. it is assumed that GM -patches are written in the correct order (from 0 to 127), you may not change the order and also leave no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllkeysTo M is needed to put all notes on the sound with the number M. if your keyboard, for example does not support a gun kiss (GM-patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with clay 60), which is similar to a gun shot. do you wear the following in the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So when a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with Patch 127 (tissue), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the tone 60, irrespective of which sound in the MIDI file is.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here with the term drum patch of the patch is meant to be a different percussioning instrument (drum, pelvis, Maracas & etc;) and not the one where the tone also means the tone-height of the ever same drum (like some keyboards).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is needed to indicate how sounds are shown on a certain channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the order of lines is very important, as their presence. you need to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several keywords for each channel and each instrument. you just have to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keynote will be used primarily to form tones on the Perl channel. look at the supplied keynote as an example.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to form some channels on others. if you want to change the first and second channel, you can easily make this in CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are useful for keyboards which have the percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI to Channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">Midi devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, according to the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel, which is pictured on the channel. if you use the Keymap option, the keymap must be defined in the file name. if you are using the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored that will change the patch on this channel. in this case, the patch will then always be used patch.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Forcepatch option can be useful for example to always use the perl-patch on the Perl-channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchbenderRatio will be in which relationship Pitch-bender events will be multiplied. if a MIDI file sends a pitch-list with the value n, this is used with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then only passed. the value 4096 is used, so that in the map file does not stand decimal combinations).</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM gives that a keyboard, which is a pitch-bender event with the value 4096 to play a sound higher. unfortunately, however, try to play some keyboards up to one octave higher. to try the correct value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, simply open the dialog MIDI settings. you will find them in the menu under Settings, point MIDI settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The canalview is a window with a whole series of clvials (one for each MIDI channel). on these pivials you see which tones are straight.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel. for each channel there is a selection list where you can choose an instrument, the button no longer green but red, to indicate that no longer is used the original instrument.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The kanalview has (until now) two different views to indicate the played tones. view in the menu settings below the Point channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The speed LCD displays the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the pace of a song. so if you find e.g., a song is too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the pace, use the arrows left and right of the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a piece of music has to be played. it contains the notes, the rhythm, the speed, & etc. it can result in the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results, just as two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Good, I can compel anybody, & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression mode) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, the speed & etc. you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) of & kmid; that happens because & kmid; without Awe support has been compiled. to remove the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example of kmid; 's)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't want to add all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Disagrees to support & kmid; Drag & Drop. open the folder you want to add in & Konqueror; select all the files and drag them to the & kmid; -window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">You absolutely activate the setting of automatic adding to the collection. otherwise the files are added to a temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can watch the arrow key on the left of the Tempo- LCD control to slow the playback. to restore the standard tempo you can double click on the LCD double.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have a & Konqueror; -window with my MIDI folder and & kmid; on this desktop (if I play a karaoke file) or attached (if I want to cancel a karaoke file) or I want to cancel a file, just switch to the & Conqueror; window switch and the desired file to the window of & kmid; drag.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you just want to listen to a file without adding a file, turn off the setting of automatic adding to the collection, and the new; file is added to temporary collection. opening files</seg>
<seg id="1692">Suppose that, you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.A.D. First you just want to cancel the first file. so, set off automatic adding to the collection and open A.mid. its temporary collection then contains exactly this a MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then you choose to play also B.mid and C.mid to play and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people have sent me MIDI files or postcards. congratulations to all the many thanks! if I hear these songs or view the postcard, animates me to program on & kmid; to program.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; I was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; in the moment I am written in the third year, so I'm not much free time for my hobbies, but I try to take a bit of time for my hobbies, but I try to collect myself a bit of time. as hobbies I have programming, MIDI files, make music and prove propositions.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where to download MIDI / karaoke files if you have a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or even if you just want to make me happy, send me an email: larrosa @ kde.org or antlarr @ araciis.es</seg>

<seg id="1710">It is possible to adjust the favorite connections under the bookmarks menu, but these are individual entries. if you want to create a list of entries that are playable to each other, you should use the category of thumbs playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to receive an additional hierarchy. if you pop an entry, his group and all its sub-groups are copied to the current category and playback begins with the attached entry.</seg>

<seg id="1714">All changes will be lost if the job mode leave or another group will be selected without the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Due to the convenience of the author of & kmplayer, some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation at startup and responds can be disabled by the editing of ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and Change from [General Options] No Intro = 0 obiger option on '1'. if the option is not available, it can be easily inserted.</seg>

<seg id="1718">The animation at startup does not need to be short, it will automatically terminate through opening another source. this would be disruptive at the end-animation, the user can therefore end the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start-animation can be the ads of a favorite photos: & lt; s; yee = / / / home / Koos / mum.gif / mum.gif / mum.gif / mum.gif; / lt; / smiles; / lt; / smilted; / lt; / smilted; / lt; / smilted; / lt; / smilted; / s; / smilted; / s; / smilted; / s; / smilted; / s; / smilted; / s; / smilted; / s; / s; / lt; / s; / s; / s; / s; / s; / s; / s; / s; / s; / s; / s; / s; / s; / s; / s; / s; / s; / s; / s; / s) are supported by SMIL that are supported by & kmplayer;</seg>

<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the button 'console' in the toolbar of kmplayer. here is the output of mplayer visibly.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no rider for this playback device in the configuration dialog by & kmplayer; all must be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplaywc. here is an example like a 'flash' with the module swfdec-mozilla is played:</seg>

<seg id="1726">Thus getting a given backend for a particular MIME type (of course only if this was also determined), this must be done by manual change of the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplaywc. for example, phonon should reproduce all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& kmplayer; can play from TV maps, either using MPlayer or XVideo (this need kxvplayer). before TV can be used, the scanner is used from the configuration dialog, or the configuration file can be manually edited.</seg>

LaTeX commands.</seg>
<seg id="1761">All documents are normally divided into some elements. & latex; the subdivision of the document into the following elements (part is the most beautiful and subtraced the lowest element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">When viewing the document in the structure view, the individual elements can be changed and viewed by one click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="1763">In creating your own & latex; files can be very helpful in creating your own & latex; as soon as a DVI; file [framed file (engl. D e V ice I noses File)] was created, jumps & kile; by a click with the middle mouse button in the DVI; viewer for the corresponding line in the & latex; source code.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI; file contains a description of the formatted document and also other information such as font; or & latex;. there are many tools for viewing, conversion and printing of DVI; files for different systems and uprights.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using the edges are the elements of the DVI; file is clicked with the editor and once on an element in the DVI; file clicked on is the exact opposite of it. once upon a section in the & latex; source code was clicked, becomes the corresponding point in the DVI; observer scanned.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master's document: this function is used when working with multiple files. with a Master document the work is simplified with other emtex files. when using a project a project-wide master document can be set on project preferences.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Fast construction: the & latex; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed (if no error in the source code).</seg>
<seg id="1768">File annuation: in this mode, the DVI; file on the course of course, the DVI, and there is not a call of & ocular; according to the rapid construction.</seg>
<seg id="1769">When considering the editing toolbar. the selection fields were developed for fast insertion of common elements into the document. the first selection field is intended for quick shutdown of the document into parts, chapters, sections,... The verable & latex; statements for the subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The selection field more is available for example of articles such as keywords, fucking notes or references. the publishers are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: with this command a name for a section, an image or different element is created.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Cover: is used for reference to a fixed name (selection of a selection).</seg>
<seg id="1773">When using quotation, a selection list is displayed with literary entry. at & bibtex; files are appropriate editors necessary. the author has good experience with & kbbtex; and & kbib; and the & bibtex; files can be made by hand also in & kile; by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last drop field with the name of GrÃ ¼ e will be used for defining the font. it enables the font for the main text, the fox, etc. etc. there are the following fonts for disposal:</seg>
<seg id="1775">"" "" "" "when calling & kile, two choices are available: 1. the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document font and fixed settings. 2. the document can be written from scratch." ""</seg>
<seg id="1776">The brackets after the command\\ Documemony contain the settings for the command. the setting [12pt] sets the font. if the letterment is not specified at the beginning, this can also be done in text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the above source code was entered the & latex; source code has to be compiled. the easiest way to this is the use of the menu or the button of the button.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be stored before the compiling. & kile; for storage, the storage is automatically saved.</seg>
<seg id="1779">Conclusions the compiling of the document was missing, should be searched in the logging after the errors. when using quickset should be started. if this is not the case, the logging should be observed.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (English. environment) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document. for example, a report with the fonts have been created. the command\\ begin {environment},\\ HUGE and\\ end {environment}, then the course of lettering from the lettering can be found within the area.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The inspection will only be cautious only within the area (from\\ begin {environment} to\\ end {environment}). there is no description (number) for transport within an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many possibilities for enlightening the readability and usability of the document. for example, certain fonts, fat pressure, subsistence, submissions, etc. are added to either with the command\\, or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is for the course of course and is long as long until he is closed with a\\ end {emph} or another environment. a single word in a sentence can be represented with\\ emph {word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ rate: creates a quotation in the document. the quotation begins with\\ begin {rate} and ends with\\ end {rate}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background to write the source code with the & latex; pronunciation language, follows is now a step-by-step guide for creating a document in & kile;</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once the wizard was typed a bit of text, a few adjustments should be done for the better readability of the document. for this, a quotation, a few places in the fat and cursing pressure and a poem are to be seen in order to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document was viewed, using Editor-View or Ctrl E again (with the internal viewer). with an external viewer, its window must be closed.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI; file was created, the document can be printed or converted into a & PostScript file. simply try and Spaak.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is a long-term file format (engl. D e V ice I noses). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for readability of some drivers of the computer, there are many different types of the .dvi output like printers, & PostScript; / PDF converters or computer imaging.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For printing a & DVI; file are the same steps as for the creation of the document (see). at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - then the document can be printed by file prints (in the viewer) (if the printer is set properly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar button is the conversion of the DVI; file in other formats. as soon as the DVI; file from the & latex; source code was created, the conversion can be used by using the knock in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The pre-looking for the direct leap from the editor to the associated position within the DVI; -file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& kile; provides a corresponding setting for all & latex; -binds files. this only needs to set Modern under Settings Kile... tools of the building.</seg>
<seg id="1794">In order to check prices, the mouse-cursor must be positioned in a line of source code and slept on preference. the jump to the corresponding position in the DVI; viewers will then take place.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & ocular: with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI; document the corresponding & latex; document of & kile; indicated and available for the corresponding line; a text editor must be specified (settings Okular set up... Editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">Should in case of removal of the & DVI; viewers do not agree, an error may appear. if an error appears, this is displayed in the log file or in the news window in summary.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The log file will cause the error source in the source code. in the editor you can see the knobs Typing LaTeX error and NÃ ¤chster LaTeX error and matches the error on the error, must be clicked on the error in the logging line and & kile; jumps to the faulty line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once on the corresponding button in the toolbar button is clicked, a window appears to choose the template for the document. the features presented here are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">For selecting empty document, a document can be written either from scratch or the wizard for quick creation of a new document. more information can be included in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Motive user of & latex; usually use the same introduction for virtually all documents. assists in & kile; created, saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex must be created or created a new file. & kile; can create a new template using an existing document and selection of file template from document... create a new template.</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a template using a file, some strings are replaced by other data (e.g. name or character coding). these variables can be set up in Settings Kile... Settings can be set.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template, it is therefore necessary to know which strings from which variables are replaced:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string will be replaced by entering into document class. typically, it is used as follows:\\ Documentclass [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {article}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The easiest way to create a template is the use of the wizard, and the forwarding of the commands in the editor. once the document was created in this way, the following steps have been accomplished:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document then you can create your own template instead of the default size.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; a simple way to create a template, should be sought after one on the internet and were introduced under the steps described below.</seg>

<seg id="1809">To learn more about & Kate; and his possibilities should be experienced the manual to Kate. users of & kile; can you place there directly with reading the chapter, work with the editor of & Kate; begin.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& kile; offers a very practical & latex; command reference, which can be called the MenÃ ¼ Help LaTeX reference. it includes a detailed description of nearly all commands that can be found in & latex; use as well as their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">A double-click with penetrated strg button to check the & tex; -word out. this means that in this way you click to\\ par from\\ par\\, only\\ par is used only\\ par.</seg>
<seg id="1812">When using the text with penetrated left mouse button, the selected text is automatically copied into the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow keys with penetrated switch-old, parts of the source text can be used in the editor window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& kile; has the possibilities to search the most different types of source texts and to highlight them. for example, the & latex; commands from normal text and also the mathematical formulae are highlighted by another color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants may serve as well as the corresponding button of bookmarks or the corresponding button of bookmarks or the corresponding buttons, highlighted the jump to the same or last jumping brand. this is also the springboard highlighted, so that it is automatically applied during the first input of a character.</seg>
<seg id="1816">Editing is probably one of the main aspects associated with using a program like & kile; even though & Kate; important functions have been added to write a & latex; important functions for writing a & latex; special commands for their selection. under Editions are the following commands to describe their selection:</seg>
<seg id="1817">Weighing a complete paragraph (group of lines that contain on both sides a blank line). with a paragraph there is not a text with continuous lines (as in other text ditations). these advanced meaning slept with tables, & latex; commands and all other lines of source code. the only preventative thing in & kile; is thus that the absorption is separated by two blank lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Choose the word under the current cursor position. this selection also has an extended meaning, since this command also has a latex; commands with a edges (\\) and an additional star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">For setting up a part of the document can be removed from this first. & Kate; provides the keyboard Ctrl; K with which the whole row is removed. & kile; provides with its own commands, for a faster dehydro. under Editing, the following commands are included to the layout of the text:</seg>
<seg id="1820">Remove a complete paragraph. the definition for a paragraph in & kile; is included in the description of all storage volumes.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already clarified that environments play a central role in & latex; therefore offers & kile; for NF additional commands under Edit environment for an easy work with & latex;</seg>
<seg id="1822">This command is enclosed in the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to check the environment.</seg>

<seg id="1957">Default character coding: encoding of newly created or in other way than using file opening open files (where the coding of the file can be passed). however, this setting is loaded from the same in the project features, if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD will be used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD was not detected. however, this setting here is inserted from the same into the project features, if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Creating a backup copy; it creates regularly backup copies, so that in a blackout or crashing over the next start of the program the document can be recovered from this backup. this is not the same as the storing of the file. this is not the same as the storing of the file. also for not yet stored documents will be a backup regularly, according to the specified time, created.</seg>

<seg id="1965">In the area of mouse-click on the structure of the structure, it is possible to change the action by clicking the structural tree with the mouse buttons.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the area of structuring-tree settings, the visibility of nodes can be automatically opened in the tree, the actuality of the tree during the editing process and how deep when changing the structural tree should be opened automatically. blank nodes are the empty areas in the text, while empty groups are such, where no element has been found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The area to the fixing of abbreviations (one type of templates) which can be unfolded in groups, each can be valid for several & DTEP; this means it can give a valid group for PHP in which the ifters detector something else than in a group is valid for Javascript.</seg>

<seg id="1971">Component in "Only-Lese" mode load: check if the plugin is denied boarding. only-Lese Kparts usually refuse the shop if this option is not chosen.</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plugin: is this activated, then testet & quantapron; if the given information is correct, then the storing of the entry is also available if the plugin is not available at the moment, but it should be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantapron; from version 3.3, the fault-search for the no longer necessary built-in & PHP; (3) debugger has been adjusted, as well as the support for the dbg Debugger. instead, a debugger-Plugin concept has been implemented, which enables various implementations about plugins.</seg>

<seg id="1982">The counterpart to debugging session starts the session. closes the connection to the debugger or ends the sounds according to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Send a HTTP request to the server to initiate a debug request. this is synonymous with the use of a browser to view the current document. the output of this requirement is displayed in the debugger issue.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Indicates the debugger to begin with the execution of the script and current information on the monitored variables as well as the current specified line continuously. if this happens when the script is attached, the execution is continued before a debit request has been started, the script starts with the request.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Indicates the debugger to begin with the execution of the script, without information on monitored variables and the current tick number. if this happens, the execution moves further. happens it before a debit request has been given, the execution starts as soon as a requirement is made.</seg>

<seg id="2025">[general] version = use 1 for & quantapron; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for any higher version. name = DTD; / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN) nickname = The simplified name of the DTD. (HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name is used as nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">An action can set up with settings promotions... click New action leads to the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">This promotion is weighted keynote. with clicking the user's button, a keynote can be assigned to a keyboard shortcut; with Keiner is the current keyboard shortcut.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. it can be inserted into the detector settings and in the execution of action this text is inserted in the document to the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this action you can change external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) to change the document or use as input (or parts of the document). examples from & quantapus; self are the quick start-dialogue or the different Behold in... actions for the (X) HTML-DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and interpreter must be specified. example: SH / home / myhome / myscript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir variable in the command line: $KDEHOME / share / dev / quanta / scripts in your path: $PATH There are other special variable that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we replaced with the URL of the current document. in case of a local document file is called file: / from the document name.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% PID: is replaced with the PID of the current & quantapron; only one instance is running, the text is copied to the PID number. this is useful if DCOP is used to control & quantapron; from the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, normally the filename of the current document or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the above methods there can be a script input from & quantapron; at the default record. in the selection field input may be determined what is to send to the standard input. possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected range of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is usually useful only with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">Accordingly, the output can also be redirected. there are two types of output: normal output, written on the default output; error messages, to the default output. it can be specified, which should be done with the text written on the default output by setting the value of the selection panel:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the markup language, it is recommended to share the tags in logical groups. in this case it is necessary to create a toolbar with the name of the market.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar has been added, you must add actions and configure. select settings settings.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are quite self-explanatory. press the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts the editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill in all the required fields and add them to the appropriate toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete everything and, if the tag has attributes and you plan their use, activate dialogue "tag, if available, so that a input is possible when using the action.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is that a ugly symbol. who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol? replace it before we have difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that the action is better represented, we will use & kiconedit; choose from the & menu;, graphic Further programs (or where else it is located in their distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; used by default 32x32 pixels, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit size others.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created symbol does not only help you to remember what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to that the day start, I decided to create a startup as a symbol. through the use of green (green is usually interpreted as los, rigid, further interpreted), or should at least to signaled a message to the user that clicking this symbol is a & lt; start tag in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After the creation of the symbol it must still be connected to the action. this happens through the menu with settings actions... (in & quantapron;) and selection of the desired action. besides the text box is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder in which the stored icon is, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the apply button and continue to continue with other tags, so there are, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some usual & quantapron; functions to the toolbar or it should be shared to a better overview of some separators into several groups. open the toolbar setting dialog by setting the toolbar. make sure that the required toolbar can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to choose the separators (very left above) for my toolbar. according to the selection of the element that is to be added to the toolbar button, you press the arrow key to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I want to preview you a quick way to access the Conqueror Preview. I will pick it and add to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the separators support grouping. someone who does not know my toolbar, could believe that the & Konqueror; button the opposite of the start-button is.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by proving all symbols to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Back up in the correct folder. after new XML does not exist, it will be saved in the correct folder, but your toolbar button should be saved in the correct folder. please match her & descriptionrc; so that their toolbar can be loaded (n) if a file is opened by the appropriate type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most worth enlargement of & quantapus; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scripting language or formatting language you like to most. therefore, this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; Documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentation, you could check in & quantapron; -Repository check if someone has done it for you already.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first, you need to look for an existing documentation for formatting / script / etc; language. then you need to create the docrc file. first part we leave you, the second part we treat here.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc 1 = Section1.html Section 2 = Section1.html Section 2 = Section1.html = Sec2.3.html = Sec2.3.html = Sec2.3.html = Sec2.3.html = Sec2.3.html 2 = tag1.html pages 2 = tag2.html tag3 = tag3.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree tree defines the visible part of documentation in the documentations tree. for example, you can see now in the & PHP; documentation so something:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config File [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element Top Element = PHP 4.2 Specific Table of Contents = index.html geting Started = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = language.basic-synchronat.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is the subfolder in the tree with its own content. there is no known border for the chess box (except for reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">You remember that the index is referenced directly to a file (and consequent at the top end of the building vision & mdash; folder is displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Space can influence nothing but pay attention to & and & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; and lt; in all & XML; -based & quantapus; resources are replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content section is the area of the docrc file which is intended to display the context-context sensitive help. for example, when writing a & PHP; script will display the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file binding.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of seded separate context elements which should be available (for & PHP; these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can easily store your file docrc / share / etc / quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / dev / quanta / doc for local or global use. then create a folder (as specified in your file docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these are well and worth it, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. what documentation were used to the & quantapron; -Community. you will not get rich, but proud to have worked with the best web platform platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantapalle; are you not alone. it is possible to share the separating resources (DTEP Packages, toolbar button with others, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by email to friends, partners or elsewhere. at different places there is an email to send menu entry, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP) with email, in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded to our main archive, from where all other & quantapalle; users can download them and only be available if our team needs them as correct and usefull for publication. to sign the resources to sign the resources, it provides a GPG / PGP key. thus, the origin of the resources is guaranteed, both for our team and for later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">At the uploading, you will be asked for their private GPG key (the Passphrase is not saved), or in the event you have multiple keys you can go on. in dialogue New resource you need to stay empty (URL preview can remain empty) and clicking OK the Upload.</seg>
<seg id="2074">The high load can be uploading from the DTD DTD package (DTEP), uploading the toolbar icons, and in the context menu of files and folders in the Templates and scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, still before installation, investigates & quantapus; the integrity of the resource by checking of integrity and signature. in case of problems wares and it can then be canceled. please note the warning messages carefully. if the integrity is given and the resource correctly signed, a message appears with the indication of the author of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML-languages, which is currently not created by & Quantapron; but the creation may be time-consuming, because hundreds of tag files in the day XML format may be necessary. it gives the easiest way to convert a DTD automatically into a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD shop and Convert a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description which is to be used. after that, the following dialog appear:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target directory: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / dev / quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! DOCTYPE definition: the string that will appear in! DOCTYPE day, such as HTML Public - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / html4 /</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of the DTEP after conversion: if activated, brings & quantapron; after converting the & descriptionrc; Editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this possibility.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & Quantapalle; there are some key concepts. to understand this and get full use of & quantapus; therefore, one must first familiarize themselves with these fundamental concepts. this chapter attempts to bring them precisely these concepts without whose understanding & quantapus; little benefit.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantapalle; the working area is divided into three areas: global, locally and project-related. this distinction affects a number of components in & quantapron;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for each, the & quantapron; it is available. of tool-blasts on actions is all that is marked as globally, in which joint folder structure of & quantapron; saved. this allows the group of administrators differently to secure the toolbar, actions and patterns in the global tree, which is then available to each in a multi-user environment at the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbar. local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are available only within a specific project. this can be everything from & CSS; patterns can be specially formulated for the files of a particular project. simply, this is the most limited size. all elements are set in the folder-tree of the project, which is the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project emboar.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantapron; MDI; consists of some main areas: the editing window, the component views, the cartons with information and the toolbar. please hit, and for more information on these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click on the map-on with the right mouse button to reload a context menu with the current document lists, recharging, delete or uploading the document, jump to a bookmark or version of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Justification in the editing area lead to a further context menu regarding the edited document content, such as basic machining steps (cut / copy / paste), editing of using the mouse-cursor tags, help to the word using the mouse pointer or opening the file, if the string is referred to as a file under the mouse-cursor.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top of the editing window, the toolbar can be found. at present, & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as a standard for which a set of toolbar can be shown. in the course of further development of & quantapus; the toolbar can be adapted to the new functions and related user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbar button is really easy. if they want to insert it; then click the icon that represents the day. now they can insert the data for this just one day. if you want to insert the data for this just one day (such as Anchor), you can fill in a dialog different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The architectural views (QIT;) allow it to open up and strip in the information. in the representation with cartels are available for files, project, templates, scripts, attributes, and documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project Management is a powerful tool that provides all files in the project and allows the managing files in the project by right mouse click. actions like adding, removal, uploading or delete files from storage media can then be performed with the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another option of & quantapalle; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: images, program parts, a whole web page & etc. there are all possibilities open.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories, depending on which it is used. the category is always available, local templates are available only for the respective users and templates in projects are available only in the project. more on templates is available.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information about the available scripting languages. the concept of incorporation in Global, Local and Project also works here. by clicking with the left mouse button you can retrieve the available information on a script. the right mouse button is available for example, to edit, edit or send the script via email.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With this view, one shows the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on an element, the cursor is set to the position of the element. by right-click of an element, a list of commands opens in terms of navigation and refresher of the building.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears under the other construction views. with it can change a fast attributes and namespace. that allows all available attributes with few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation on the Web-technology for your development. it can be downloaded pre-packed documentation for & quantapron; it can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project, project-specific documentation can be edited, edited and viewed.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & Quantapalle; two tabs at the bottom of the window, can be reached via the beneficial information: the news window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This carton shows information about each in Quanta running script. such is the used DTD of the current document and all changes to the DTD.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This carton shows all errors in the pop-up of the current document. & quantapron; scripts that will be executed, give all error messages (so there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaports are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they get the appropriate command displayed. the chocolate page of the toolbar is the opportunity to define own orders as symbols in & quantapron; to define.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantapalle; is the ability to mail a tool toolbar with e-mail. it sends the toolbar as a compressed Tar-archive via & kmail; if they receive a toolbar in an e-mail, they can secure it in & quantapron; like any other backup and load!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to customize the place of & quantapron; autoconf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, enter. / configure --help. the options are easy to understand and not executed here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have trouble downloading & quantapus; you should check if your path contains the & KDE; 3 bin folder. also, you should make sure that no older version of & KDE; 3 in PATH in front of her bin folder. same applies to & Qt.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& Quantapalle; is a web development tool for KDE interface. & quantapalle; was optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">During the endeavor to create the best & HTML; Editor, the developers began to deal with a close idea: what would be if & quantapus would be? well, this would make him an absolutely greatest web development tool for & KDE; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer limited to pure & HTML; it's already far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. together, if you can define it in & XML; then it should be & quantapus; for the appropriate & IDE; be the appropriate & IDE;</seg>
<seg id="2109">Well, to the above claim has to be held that & quantapus; as product is based on the outstanding efforts of the whole & KDE; development community is based on. & Quantapron; as follows, in good use of free software, the idea of why developed? thanks to the & KDE; scaffold is not only this all possible but it allows users and developers, & quantapron; so to broaden how they need it for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantapalle; allows web developers to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this can increase productivity almost every task. through the program Komar you can have to remember them & quantapron, without having to remember a scripting language. (more about it you will find in.)</seg>
<seg id="2111">& quanta; Plus; is a web development environment designed for HTML and related languages. it was designed for a fast web development and was quickly developed to a well-proven editor with many powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& quanta; plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of & quanta; the original developers settled the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Read more in the details of the documentation is associated with help: / quanta (either this URL in & Konqueror; enter, or khelpcenter help: / quanta).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& quanta; is currently developed and supervised by Eric Laffoon sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files you have opened. this list changes every time you open a file which is not located, where the oldest entry is taken out.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to store code parts and whole files as templates for later use. if you're trying to store the selected file / text outside the local / project preschooses, only one error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converts when inserting the clipboard used there special characters to the & HTML; feed, so that they are correctly displayed and not misunderstood by the browser as formatting instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts the text from the clipboard in & URL; write-up, which is the correct way to inserting special characters and spaces in & URL; first and foremost to inserting & URL; s in the anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Switches the block choice respectively. this allows you to select text blocks using the & Shift key.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Goes directly to a line number. this is very helpful if your & PHP; script error messages can occur!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Searches for a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a type of grep or sed with GUI and predefined phrases to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window or not. that's the window in which you can see the display of scripts and debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Initial and intimidant of problem-porters at the bottom of the & quantapron; main window. the problem reporter is activated once you change the structural tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the toolbar icons on the left of the main window. this column allows you to set bookmarks with one mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there is bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu along with the entries previous or next, depending on the position of the cursor in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other open documents appear in the menu grouped according to the filename of other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from the hard disk. & quantapus; -projects are stored with the file called .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog to insert files into the current project. selected files will then be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Through the project directory for new files that could be there. this enables to copy the video files into your project folder or subfolders and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Load the files in your project on the server high. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & KDE; and if you have downloaded more input / output module (KIO Slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings, how & quantapus; the project manages. in chapter & quantapron; - Projects you will find the details explained.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Loads a project-toolbar. these are kept in project you / toolbars and are only available in this menu when you have assigned it to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to store your toolbar. allows you to select the type of toolbar button: locally or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new toolbar. this creates just the name. actions must be saved using settings actions... added to the toolbar or you will be asked to save whether you want to store the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Remove a toolbar from the field of view. this deletes it from the hard disk. if you have not yet saved the toolbar, you will be asked if you want to do it.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send their own toolbar button to someone (perhaps to the & quantapron; -team so that the toolbar can be present in the next publication). the menu item opens a new e-mail message with the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Allows uploading of the toolbar on the main server, where everyone can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Download one & DTD; that you or anything else has made and convert to the & quantapron; own description-format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Download / refresh the entities from the & DTD; it is useful when the entities "entities" from the & DTEP; to renew it without the whole & DTEP; if this is global and a typist in the global KDE folder is not available, the shop fails.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags. if the standard (HTML;) toolbar is loaded, there is a submenu standard included in the Tags menu, which contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current tag dialog, if there is one. this entry is always present in the menu tags, followed by & DTD; -specific submenu.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activates or deactivates the intelligent inserting of tags. currently this only works with (X) HTML DTDs. intelligent insertion means that & quantapus means that the insertion is denied by means of toolbar, if this day contradicts the rules.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plug-in menu the available plugins are listed under the listed menu items. click on them. click on a activated plug-in deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Chooses the syntactic mode for the current file. the list of available highlighting schemata is dependent on derkate; - version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Choose the type of line identifier. very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms to develop. choose Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Checks the syntax of the current document according to the selected & DTD; by means of the external application tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Immediate switching between the different types of user interface. due to some limitations in the KDE libraries you can sometimes need time or rather beautiful graphics. recommended is the cartel mode, which is also the default setting, or the subwindow mode, which corresponds to the representation in & quantapron; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu contains an associated entry. with a selection of an entry, the corresponding subwindow will be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Enables displaying the status bar at the bottom of the & quantapron; main window to or out.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog catches any application that use the KHTML part, including the & Conqueror; web browsers.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Is the behavior of the editing window. in the documentation of & Kate; you can find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears in which you can delete entries from the toolbar or which changes the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should generate an aid in accordance with the environment of the mouse cursor, but is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantapalle; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed, but as with every open source project the developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantapron; development in financial form, they find here the way.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should be completed best from top to bottom, since e.g. after filling out the project called the whole directory structure for the rest of the project. all these paths and author information fields can later be set with Shift; F7 project project-characteristics can be set.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project to include, for example foo. when entering name file file will be automatically filled.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantapron; project file. by default, she has the name of the project in small letters and without spaces with the extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can access the server address of the machine to which one wants to access, except one processed local data. either a name (hostname.Ex.de) or an IP-address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">Lets you empty this field empty, the default settings of the selected protocol is used. depending on the configuration of the remote host, an adjustment could be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder in which the templates are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default templates. if a joint collection of files used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder in which the toolbar can be saved for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default toolbars. if a common collection of files used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to insert files from the local file system into the project. you can select multiple files or whole folder.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change. for server script script (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Defective, if files located somewhere in the main folder of the project, are to be integrated. if a project is started again on new, non-haken.</seg>
<seg id="2165">This option will display all the files and folders within the main folder and you can make a precise selection of couches.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the main folder. you can select the desired files by clicking or by removing the hash out of the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project assistant contains three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be uploading in the menu with project project properties in the menu window profiles or with the keyboard shortcut shift; F7 changed.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project assistant and are described in. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of filename (placeholder possible), which are newly-related to project-related operations such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Complementary option to top, also files that are listed in .cvsignore are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded at opening the project. in addition, more about project views can be read.</seg>

<seg id="2173">In the subwindow profiles can upload high ladeprofiles (see in), as well as the display of a building-view for the content of the server for each profile by pointing a separate building-view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the subwindow team configuration, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see in the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the subwindow event configuration, one can switch event actions and add these actions, modify or delete them. event actions are executed when a previously defined event occurs, like the sickle of a file. see in the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Default opens & quantapron; the last project that was open. this behaviour can not be influenced by default.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, select project... from the menu project or the icon project open from the toolbar. the dialog project will be displayed and allows selection of a project. projects have .webprj as an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">If & quantapalle; closed, the project file is automatically saved. you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving if & quantapron; changed files. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project management gives free access to the files in the project. there, files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folders act as well, however the entries are opening and opening with... in line with the right mouse button in the context menu:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can select different profiles. the profile contains information about the place of the uploaded files. see below.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows removal of the current profile. if only one profile is available, the button will end to remove the removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password will be kept in the core memory and can be forgotten where most frequent loading of files is necessary and the rather insecure password can be saved on the plate -option does not come into question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & Quantapalle; many flood profiles can be created and thus loaded the project (or parts of the project) to different servers. when editing or creating a profile will display this dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server, to which the files are to be copied. either a fully qualified Domainname or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & KDE; and the installed Kio Slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (locally) and NFS.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for transfer. usually this does not have to be changed, except the network administrator has a service not at the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your anxiety, this is either a time-saving function or danger. use it at your discretion. the password is stored on the plate so that it can not be easily read, but everyone with programming results can easily be seen in the plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is just a set of files and toolbar. it can give in a project many views, i.e. through simple diving view, various files and toolbar can be loaded and replace the currently open files and toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be opened in the menu project or the project toolbar, accessible via settings on the toolbar toolbar, open or deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantapron; with which one has to do most. this helps not only increase productivity, but also allows the adaptation of & quantapus; to its own working method.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above are the toolbar quirsts in & quantapron; the best about the menu toolbar can be made. the adding of the toolbar can be treated below in the section Adding of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbar and symbols can be adjusted using the context menu (right-click on the toolbar button), in which with New action, a new toolbar can be executed, which results in the dialog, which can be specified in the dialog where actions can be visible on this or other worktoolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu for an action (icon) on a toolbar, additionally the entries are removed and action are displayed, which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbar and the actions on them can set up in the menu with Settings toolbar and set the settings.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are essentially related Documents, code-cutters and files to the linkage. & quantapron; used templates basically like a nasty filesystem with expansive organization and interfaces. you can copy, move or change any at the system existing folder into the default tree. templates have in & quantapron; in about the restrictions you can imagine for the filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantapron; provided templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions specified in the beginning of each template.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary is all that is not purer text. it can be any file except text, so images, & PDF; s, Flash files & etc. binary templates are usually included in documents using linkups (e.g. images with IMG src = / src / url). some examples can be found in the Pre-tree under global templates. further information on the Templates tree is available.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be created from any text document. on the basis of these templates, new documents can be created. normally, more specific documents can be found in appropriate subfolders. some examples can be found in advance-tree under global templates. see in for more information on the Templates tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This type of templates is useful if not a new document is to be inserted based on a template, but the same text area is always included in the documents. some examples are available in line-tree under global templates. see in for more information on template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates serve for whole sites as templates. they are a collection of various documents which can be organized in a folder structure, pours in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantapron.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Create a document structure according to exposure (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;) and select File As Save as a template as a local template...</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once that is done, notice that (even if it was saved as a project template) the template is not visible in the project-tree. take a look at the default tree under project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click File As you save your selection as a local / project template. alternatively, the selection can be simply dragging and dragged onto the building-view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file can only be copied into a suburb folder. you can use all file management functions to be used for example, to move and paste or paste into the file tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can click into the file tree or project files to create a folder on the right, and select site template, a name for the template and secure. by default the project folder will be saved, but of course it can be saved as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates allow a very purged-oriented preview mode. you can create headlines and footer lines or dynamically with & PHP; shape, insert files or link with them. additionally you can keep some things in the contacting of templates in projects very profound.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The structure structure in the subwindow templates is based on the files placed in $KDEDIR / share / apps / quanta / templates and $HOME / .kde / templates / quanta / templates. each one of these folders corresponds to one of four types of container, as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To set the behavior of a folder in the default overview with the right mouse button on the folder and select in the context menu properties. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection panel with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is cancelled, as soon as Elterous attributes are hallowed.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and does not fit for anything except the tribal folders in default overview. if a regular folder would be set out in principle except they would be explicitly activated. in case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text-tree. if nothing appears, you will probably be in a regular folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows the illustrated headlines or headlines for templates in this folder. this may be general headlines or footers for all templates for a specific project and allows for copying contents into a folder with special headlines / headlines a whole presentation already with the matching headers / footer.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you have a context menu (click on the right mouse button) via a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and insert templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& Quantapalle; offers two modes: VPL; Editor and VPL; & source code editor used via the menu View. the first mode replaces the source code editor in two parts: the source code editor and the VPL; -Editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; Editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -page and a cursor appears. then you can edit and turn when needed to the source code editor, in which the changes performed in the VPL; Editor is visible in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; Editor on a document that contains & PHP; it is not possible to edit this directly with the VPL; editor. to edit & PHP; to edit, the source code editor will continue to edit. there is no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works exactly like the first, except that the changes are visible in the source text editor and in the VPL; Editor is already active, this mode is already active, the keypress release the active cursor from a window to another, where the position in the document is maintained.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronization distance between the VPL; Editor and the source code editor is adjustable via settings Quanta. you can choose between synchronisation after one click or automatically. in addition, the recommendation can be set between synchronisation after one click or automatically. in addition, the recommendation may be set in addition to the time span. basically the recommendation is recommended for fast calculator and a large spine for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of the website, so is tools possible. this document features will also be called once a new document is created with the VPL; editor will also be created when a new document is created with the VPL; the editor will also change the reduction of the suspension. this allows you to change the following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines. meta-elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below. a click into the list allows changing the content, e.g. keywords on the column names and keyword keyword 2 on the content -column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way to design the view of pages in the browser. you can add CSS-rules with the buttons under the list or delete a change about the list is exactly as possible with meta-elements. editing of CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS-style template by pressing the file-open button and select the corresponding file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The use of the cursors is as usual in a text processing, possible by due to the arrows, possible. under rare circumstances the cursor works as usual. text can be inserted as usual. text can be inserted by typesar and slipped by means of return or removal.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Inserting tags will be done in the same way via the toolbar button, as in the source code editor, made. it is to note that inserting tags previously already existing identical tags are not removed e.g. when an anchor day, surrounded by text, any other circumference anchor must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some of the toolbar icons such as the tables assistant or the lists assistant are disabled. they will be later used in & VPL; in this release you have to use the tables or lists of the toolbar.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools for the same. so why & kdiff3; let me briefly explain why I have written.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The conduction was very complicated, because one of the contributors had done many changes and at the same time had corrected a lot of positions in the same file. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result was numerous conflicts in the merging.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program used by me only showed me the modified lines, but I could not see what exactly changed within these lines. and there was no indications of the places where perhaps only the objection had changed. the merging of these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">So that was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could be differences within one line and changes to white signs. later, any amount of more useful functions have been added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to compare your text quickly, simply copy it into the clipboard and paste it in one of the comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function made a lot of work was the same and merging of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost in a full file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way-assembling is fully supported. this is useful when two people work independently of each other in one piece of code and make changes. the original file (the base) helps dissolve conflicts and displays at the same time the expected result. in this Editor, you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three Quell files in the assembling:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; helps you also with the comparisons and merge complete folder. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; in the folder-assembling:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; displays the exact differences and load the possibilities of present color monitors. if you often have to check code, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white signs and tabs are shown visible. if lines differ only in a certain number of white signs, one can see this on a look at the summary in the column on the left side. (no hassle) if someone changing the indentation.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">When a file is identical, and the other is different in one line, then the color shows that file is different. red color means that both files differ.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name, but in different folders, you can make yourself the tipping work easier by simply write the filename of the first file completely.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Cold 3 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 3 folder 2 folder 3 folder 3 folder.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Opening-dialog allows manual verification of filename, the selection over the file browser (file...) or the output of a recently opened file from the folding list. you don't need to specify third file next time. you do not need to specify third file; if you leave the entry for C, the analysis of differences with two files will be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2295">About the button folder... you can also select a folder. if you choose a folder, the same or merging of folders. if for A file is selected, for B and C however a folder, then used & kdiff3; the filename from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If interwoven, the input field is actively involved and can be processed. however, it is not necessarily required to specify an output file immediately. you can get this step later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The setup button opens a dialog with settings. here you can set options before you start using the same / assembling.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to select text parts from the clipboard into the active comparative window. in the opening dialog you don't have to select files, you can simply close the dialog with the interrupt button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and drop: just drag a file from a file manager or select text from one editor and let it fall over a comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">Which thought is behind it? sometimes, a file contains e.g. several similar features. if you would like to find out how similar to these functions, this would be a relatively large effort. they would have only to load two corresponding files, load them in & kdiff3; download and then compare them. now, you can simply copy the relevant sections simply, paste and then compare.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: at present, you can not pull anything out of & kdiff3; only the pitfalls of text in a comparative window will be supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the pulling and drop text into another program as outcrop and inserting (instead of copying and inserting). in such a case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">In the upper part of any text window there is the info-line. the info-line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window C is optional.) Any info-line has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, you can rest the mouse over the line. then a small Help window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are the letters A, B and C. a color covers blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these preferences can be changed via the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">When a difference is detected, one sees the color which file differs. if both files differ, the default color is different. (color for conflicts in settings). color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files. that's in the next section (lead) well.</seg>
<seg id="2306">Links next to the text is the summarizing column. if differences were found, the column displays the corresponding color. in some programming languages, the color is not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (at C / C + +, e.g. are white signs only in strings and commentary, relevant for preprocessor and in few, rare individual cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line that separates the merging column from the text, is interrupted on the places where the respective source file has no lines. if the line is activated, the line is shown to be broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (among the comparisons) also has a info-line with the wording output:, the filename, and [changed] if you have edited the result. usually it contains the automatic merging already text, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are dissolved, the store is disabled!!! (use the buttons sprats to the next stem / unresolved conflict in order to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparisons are used, each distinction can also be solved at the same time a conflict which has to be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Through a click with the left mouse button in one of the windows that is highlighted to the line belonging group in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed. (this will also be the current group.) This group is highlighted the current group. it is highlighted with color background color for current area and each on the left appears a black beam.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes through the automatic merge or by manual editing no further line will be left in the group; then there is only a space holder for the event that you can change your mind and perhaps choose another source. this text does not appear in the final stored file, nor in a marker that you may copy and paste elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; summarizing; however, appears in the clipboard if you copy such text from the result window. go carefully with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: if when selecting the sources the options are ignore or ignoredC / C + + comments are activated, changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigating is navigated mainly with the image function and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard left, right, high, down, page, page, end, Strg-Start and Strg end, Siw as you can also use it from other programs. the excess column next to the vertical picture bar can also be used by clicking on the Navid.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the box you can also use the other buttons to edit. with the insertion button you can switch between inserting and overload mode. (default is the insert mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the summaries columns synchronizes the view of all windows on the beginning of each group (as previously described in the section together and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar button contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-down / Strg-up), to the next / previous conflict (roadmap) or to the next / previous conflict, continue to be considered as a conflict. hence, there must be no conflict between deleted and unresolved conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the marker into the clipboard, you need to copy the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-insertion). however, there is also the option to automatically copy the copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-insertion). however, the option is automatically copied, automatically into the clipboard and copying manual copying. be careful with this option but you could not overwrite the content of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Ceilers are stored in accordance with the underlying operating system. Unix-versions use a line-like mark\, and Win32-based systems use wagon + Zeilenvort\\ r\. Kdiffusion 3 reserves the line of source files, therefore you should use & kdiff3; also do not use binders files.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of the recently used files will be automatically saved at the following start and restored at the next start. (menu Settings - &gt; Kdiffusion 3 set up...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a font with fixed width. (on some systems the dialog sets with variable width to choose from, you should not use it.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you activate this option, differences are shown in cursive script. if the selected script does not support this representation, nothing happens at all.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in its pure form, but would be recasted. on these systems, the button presets automatically introduces a odd color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">When this option is activated, the corresponding number of space is inserted at the back of the table button. otherwise, a tabulator sign is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you enter input or return, the insertion of the previous line will be automatically used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">When this option is activated, each selection will automatically be copied to the clipboard. the manual does not copy the clipboard into the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which line-type you prefer to save. the value is the generally usual selection on the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In the comparisons of files tries & kdiff3; first to find all completely identical lines in source files. only during this first step white signs can be ignored. the second step does not compare any line. in this step white signs are not ignored. also in the merging, white signs are not ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a wagon drop '\'. usually ignored & kdiffuse '\'. usually ignored & kdiff3; the car backups are visible, however, such as a white sign is treated. during the merging this option has to be deactivated. in default, this option is deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In default, this option is disabled. in the first part of the analysis are numbers and related characters ('0' - '9', '.' - '). in the result the differences are still displayed, but they are treated like white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In the default setting this option is disabled. changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intense after even smaller differences. the option is activated in default. it is effective for complicated and large files, but slowly with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">The auto-jump-jump mode determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before the next unsolved conflict will continue.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Dissolves automatic all conflicts in white signs by using the chosen file as a source. (preset manual selection.) This is useful when white signs in many files are less important. if you need it only from time to time, then use the automatic selection also conflicts in numbers or comments, if the options are ignore or ignororiere C / C + + comments.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are treated in the chapter for scanning of folders and transmissions. see for details on documentation for directory-comparison and assembling.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is stored and already an older version exists, then the original version exists the Suffix .orig. if there is already such a backupfile with the Suffix .orig, it will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adapts the language of the user interface. changing this option does not affect the current running program. you need to stop and restart it. (this option is active in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is globally adjusted via the control center.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following encoding settings can be adjusted separately for each entry. if you activate this option, the upper setting is used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">About the drop-down fields for coding appears a short notice of what the local coding is. (this can not be changed here and has purely informal nature.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file encoding for source files. this influences how special characters treat and interpretations. since the encoding for each file is individually adjustable, even files can be compared and combined with different encoding.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can choose which code to be used for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-processing commands, they may not work with your codec. (e.g., your files may be 16-bit ASCII, but the editor command can only be set with 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can specify the coding of the output of pre-processor command.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn off this to suppress up changes in white characters in the text or headings. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignore or ignororiere C / C + + comments.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all the differences between two of three files will be displayed. however, you might just want to see the differences between two of three files. according to the selection from A & lt; -gt; C or B & lt; -gt; C is displayed beside the normal still a second overhead column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen rather for long lines. leaf simply type the less important window. (this option is in the window-menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Orders the comparative window in side or over each other. this can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the window-menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you consider the differences and then decide to merge the files together. a simple click starts merging and use the filename of the last source file as precaried name for the output file. (if this function is used to restart the assembling, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file it will be handed over to this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command can be visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own preprocessor that corresponds exactly your requirements. you can use this function e.g. to uncut parts or correcting the indentation.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file it is handed over to this external command. if also a normal pre-processor command is specified (see above), then the output of the command is used only when selecting the previous command. you can write your own preprocessor that corresponds exactly your requirements. each entry line must have an associated issue line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind it is to allow the user more flexibility when setting up the Diff results. but for this, an external program is needed, and most users do not want to program it yourself. however, the good news is that in most cases sed or perl completely sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this pre-processor command to convert the input into large letters: sed 's /\\'\\ 1 / 'The. * is a ergulary expression of the text displayed on each string. the\\ 1 is based on the found text in the first clammernfew.\\ U turns the found text in big letters.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to include automatically generated strings (info: / cvs / _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BA</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you're going to experiment with sed, you might begin to understand it and maybe you like these regular expressions even. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">The ignoring of numbers is actually a built-in function in Kdiffusion 3. but it is good as an example of a further pre-driven command for Zeilenabequals. sed 's / [0123456789.-] / / g' Each sign between '[' and ']' is a matches, and each matches is replaced with nothing, so practically erased.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several options at once. then you can use the Semicolon ';' use to separate the compositions of each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed, you can also use something other such as perl use. perl -p -e's / REGEXP / replacement / switch 'allerdings include in perl some details differently. where sed\\ (and\\) needs perl only (and) without the'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data according to the normal preprocessor shall be maintained for viewing and bringing together. the further operations only change the data that the Zeilenabequals-Algorythmus.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases when you use a normal Preprocessor, the line-in-preprocessor sees the output of the normal pre-processor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function, the text changes or differences, you can not notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often, programmers need to edit many files in a folder. for this reason you can compare with & kdiff3; complete folder recursively compare and merge together.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a suggestion for each object to create a proposal; you can customize the proposal before the start;</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the merging and displays the simulated changes without having to perform,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... leads selected actions either with all (F7 button), or only with selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is similar to the same and merging of individual files very similar. you just have to specify folder on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three folders will be merged, folder 1 is used as a base. if no target folder was specified, used & kdiff3; folder 3 as target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts, do not start bringing together, you have to select the appropriate menu entry or press the F7 button. (further details follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folder you will find a small news window on the current progress. if you cancel the scanning of the folder, only the files are listed, which were compared to that.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning the folder is complete, displays & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left side,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and each folder found during the scan, is shown here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is normally folded. you can double click on the + / - click on the object, or by clicking the arrow buttons on the left / right. the directory menu contains two functions All subdirectories, folders and all subdirectories with which you can set up all the folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">When you double click on a file, the file will be started and it appears as a comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The symbol in the column Name reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folder, then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object. in such a case the contraceple action will not be automatically selected. if the merging of this is started, you will be informed about the problems of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the above picture, are used in the columns A / B / C the colours red, green, yellow and black.</seg>
<seg id="2376">With identical entries, the colour is also identical even if the age of the entries are different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered identical if their entire content is identical. then you have the same color. with folders, the age is immaterial to its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea for this colour scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a leaf again, which is only green, then yellow and later when it is old, red becomes red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical, but not B: copy from B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B identical, but not C: copy of C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical, but not A: copy from A (or if A does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same file type (e.g. if A folder and B file is): error: conflicting file types. as long as such faulty objects exist, the collapse can not be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same file type (e.g. if A folder and B file is): error: conflicting file types. as long as such faulty objects exist, the collapse can not be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The mode for synchronizing is active if only two folders and no explicit target folder were specified and when the option directories synchronizing it. then chooses & kdiff3; the necessary action to be identical. if for an entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist, but not identical: perform and save the result in both folders. (the user sees the visible filename for the output file only B; directly after the assembling, copied & kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">When two folders will be merged and the option new file will be selected instead of executing (uncertain), then the exact date appears, but the date is identical. if the files are different, but the date is identical. if such errors are not eliminated, the merging of the folders cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">During the merging, one file is working after another. it's status column shows heap when the merging was successful, and according to other messages when something inexpected occurred, you should make a final review and check if the status is in order.</seg>
<seg id="2388">When in the furniture dialog, the file is selected full analysis, Kdiffusion will display more columns. these contain the number of odd, deleted, not whiter and white conflicts. (the column for solved conflicts will only be displayed when three folders are compared or combined.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge the straight selected entry (file or Odner), or all entries are selected at once. if you have selected all the intertwater actions (also in all subfolders), you can start the assembling.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you have not specified a target folder, then the three-folder-assembling mode will be used as the target, when two-folder collapse, B is chosen as a target and used when synchronisation is used A and / or B as a destination.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a target folder, please check if all entries will be displayed in the target folder. there are some options that could be skipped in the folder structure. check out these options to avoid unnecessary surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries: select directory together / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the shortcut). to run only the current record: select action of the current element or push F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If through conflicting data types still exist even invalid acts, a message appears on the faulty elements. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">If you merge all entries, a dialog box will appear with the options, simulate and break down.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select simulate when you first want to see what would happen without which really changes. you will then get a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then execute certain actions with all entries. if a manual procedure is necessary (merge a single file), then it opens up a merging window (note the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">If you are finished with a file, select once again or press F7. if you have not yet saved, a corresponding dialogue will appear. then you will continue working with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If & kdiff3; to make a mistake, appears a message and detailed status information. at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you to skip the cause of the problem. so you have the option to select another action for the entry or solve the problem in a different way before proceeding with the assembling.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been individually combined, you notice & kdiff3; these entries are not saved again in the current session) and execute them at the later date, these entries have been translated or not saved, these entries will be taken as being done. only if you change the merging action, these entries will again be merged.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (menu Settings - &gt; Kdiffusion 3 setup...) has now a section called Inventory assembling with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that are fit to the specified pattern are displayed in the elementary tree. separate the patterns with a semicolon; and valid Placeholder: '*' and '?'. (such as * .cpp; * .h). folders do not need to match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders in this pattern are not displayed in the elementary tree. it can be entered more than a pattern, use the Semicolon; as separator. valid Placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders in this pattern are not displayed in the elementary tree. it can be entered more than a pattern, use the Semicolon; as separator. valid Placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS. many autonomous files will be ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this folder specifically can be set with a .cvsignore file. (see under info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some fileset files, files have a plugged attribute. in other filesystems marks a leading point. a file is hidden as hidden. this option allows you to decide whether these files are to be displayed in the elementary tree or not. this option is switched on in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">For links to files: when the option is switched off, symbolic linkages are compared. if the option is switched on, the files are compared to which the links show. this is disabled in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">If the option is switched off, the symbolic links are compared. if the option is switched off, the links will be treated like normal folders and reportedly checks on possible recurrenditions. a link to a folder of a link to yourself will result in a final loop and crushed.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Executes a full analysis of each file and displays statistics columns. (the total analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and substantially slower if they are applied to files that will not contain any text. (specify an appropriate anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders over a slow network, it will possibly work faster, just change the date and file size. however, this speed is a degree of security. please use caution. this option is adjustable in default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to confidential the change of issue. there will be no real comparison. the files are considered identical if they are identical in size. that can be useful for example when copying the changestion issue is lost. please use caution. this option is adjustable in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activates the synchronization mode when two folders are compared and no target folder was specified. in this mode, the proposals to the collapse you are identical. also the results of the merging of files are stored in both folders. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, will be suggested instead of the assembling the newer file as action. (this is considered insecure, because it is assumed that the other file has not been changed. you should consider it in any case.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder will be replaced or deleted, then the original version will be renamed and the extension .origine extension already exists, then this will be deleted without further backup. this also concerns the normal clashes of individual files, not just the merging of your files. this option is switched on in default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally, the folder-merge view remains visible to the merging of single files; you can switch the window parts using the mouse. if you don't want this, you can switch the window folder window in the window menu and switch from switch between directory & text windows between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Probably you prefer to compare a file simply by double-clicking. nevertheless, there is also a corresponding menu entry. you can save a single file associated with the merge menu. once you save the result, the status will be done and the file will not be merged again when you launch the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2416">This status is lost however, if you read the directory again: directory menu: new to read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparent with the help of KIO-slaves. Kdiffusion 3 uses this to read files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders to open, which are located on local or remote computers.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with one on a FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax as a local files and folders. a few things should note:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relative. or.. included. that is with URLs not possible, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masonry. (# - &gt;% 23, space line &gt;% 20, etc. for example, has a file with the name / # foo # the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the file system on the server, sometimes through the protocol. it follows a short list of constraints:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be differed whether a link indicates a file or folder. then always a file is accepted as a link target. (FTP:, SFTP:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to edit authorization or change issue. therefore, the authorization or change of change from the original. (note the option confidential the size.) (This is only possible with local files).</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main uses of the main uses is currently considered differences-viewer in KDevelop. KDevelop first always starts the built-in-in-viewer. to display Kdiffusion 3, press the right mouse button over the Different viewer and then select In Kdiffusion 3Part display from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Usually requires & kdiff3; two complete input files. however, if it is applied as a sound file, it adopts & kdiff3; the names of original files from the patch file. at least one of the two files must exist. then start & kdiff3; the program patch to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the context menu you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview. please note that this does not work if any of the original files exists. furthermore, this is unreliable when the original files have changed since generating the patch file.</seg>
<seg id="2428">When & kdiff3; as part executed, it supports only the same of two files, a very small toolbar or menu. the merging or the same of folders will not be supported in the KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and Kdiffusion 2 (now Heist are compare) there already. in addition, the name Kdiffusion 3 already indicates that it may result together as the program diffuse 3 from the Diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I use GPL-programs already very long and have learned a lot by having seen in the sources of other programs. this is my thanks to all programmers who have gone this path or going to go so.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You have compiled the program from the sources, and the configure script will probably not find the correct prefix to KDE. in the default installed configure in / usr / local, but then KDE can not find the resources for the user interface (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find further information on this subject.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines are first mentioned as identical; however, if only a non-white signs is different, the line will be treated as not identical. if similar lines are going to be identical to each other, this hiis the purpose this is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor notes for each difference in the files where he starts and where it ends. however, this important information is simply lost if the result is simply saved as text file and it is much effort to design extra a private file format which could store this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort for this was so far too big. you can recover a certain version always by selecting a source A / B / C. to edit larger quantities of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text suddenly lt; No src lints; published and the text cannot be extinguished. what does that mean and how can it be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; used already many colors to highlight of differences. even more highlighting would be confusing and lacking the purpose. please use another editor.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and fault reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To be able to use all functions of & kdiff3; you need & KDE; 3.1 or newer.</seg>

<seg id="2443">Since & kdiff3; autoconf and vein, you should not have any problems with compiling. should nevertheless difficulties occur, please report on the & KDE; -Mailinglists of it.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut (Strg-X or Umschalt-Removal) copies into the clipboard and deletes the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or enschalt insertion) adds the text from the clipboard at the current cursor position or replaces the current marking system.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only differences: files that are identical in all folders, do not appear in the folder structure, and therefore not in the target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, you will have to update any changes to these options to read the folder with the function Update.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">There are only entries displayed, the differences are shown. if the target folder does not contain these files in the target folder. if the target folder does not already contain these files, they are not missing in a later program version. (the behaviour will probably be off in a later program version.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to choose the source with the label A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the lines are displayed from the corresponding window to the end of the selected group on the result window (if they are not already available). if the lines are already present, it will be removed when clicking on the button accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In the default setting this option is disabled. underdifferences in individual characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated as variations in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & kpager will show a thumbnail of all virtual working spaces. it is quite handy to see the ongoing programs on the workspace to change their size, they stop or move it. this works both inside a desktop and several.</seg>

<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it will be necessary to reduce the answers times of & KDE; in case of sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should be aware of which places a mouse click without effect will remain: the click on the neutral components of windows or on places in browser window that does not represent a link, does not lead to unloaded reactions. you can therefore park the mouse on such places until you want them to use them again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">When your mouse rugged, you should clean your mouse. this is usually quite simple. the trick is that you can not only clean the mouse ball, but also the roles that come in touch with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First, you need to take the mouse ball out. as that happens, from mouse to mouse is different. however, it should be quickly clear when you look at the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the roles. these are located on the sides of the hole where the ball was used. dirt and dirt can easily be scrapped with a flat blade or the finger.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations the operating system breaks off the execution of & kmousetool; if you're just going to use the smart amplifier, this means that & kmousetool means that this operation can no longer end by the slogan of the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; to use another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you can run for yourself a mouse-click. here is the status of & kmousetool; reset and you can continue as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, tries & kmousetool; continue to run mouse clicks and continue the cursor to another place.</seg>

<seg id="2522">Use the smart expulsion not if you just start using & kmousetool; select text instead as follows: do you move at the end of the text field a mouse click and keep the switching button pressed while you move the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and again hit the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse-click. this is every time when & kmousetool; the mouse button presses a sound like a mouse-click. so you know exactly when with the intelligent reference it begins. later you can use the smart amplifier even without the audible mouse click. however, it requires some exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & kmousetool; to be able to use the Xtest extension for & X Window; this should be the case in most systems.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse clicks is only available if the system has a sound card and speaker and can be set up correctly.</seg>

<seg id="2620">Filter are one of the advanced abilities of & ktts; for normal working with & ktts; filter is not required.</seg>
<seg id="2621">Filtering text will be edited, before it becomes sent to the program Speech dispatcher. they are useful for improving pronunciation to select false words or abbreviations, to select a suitable language and speaker, or to deal with certain shortcomings of voice synthesizer and their voices.</seg>
<seg id="2622">To understand the working method of filters, it is important to know how the program "Speech dispatcher" works with a text. & ktts; distinguishes four types of texts.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The edition of Screen Reaws has the highest priority. it will be preceded to all other orders and keeps these orders. if the edition of the screen reader has been read, the orders are continued again.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important news as & eg; processor is becoming hot reserved. a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders are continued after the issue of warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">News have the next highest priority. a message breaks normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that uses news. while you want to read a long text on a website, you can see with & kmouth; someone who just enter the room. & KDE; messages are also messages. read on this.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text orders. each order that you encounter from the map card is a text contract. KSayit is an example of an application that uses text contracts. text contracts are thought for the output of longer texts that do not have special urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four orders are labeled in queue, except for the issue of screen regulators. if an application sends the output of a screen report, while & ktts; just such a pre-read, this issue will stop and ended.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First you need to know that filters will never be applied to the output of screen revisions. you will be applied to normal warnings, messages and text contracts as well as on & KDE; -News.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filter by the text and enter it on the next filter. at the moment there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are carried out as modules. in the future, there are still further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">String quad can replace parts of a text by other text. the referral pieces can be supplied either as words or as a regular expressions. it is supplied with predefined strings (e.g.: -) by text or for the formatting of messages from & conversation; or & kmail; in a better intelligible form.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; reformer use a XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert & XML; from a format into another format. in the scope of & ktts; some XSLT files are included in the translation of & XHTML; in SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With speaking optional filters, you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that send the text to & ktts; if you have used for example on the cartels speaker to read a female voice, you can read text of KDE messages about it. Siehe. read about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these different filters are adjustable rules, according to which it is applied to a voice output. if the filter suggests that his rules does not apply, he returns the text unchanged to the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">If a text message, a message, warning or a & KDE; -notification to & ktts; sent, it will be edited through all activated filters listed on the page below. processing by the filters are performed in the order from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This displays the list of the furnished normal filters. if a filter is not crossed, it is not activated and is not used. filter are removed from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter. select the type of filter, and it will be shown below the following furniture dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2638">For setting up strings, you must enter a list of words or regular expressions as a reference pattern. these patterns will be found in the text, then the text will be exchanged for the associated replacement text. large - and spreadings will not be noticed when compared.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Enter a name for your filter. this name you can choose any number, it must be distinguished only by the name of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the strings in the column, and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column. the list is displayed in the order from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to move the marked word or the regular expression in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2642">With these buttons, you can load a list of words or regular expressions out of a file that list current list or delete a list from a file, the entries will be displayed from the file to the existing list.</seg>
<seg id="2643">Here is a language registered, the filter is only applied to display a list of languages listed here. click on the button to display a list of languages. you can also select multiple languages if you click the & Ctrl; button pressed.</seg>
<seg id="2644">If a value is registered, the filter is only applied if the text comes from one of the specified applications. you can enter several programs separated by commas. example: conversation, kmail</seg>
<seg id="2645">The application ID-run programs can be obtained with the program qdbus;. the & DBus; numbers, you have to wedge you. if for example & qdbus; the application ID Copper-3432 indicates, you may only enter.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The filter reduction filter is only applied to the text, if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Diesen filters when match. are all input fields blank, the filter is applied to all texts.</seg>
<seg id="2647">In comparison of words the string module has regular expressions in form\\ s word\\. the words must therefore be limited by separator (spaces).</seg>
<seg id="2648">In this manual you will find no instructions for writing regular expressions. if you have installed the & KDE; regular & # 160; regular expressions, you can call it in the dialogs add or edit any help to the merging of these expressions. the & KDE; -Editor & # 160; regular & # 160; expressions can be found in the package.</seg>

XSLT (XML; Style Language - Transforms) is a W3C standard for such reformats. however, it can only be applied to well-shaped XML. the auxiliary program xsltproc must be installed on your system.</seg>
<seg id="2650">Enter the path for the program xsltproc. if xsltproc is accessible via the ambient variable PATH is also enough xsltproc.</seg>
<seg id="2651">With the speaker filter, you can send texts to a specific speaker, which is placed on the cartels speaker, or to a speaker with specific properties. you can choose for example that texts by kmail can be read by a female voice. see.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Before & ktts; add a text to the filter, there is a spokesman for the text. the speaker is selected based on the speaker properties that sends the text to & ktts; sending the text to & ktts; send the speaker line with speaker line filters can overwrite the chosen speaker.</seg>

<seg id="2654">To achieve a faster finish, you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string, i.e., start the regular expression with &lt;! [CDATA [^]] &gt;.</seg>
<seg id="2655">Place here the properties of the desired filters. if the text displayed the above filter conditions, the speaker will be selected, which matches the desired requirements. click on the button on the right to view the dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Use these buttons to store or load your speaker settings, or to delete all settings.</seg>

<seg id="2679">To compile & ktts; you need a current development environment of KDE (version 3.4 or new) including the packages of kdelibs and the development files for the program "Speech-dispatcher."</seg>
<seg id="2680">If you have the source code of & ktts; from the source archive for kdeers, or downloaded the program here, you have downloaded and install the program with the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2681">Before you & ktts; use, check first if Speech dispatcher is working correctly with your voice synthesizer. for this you can use the Shellscript SPD conf.</seg>
<seg id="2682">& ktts; in & KDE; 4.4 is the first version of & ktts; the program kttmsgr should be developed so further that the establishment of Speech dispatcher is directly possible and the SDP conf file is no longer needed.</seg>

<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is a W3C standard to highlight text for a voice output. this standard includes brands for control of voices, the volume speed, the volume, sex voice and pitch. also marks for control of the pronunciation of e.g. abbreviations. SSML is a part of the VoiceXML specification, another W3C standard.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently supported & ktts; SSML only partially and only in the basic functions. the following restrictions are present:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You need to install the Rab _ diphone voice (British male) because this is the default voice that is used at the SSML output.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If the settings for speed or pitch is not mounted on 100nbsp;% is usually spoken, SSML text is usually very monotonous.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filter and typing filters (SDSs). SBDs may start using text in individual sentences. therefore, you can also read or stop the entire text order. thus, you can also stop or stop on the map card orders, even if the voice synthesizer this does not directly support.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you can see the proposibility filter filter. at the first start of & ktts; is automatically set up a propositional filter filter automatically. you can change its settings or add other propositional filters, beginners will not get out of it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">On the easiest way you can learn the setting of the speaker selection, choose the speaker option and select text to read. check out the speaker ticket orders, which speaker & ktts; choose the speaker option again, change some properties and check how the selection of the speakers have changed, otherwise you need to have more than one speaker, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktts; then start with the pre-read, as only the first sentence must be processed and not the whole text block, which can last very long,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can stop text assignments then on the map card or cancel, even if the voice synthesizer this function does not support.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons the normal typing limiter filter is automatically set up, if you start-tsmgr for the first time. it cannot be switched off, just remove. change anything about this filter, unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Typing filters compare text with a regular expression for propositional and add a tablature sign (decimal code 8) at the typing borders (decimal code) (decimal code) automatically removed from the text). note that the default limiter filter filter is attached the drawing.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters will never be applied to & KDE; News (killer), warnings, messages or the output of screen-refunds.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed from understanding the normal typing filters, you can insert this once again by loading the file standard _ sbdrc.</seg>
<seg id="2736">On the map card, you can write the speaker settings for the application. the map card is displayed when</seg>
<seg id="2737">Use of the standard speaker (the top one on the cartels speaker). in other words, there are no speaker properties.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Use of the most appropriate speaker, which shows all the properties of a furnished speaker. if you do not delete or edit the settings of the speaker, chooses & ktts; this speaker. otherwise, chooses & ktts; the speaker from who most sought after the original features.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method to enter the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select the properties of the desired microphone. if this property does not play a role, do not give anything else.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Select this landing field when the property is to have precedence over other properties. you can also set several markers here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor in understanding the output, it is always treated as a priority feature. you will use this property rarely. the only case where you may wish to specify the attribute language, is ahead if you know that a certain application text is sent in a different language than that in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all properties in the range of speaker, who corresponds to the following corresponds to the button default, click on the selection button and then use the speaker, which corresponds to the following.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case it is 0 for the last text order in queue. you can also specify a order number (no order number is required input 0).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Kttsmgr crashes immediately when it is started. I have debug support support but I don't get any backtracking.</seg>
<seg id="2746">GStreamer is crashed and & ktts; probably you have to register Gap-register-0.8. if the issue is not solved by Gap-register-0.8. if the problem is not resolved, it is possibly a non-compatible version of Gstreamer. you can try to update or uninstall Gstreamer.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The audio output about ALSA does not work when I play with another application music at the same time. if I stop a text message, freezes & ktts; a message appears on the & console; appears a message that said to open PCM.</seg>
<seg id="2748">On your system there is a problem that conflicts with ALSA can occur that prevent a simultaneous opening of multiple PCM devices. notes for possible solutions can be found on the website of the ALSA project (dmix) www.alsa-project.org.</seg>

<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; allows the user to manage a range of system and desktop settings for a uniform, integrated surface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be accessed by selecting K Menu kcontrolcenter; be called..</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; package was developed to enable users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & knetworkstation; create a simple surface for the user:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation, a new module network settings in & kcontrolcenter is displayed. the module network settings (knetworkconf;) can be started by selecting a kcontrolcenter; Internet & Network network settings in & kmenu.</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkconf; network hardware cannot install. physical devices and their drivers must already be functional and configured to allow & knetworkconf: the device at all indicates and the setting of network features enables.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed by installing & Linux; with installed and furnished, network devices are added later, the drivers must be loaded through adjusting the following files, according to the kernel version.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The module network settings will be loaded when the network settings in the & kcontrolcenter; -index is selected. at the starting of the module network settings, this, the platform used on the system automatically detect.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform can not be detected, the hanging choice is offered. it is the platform from the list to select the distribution and the releasers at the best. by selecting the setting non-again queries, the definition can be made permanently. at the next start of the network settings then this selection will be automatically preset.</seg>
<seg id="2806">The change of network settings is possible only in system administration mode. previously all options are displayed, what means, the settings can only be viewed. in the system administration mode, you will be able to change the system administration mode at the right bottom of the module. it is necessary to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In the system administration mode, the entire functionality of the module is available. it is divided into three tabs:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The tab network interfaces for the management of the network equipment of the system. all available network devices are shown. from the tab network interfaces can be performed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The configurable network interfaces can be set by selecting the desired device in the list and click of the button and click the button in the dialog device.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. click on the button and displays the dialog with further options.</seg>
<seg id="2811">With the selection Automatically, the TCP / IP settings are fetched by a DHCP server or BOOTP server. the DHCPD or BOOTP server sends out all required TCP / IP address. therefore, no further adjustment is required. in the selection list, either DHCP or BOOTP can be selected according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">With the selection Manual may be made without DHCP or BOOTP the TCP / IP address. in the input field IP address, the desired TCP / IP address must be specified. in the input field network mask is to set the sub-network.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is marked, the system initiates the network interface when boats. if the initialization is not desirable, this option should not be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values entered in this dialog are displayed as the properties of the device in the device list.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used. entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. with ping in the & console; you can determine whether the desired address is already in use. in doubt the network administrator must be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be activated or switched off, depending on your needs, and on the activated network, it is done by selecting the list and clicking the interface.</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network devices can be activated or switched off, depending on your needs. turn on a activated network place by selecting from the list and clicking the interface.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Sets the IP address of the computer in the local subnet, which conveys the physical connection to remote networks and is used as standard for TCP / IP communication with computers in other subnetworks.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If available on computer more than one network interface, the interface must be selected to the net in which the gateway computer is to be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A computer with DNS support replaces a full domain name by the corresponding IP address. this is necessary because computers can only address IP addresses. if the computer http: / / www.einedomain.org does not resolve this name to an IP address like 123,45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The computer for attribution-up part of the equator tag allows easy management of this list. entries may be added, removed or modified wer.DNS entries can be ordered by selecting an entry and up or downgradation in the list with buttons, or set up in the top priority.</seg>
<seg id="2822">By clicking the button of the button, adding a DNS server can be added to a DNS server. it will add the New Namerver dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First, you must enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button. the entry will then be inserted in the list.</seg>

<seg id="2825">The list of the well-known calculators describes the name-to-IP address for the TCP / IP subsystem. it is primarily used for boats when no DNS server is available. in small, interconnected networks can replace it a DNS server.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Normally, the list contains more known calculators, some entries, the & apos; localhostapos; and some special IPv6 addresses support. this is still in the test to replace the version of IP should be replaced in the future version 4.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the well-known computer and click Add.... The dialog of New Alias will be displayed.</seg>

<seg id="2830">It can be one of the following tasks to run, then by clicking OK the list of static hosts is updated.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings made in the module settings are not immediately available in the system. to enable the changes, must be set in a & console; the following command must be set.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The homepage of & knetworkconf; is http: / / knetwork.sourceforge.net you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For the installation of binary distributions (mostly rpm packages) it is enough if they are installed and Qt installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users. it is simply the rpm package to download and install in one & console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool can be used with a graphical surface like a package or the installation tool of their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">For this case the installation of Qt and & KDE; not, but additionally, the development packages with libraries and other things are required.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This will only be recommended by experienced users. however, it is not difficult, & knetworkconf: to compile the following commands should do this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information on basic network technology will be given, in the second all are discussed by & knetworkconf; changing configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This area may not replace further knowledge of IP networks. in this appendix only basic information on the integration of the PC is conveyed into a small (home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Currently, IP networks run with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4) has never found large distribution. by IPv6 is expected that it continues in the near future. this description focuses on the widespread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is to assign the IP address of a network interface. in alien networks, on & eg; workplace is the network administrator the contact point, which is a valid IP address or if available, DHCP can not be chosen as desired.</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up a separate small (home) network, the IP address should be selected from a special request for this purpose to avoid IP address conflict with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded to the Internet, so their arbitrary use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the internet for such machines can be made by setting up a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks are mostly addresses in the area of 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. the area is large for networks up to 250 computers large enough.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually placed on 255.255.255.0, so that all machines are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the Zweite the loopback address (localhost = your own computer). the default route is required for IP forwarding.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The netaddress 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP-traffic in the local own machine. normally the address is assigned to 127.0.0.1 of its own so called loopback interface, which works as a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">This part is the configuration files that are affected by & knetworkconf: and where they are stored in the different distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes dynamically changed at DSL connections, so that it will not be surprised if in the case of active DSL connections, another content is defined as set there.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE; is known that this file is not sorted by the scripts in SuSEconfig. another stand as expected can therefore occur.</seg>

<seg id="2914">If you have confirmed the settings for verification, the dialog will be examined. this dialog displays the progress of the inspection process as well as data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can manage the restore, the files that are to be restored, marked. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives, which belong to the entry for the belt running. it is restored only the selected file or subfolders.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the desired files from one of the archives with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Click with the right mouse button on a file or folder in one of the archives and select in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the recovery process was started, the dialog settings for recovery. in this dialog you can once again check your selection and change the desktop folder.</seg>
<seg id="2920">When you have confirmed the settings for recovery, the dialog will appear re-establish. this dialog displays the progress of the recovery process as well as data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it proves to be necessary to create the bandindexfile using the belt content. this process deletes all existing index files for this band. you can regenerate the index on two types of tape:</seg>
<seg id="2922">Here, a backup profile with the straight selected files and the default settings are created. you can make a backup profile the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working folder in which the backup should be done. the list of securing files is automatically updated according to the selected working folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all the files that are listed under backup files, the files that are stored on the same file system, such as the folder. folders located on other filesystem, you can do separately under backup files. each entry is considered independently of the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform a incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. it will only be saved files that have changed since then.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file that is used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file before the call of tar. this causes that all files are backed up and a new snapshot file is laid out for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of buttons files & gt; and lt; files was not completely implemented at the time of creating these documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">The settings can set you up via the menu item KDat... in the menu settings. the following settings can be made:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to device file (normally / dev / Tape). this path must refer to the non-recurve version of the belt.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If this setting is active, transmits & keless; before the band is involved the command load load to the drive. on some drives this is necessary to be performed before reading or spelling operations.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is switched on, tempting & keless; it does not work on the belt drive. possibly this setting does not work with all bandpower drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is switched on, is discarded with the loosening of the integration of & soldier; automatically the band is discarded. use this option not at floppy disk.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is switched on, tempted & killer; the harddisks size for the belt drive to change. not all drives support variable blockages. no matter whether this setting is active or not, you must notify & glue; in any case the log size for your bandage will communicate.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If a band formed; a band formatted it writes a file to the beginning of the banker. this file should only occupy a memory block on the tape. the content of the file is composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n Byte) The band ID. the format of this string is user name: seconds, whereby the name of the full name of the system is, on which the tape was formatted. seconds is the number of seconds passed since the epoch in which the band is formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $HOME / .kah.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The rest of the files on the tape are pure tar archive which can be managed directly with & GNU; - tar do not function. even other tar versions should work, as long as it is not about incremental backups.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the contents of a backup database. this symbol is only active if a band is involved.</seg>
<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; is a & KDE; -viewer for system protocols. the program is suitable for inexperienced users where you can get information about your system or where the system provides the different protocol files. furthermore, & ksystemlog; experienced users allow quick access to information on issues that occur on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users understand what your computer makes in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who can not know where you can get information about your system or where the system sets the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & ksystemlog; experienced users give quick access to information about problems that occur on their server. & ksystemlog; therefore, some advanced functions will provide, with which help the protocol files of certain programs can be filtered and evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 has a series of useful functions. these include among others:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of protocols, for the format of the syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the other chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you see in the following screenshot, & ksystemlog; functions are available, with which help the single protocol line protocol can be easily filtered and sorting. the individual possibilities for sorting and filters are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start, & ksystemlog; first the most important protocol-file of the system - to open the system protocol. you will not see it, and it opens instead of its small news window, so you have & ksystemlog; very likely not with system walkright. the protocol files are usually found in the folder / var / log, for normal users usually no permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter by selected criterion or according to the filter chains. the list of the log lines is now automatically modified. in the default setting, the selection box will be displayed in addition to the filter. in the default setting, a protocol line contains only displayed when in one of the columns you see the string of the filter concept.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can of course select another entry at this point. select the string process for example, and then enter the name of a process, and then enter the name of a process, so you will show you & ksystemlog; all protocol lines are sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in default setting and helps you to detect the key protocol lines. protocol lines of the level error will be shown with a showy color as a protocol lines of the stage note. the colored display of protocol lines can be duplicated dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you just want to display a specific process (e.g. in the system protocol or in cron protocol), so you can preview the process identification (PID) in the column process. this can for example be useful when you want to investigate the output of a specified command, such as to the start of the samba server. in this case, you use the filter toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can activate the option Add to new lines in the context menu of the main window to display all new added protocol lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows you to use multiple protocol files in separate subwindows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional subwindows. once you select a subwindow, select a protocol for viewing.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. Dort you will find further information about the sources of sources of & ksystemlog;</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; also in the following the folder of the & KDE; Subversion archiving: ksystemlog; in & KDE; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to the & KDE; System V init Editor, rather known (and in the following also named) as & ksysv; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv;</seg>
<seg id="2957">The System V init quickly develops the standard for controlling the program boot at the peak of the system in the & Linux; world. therefore, because it is easier to use, more powerful and at the same time flexible than the traditional BSD -Init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not continue to go on historical aspects (e.g. because I know nothing about it: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because maybe someone could try to make a machine on System V init, without creating a new installation and reformatting. therefore you need to make sure that the old init was removed from there if there was there one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV init also differs from BSD init that the configuration files are in a subfolder of / etc. this folder is called rc.d Dort you will find rc.sysinit and the following additional folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically you need a script for any system service that you want to start off the system or change to another Runlevel. system services include such things such as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things as setserial, which is only once started. such calls belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be on the one hand beneath / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems do this file, even if there is actually not much use for it. you can also create a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run a bit, what to do with the serial connection.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel looks at different places according to the program init and starts the first to find it.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default Runlevel is in / etc / inittab. you should see in the initial section a line as the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can take a look into the second column and probably determine that the pre-placed Runlevel 3 is. if you want to change it, then you can edit / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. if you have something integrated, then you come to restart the system and execute the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the right scripts? if you want to enter -l in rc3.d, you probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that in this folder you do not find the right files. instead, each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the directory init.d.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How does and stopping init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written so that it is an argument like start and stop. you can actually start this script from hand on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the one K includes, the script will stop with the argument stop. if it includes a S, the script will start with the argument start.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want to set up a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could say & eg; a server Runlevel, which can only run httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc. in addition, I could also have a user Runlevel, which & eg; & kdm;, network & etc; starts.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointer is simple to not say trivial: just drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six Runlevel to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also shift scripts between Runleveln or change the position within a level by moving it elsewhere. this will not only happen if they have an entry in the range of available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries will be moved if you simply drag them into a new range. to simply select them from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert them into the target area -- even if the same entry has previously existed in the target area of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of an item can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently there is no way to restore entries that were thrown in the trash. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the Tabulator button to activate the different working areas (Available system services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection of superficial or below the previous ones.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry into another Runlevel, move it to the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it to the desired Runlevel with inserting (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the number or the name of an item manually, press the button button to switch between different fields. connect the dialog by entering the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the menu require a confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings will be stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. presets will be taken in the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise, they will be saved by & ksysv; changes to the preferences are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with the standard Runleveln, and now the machine starts up-proof new. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO -Prompt linux single and press the input button to start the single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default Runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be right).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services with & ksysv; intended for execution under Runlevel X but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you use & SuSE; or delicately (DLD), then you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the distribution of distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way how system services can be started in these distributions, but is unfortunately not standard. the authors of & ksysv; planning an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you use any other distribution: check if all configuration files are available, which are required from the respective system service (and also whether they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) just finish without message, if their configuration files are not available or false.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The meaning of the & Linux; Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, may even be different from version to version. if you use any other distribution, please send me information about the Runlevel so that this manual may be added.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To begin with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of & kuser;</seg>
<seg id="2991">Once you have made changes, you need to store them. either use the respective icon of the toolbar or the entry save in the menu file.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two card cards, the user and the user list. to edit, select the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry. it appears the dialog user or group properties.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some card cards are only shown if you have enabled advanced system settings. only if you have checked space settings on which you can make individual settings. further card cards will appear where shadow -passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd as are installed in BSD Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The card-map password appears, if shadow -passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd as are installed in BSD -Unices.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This map card only appears if needed and initialized (Quota) is activated and initialized (identifiable on the file quota.user / quota.group on the file system). here, for each user parameters can be changed, whereby the limited number of information in KB are:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be configured individually for each file system. the current file system is selected by means of the file system with space restriction</seg>
<seg id="2997">The map card information informs about the group belonging to the selected user. the standard group, which the user belongs, can be found in the primary group. furthermore the user can become a member in other groups by highlight it in the big field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The dialog properties of the group contains a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select Add from the user menu or group or click on the appropriate adding button of the toolbar. the editing or deletion of the selected users or the selected group is similar.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module you can install the LILO's boot menu, remove the boot menu, remove the time up to the boats of the standard operating system, remove the standard operating system, remove, change, change and add more.</seg>
