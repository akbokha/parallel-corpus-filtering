although I visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extremely great .
as many of my generation I grew up with American films , I d@@ anced with American music , read American authors and operated his sport .
in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly due to an American film journalist .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , like he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , a terrible re@@ porter , who covered the mur@@ der@@ cal conspir@@ acy of a oil magnet that the Supreme Court of Jud@@ gment with judges , who wanted to incl@@ ined his interest .
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; free to Meth@@ od Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as if the absolute truth is , forget everything else , that is what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona , had only strengthened my admir@@ ation for the USA .
I said , &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose variety is so inviting you can always be that you are and it is easy to find acceptance within a community of like @-@ minded people .
I even had a very warm welcome letter about his size .
then Donald Tru@@ mp came .
much was written about xen@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
the most exceptional aspect of his ascension is for me , how he re@@ moves with his bott@@ len@@ tic@@ ness .
he never stops behind the mountain , how to say so beautiful .
he says exactly what he expressed as a former colleague express it , and explains publicly his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , African American and women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless people have responded to his statements and cons@@ ented to him for him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 13 million votes , which he won in the Republi@@ can presidential elections , was the highest number one of the party nom@@ inations ever achieved .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support these big@@ otte person , I asked myself ?
I could not bring tru@@ mp and his voters to get into harmony with the people I met during my time in Phoenix .
as for example my Professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , Director of the Journ@@ alism , the people from all over the world cap@@ turing , a profound human being , with whom I could talk about Islam and his past .
also , Tru@@ mp@@ s world@@ view is not bound by Peter Bh@@ atia , the current editor of the &quot; Cinc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ atia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours doing the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
Tru@@ mp@@ s intolerance also stands in contrast to gener@@ osity that I lived at Sandy B@@ ahr , fighting for their lives the environment , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me as their son .
still she fits to the engagement of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es which always helped me with a lot of patience and grace to me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life .
then Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise council helped me a lot with my career .
these people and the ones affected by them greatly deep@@ ened my love of America .
while Tru@@ mp &apos;s going on his way to nom@@ inee Republi@@ can presidential data , they offered me a grip and the counter@@ part to his limited vision of America .
however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
on 8 November 2016 , over 50 million Americans , mostly White , the presidency of a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people .
the confrontation with the idea that people have voted for Tru@@ mp because they were either shared with racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism or because they were prepared to over@@ looked these things , I broke almost the heart .
perhaps it is unfair to design@@ ate the Tru@@ mp voters as r@@ aci@@ sts .
to arrange the people said one of my friends , is exactly what has led to this situation .
this is superf@@ icial and respectful and indicates an in@@ ability to understand those who act in a different way and think .
it shows the people that their worries and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not considered .
could it be that these voters , of which most white are voted for Tru@@ mp because they want to reg@@ ain control over a country that she has disappointed ?
in other words , they might want to say that they are still important in this America ?
maybe .
however , you can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who considers the cru@@ el decision to raise a man who look down with cont@@ emp@@ t on those who look differently from it .
this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( An@@ m ) . : as much as &quot; ten@@ dence of the wh@@ ites against all other Eth@@ ni@@ cities &quot; ; vocabulary from white in bac@@ kl@@ ash on the wh@@ ites and whi@@ pl@@ ash as it was the great Van Jones , did exactly what America has made so great .
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - which faith or background one may still have , America means everyone .
for this land chose as its President , twice the son of a K@@ eni@@ ans whose history , as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible .
but with the election of Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s , however , is a huge part of the white America that promises this promise , saying , To Hell with multiple , religious freedom and the whole concept of plur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is again at the ruin , say it .
with all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a manifestation for Hill@@ ary Clinton Mr. Khan had a vocabulary with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp , would have been my son , captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; I asked Mr. Khan .
the crowd answered with a vo@@ strong &quot; No ! &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bro@@ ods the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; have Lat@@ inos a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; answering them .
have A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they called her and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if any one , who is not like you , a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he received an atmospheric and loud strong &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; NE@@ IN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Khan joined the words : &quot; God is thanks to Mr. Tru@@ mp , that is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the land , for which his son was fallen , sent him a message .
this is now Tru@@ mp@@ s Country , the message said .
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could no longer find a place in this new America .
and that breaks me my heart .

from misery to the stars : these Latin American children cannot spoil their love for music through rub@@ b@@ ish
the &quot; Recycling Instruments &quot; of C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay , while a concert in Washington DC .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ean town C@@ ate@@ ura together ?
that the music , which is played at both places not only changed the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large gar@@ bage dump , just 16 Kilom@@ eters south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial city that is very popular among the tourists - but worlds from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world famous cuisine .
for several years now the La B@@ anda de M@@ Ãº@@ sica ( musi@@ ban@@ de ) has been playing in the municipality : one from children and adults existing sym@@ ph@@ ony orchest@@ ras , which has found their musical instruments an opportunity to overcome them surrounding poverty .
a music school with 100 students has become the central interest for the municipality of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the municipality , which is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mex@@ ic@@ os , is known for its drugs abuse and ban@@ den violence .
but this changed after a random encounter with a French pil@@ ots who started a musical project and gave the youth so a rare hop@@ eless@@ ness .
the young band members take their obligations to the music group very seriously , says the local press No@@ tici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
once they come from school , they walk back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
you always come and play with shiny eyes and play in the Tru@@ bel , you learn day for day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , Pic@@ colo , clarinet , O@@ bo@@ e , flute , forest , Bon@@ go and the Con@@ ga to play .
music from trash
more than 7@@ ,000 km south of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village that is practically at the top of the largest gar@@ bage dump of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments that are produced from recur@@ ring waste material :
music with re @-@ prepared instruments that consist of local solid waste materials , manufactured in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recycling under direction of F@@ avi@@ o ChÃ¡vez began to turn parts of the waste in instruments .
the instruments im@@ i@@ est violin , viol@@ as , cello , bass , guit@@ ars , sax@@ oph@@ ones , tro@@ mb@@ ones , tro@@ mb@@ ones and percussion that were all made out of the trash .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra etc .
in an article from the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o ChÃ¡vez , a local ec@@ ologist and musician teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura at the initial time :
first it was very difficult , because we had no room for rehear@@ sals , and we had to teach at the same place where parents worked in the trash . children don &apos;t know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live with their children .
this changed as F@@ avi@@ o something that he had never seen before : one out of waste produced violin .
today there is a whole orchestra which plays based on instruments from re@@ prepared material and called The Recycling Orchestra .
a documentation called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic gar@@ bage dump ) features the musical performance :
the world generates around one billion tons of trash every year .
those who live with him and from him are the poorest people - like the people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn him into something beautiful .
land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspir@@ ational spectacle from trash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the Orchestra has even played his music in front of Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and teamwork can successfully fight against illegal fishing
photo Â© F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports international , practical solutions for environmental problems .
the re@@ publication takes place within an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for sharing content .
in West Africa , at that time it was known that this ship had already operated in li@@ o@@ lic waters illegal fishing . before it was looking for the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were therefore seized and little incl@@ ined to welcome a legislative fr@@ at@@ cher of this kind at its coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the compres@@ s@@ ors , Moz@@ ambi@@ que and the Seychelles was rapidly opposed to the ship . they linger for him , one of their har@@ b@@ ors and refuse to give him a fisher@@ man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that you simply spend everything to stay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a leading provider of the Ken@@ yan fishing authority . he is part of a team that discovered and followed the ship . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : it was not able to catch the fish there .
eventually , it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liber@@ ia because of pl@@ under@@ ing the fish stocks of the country .
the core of this initiative , which protects criminal practices and protects resources , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the NR@@ O Stop illegal F@@ ishing ( Il@@ legal Fish@@ eries ) .
the members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar the six countries , which at that time had driven the prime minister from their waters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and working together . they exchange information and are mutually exclusive where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts Project En@@ ding illeg@@ ally F@@ ishing . this project offers F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , absent because it is extremely difficult to track down , that illegal fishing is a leading cause of the over@@ fishing of regions .
due to the obvious dis@@ cont@@ emp@@ t of existing laws , by which certain habitats and species are to be protected , the illegal fishing ecosystems can harm that have a delicate equilibrium .
however , while actions against illegal fishing was once protected by bureaucratic hur@@ dle and also by the sn@@ ail , with the information between individual countries , so the actions occur nowadays in real time , with trac@@ eable at F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there , the individual countries can share with each other for example lists existing licenses , news on susp@@ ects activities or details that you have noticed or experienced during a port in@@ spec@@ tor .
Fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very attentive when they move on the open seas by means of satellite data .
this makes it possible to mark the authorities , ships that fish in Forbidden areas . also , so susp@@ ects drive routes - some such that suggest that a ship loads his shot fish on the way on other ships .
in the ideal case , such investigations can indicate whether the participating ships have a fishing license , where they were traveling and perhaps also whether they have a criminal .
countries which are against illegal fishing , can be found on the basis of such information then the adoption of such ships in their ports . what means that the ships could not sell their charge . and that they can even be forced to pay criminal off@@ ences , as in the case of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then there is significant financial losses for the owner , which means that the illegal fishing catch is financially no longer worth it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that &apos;s what we want to achieve , &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , director Director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consultant company that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i .
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to win estimated 20 million USD in lost sales , which under@@ mines the eight members of the network H@@ IS@@ H @-@ i every year because of illegal fishermen , which penetrate into East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fishermen that attracts the region of commercial fishing from all over the world . among these also illegal fishermen .
these practices include actions such as sailing under false flag , counterf@@ eit license papers , indicating f@@ anta@@ sies , the fish @-@ protected species and fishing in nature conservation areas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they target@@ ing the lack of international co @-@ operation and make the weaknesses of a not complete organized control system &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier a ship could illegal fishing and a country could then say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you dar@@ ker to walk my harbour . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but another country could say &quot; Come to me &quot; . &quot; and just this leg@@ ale lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i .
so far the closed front works .
since its foundation F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i has participated in more than 30 studies of susp@@ ects ships .
it has criminal networks un@@ covered , distributed counterf@@ eit licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has followed ru@@ gged ships tr@@ acked and found .
because of its cooperation with Inter@@ pol , the international authority to fight crime , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing over large distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organized crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he builds a system which should help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i , susp@@ ects ships conc@@ ise .

Fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is always developed , helps also to convert the illegal ships that likes to hide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide its activities and its position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , boss analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ g@@ g M@@ at Tracking , an NGO , which also deals with fishing data and F@@ IS@@ H technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships will turn off their automatic identification systems , which they can no longer be Georgian by satellite .
Cop@@ eland therefore helps to build a system that connects different information levels together . it should help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to find crimin@@ als with larger precision .
a model program
but F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations can actually influence the undoubtedly global issue of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the NR@@ O Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened together with Google and the marine protection organisation Oce@@ ana , the platform Global F@@ ishing Watch : a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed worldwide by means of the position of each trac@@ eable ship worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the neighbours to get a better picture of what is doing - that is simply sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources for investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable tru@@ sts has a similar project to run where a global system allows the persecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s activities not only felt crime , but they are also deter@@ red .
ships that have been conf@@ is@@ cated in the past without a license and barely had consequences of consequences , now they know that they are observed .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i participated in the meantime a 33 % increase in fishing sales , since fishing boats to buy more licenses .
after F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Somalia helped , Gre@@ ko 1 asc@@ ended , the inspec@@ tors found there on board tow , whose use is prohibited .
photo with friendly permission of F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries will notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that now also other countries do copy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa several hundred million dollars will disappear by illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are six countries gathered in 2015 , to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they now fight illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model as F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with certainty , the aim is to create even more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s youngest member country will report his first big triumph : in October it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was under false flag . and not only was the ship used without a license and have been used tow@@ ing networks , which are now prohibited .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship was also penet@@ rated also in Forbidden waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the take of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , the strong sign that it is against illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time evidence that such special , collaborative approach to protect the oceans actually works throughout the world sea . Emma Br@@ yce is a freelance journalist and lives in London . there she writes on the subject environment , technology and nutrition .

the street movements in Venezuela seems to be just the beginning of a wave of severe demonstrations .
they are regarded as protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum on the Government of Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro .

under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ de@@ Venezuela ( e.g. : the return of Venezuela ) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them .
the debate is also conducted in other parts of the country - among other things in the flat region of Bar@@ inas , in the Andes @-@ regions of MÃ©@@ rida and T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira , in central @-@ north @-@ eastern Bundest@@ a@@ at Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the political and economic situation of the country deteri@@ or@@ ated continuously what is noticeable in the everyday life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans through a acute lack of food and medicine .
many representatives of the opposition have seen in the ministers of the current president Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro , the chance of a fundamental change ; but ultimately , the ab@@ duction of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ Ã­@@ az , co @-@ acting with Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ ising in their latest article on the context of the Government .
within the framework of social , political and economic crisis , in which the inflation and spices are among the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % to the annual financial statements ) and in which a grave and widespread lack of food and medicine was considered the only way to conquer the country the chance to conquer its institutional structures and to close a new governance .
the electoral sheet of Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ Ã¡@@ tica or short MU@@ D ( about : round table of the Democratic Unit ) , called the demonstr@@ ators for the support of the National Assembly to join forces , which continued to continue after the elections of Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro &apos; . here , the trial against President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro &apos; was planned to continue on November 3rd , should continue to continue the block@@ age of the referendum on 3 November , should continue to continue the block@@ age of the referendum on the term .
the call was commented on Twitter including commented :

on Twitter , pictures that tell about disputes , as well as reports of repression and mis@@ conduct .
especially large waves beat the news about polished oppression in the centrally located city of Marac@@ ay .
there the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local Cathedral to protect themselves according to their own statement from the police and armed advocates of the government .
hours later they were able to leave the cathedral again , but the protests went further .
in other parts of the country they attempted to hold some demonstr@@ ators , the police forces , including those women in the An@@ den@@ um T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira :
the women in T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira do not wear tube because you could see something else what many national gar@@ den@@ sts do not have !
meanwhile , an Info@@ graphic makes the amount of repression per day :
so the dictatorship gave the land oppressed .
many representatives of the government had asked the validity of the claim after a term of ministers - this was now demonstrated in the eyes of many by the presence of innumerable people on the street .
my@@ t@@ ks Media Lab@@ s for this :
Nicol@@ Ã¡s and Di@@ os@@ dado claim that 1 % of the sig@@ natures are counterf@@ eit .
here is your term of term !
on the road !
others consider these protests as another step in the fight against a government , which from their perspective was little against the devastating economic crisis and would rather prefer to leave critical voices .
they took us so much - but also the fear !
the mar@@ ches always take more in frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported the media , they are hungry to participate in a strike , instead of working or buying .

this is an adapted version of an interview of Ale@@ jo GÃ³@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 on D@@ Ã­a a D@@ Ã­a , an Argent@@ ine news page .
the interview was translated into English and published here with friendly permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to watch the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ inian city of CÃ³rdoba .
in the meantime , Qui@@ j@@ ano said now in the context of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process in the province of CÃ³rdoba to his father .
in the process , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were examined , which were committed during the Argent@@ in@@ ean military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
starting at the brush , the same name as his father carry up to the brutal military installations in jail in La Per@@ la , which he observed in the age of 15 , he has suffered enough .
34 years long he kept the secret of secret for himself .
in the situation then I believed that was fine .
I felt like a sal@@ ary .
as a child of 15 years one does not notice that you are manipul@@ ated by his father .
I could not realize that my father was a th@@ ief , Fol@@ terer and mur@@ derer .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ry . during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of State aphor@@ ism , his father from 1976 to 1978 dep@@ uty com@@ mander of secrecy 141 in jail in La Per@@ la .

but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the op@@ pressor , who is charged with ab@@ duction in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and the ab@@ duction of a 10 @-@ year child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ anos son , a man who had experienced over the years the extent of the atro@@ cities that he had experienced as a boy , and who said before a federal court against his own father .
his story shows which great power has a parent with his child and how this child has chosen a way of salvation .
from the sports hall to the military base .
when my father began to take me to the military base , I often went with us into the sports hall . there I was friends with a boy who made martial arts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all made him &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ white photo and asked me to identify my boyfriend .
he said :
you are a hole , you have made you friends with one of the ERP .
pass only on that they will not cause you one day , and I will save you .
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for Ej@@ Ã©r@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ cion@@ ario del Pueb@@ lo , - revolution@@ ists of the people &apos;s military - the military arm of the revolution@@ ists of Argentina .
that is why he offered me to go back to the sports hall . several days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me , I would become secret .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be ok . for so my Father had taken me .
on the military base I had to destroy Pap@@ ers who had heard the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda , books , simply everything .

&apos;@@ dah , the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la - all in 1976 .
during the first and last time he left me at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time he commanded to go out . he led me to a bar@@ ac@@ ke , in the cars , furniture , TV , refriger@@ ators - simply everything possible .
all of this was stolen .
he gave me a little into a ceiling and commanded to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big cl@@ ump of silver .
on that day I went to the other end of Bar@@ ac@@ ke where the stolen items were completed and signed me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
there , the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
I pointed out and saw a lawn where people were tor@@ tured .
she looked like a dirt bed and metal springs .
later I found out that they fortified that one end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was just captiv@@ ated there .
they rarely get a man with hand@@ lers to the bed , poured out it with water and hun@@ ted him a cargo from 220 vol@@ ts to the genit@@ als .

the stu@@ ff@@ ank there was dra@@ in ... like a dirty wind .
years later , when my father stood under house arrest , the same smell came from his room .
I realized the smell instantly and me became clear that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a human being can do so much suffering from another so much ?
&apos;@@ I knew that these people were killed .
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were captiv@@ ated with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and carried away .
he talked to &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ Ã³@@ pez , a civilians who was also charged in the trial ) and I used the opportunity to take a look at La cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background I saw a number of mattresses on which naked people were numbered with the face down - all were captiv@@ ated by hands and feet .
in the vicinity of the entrance led people quietly on the mattresses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my Father noted that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What gu@@ est thou so , Ar@@ sch@@ loch ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I did &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why have you otherwise brought me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were cast into a pit and killed by soldiers and buried .
I know that , because my father told me at home .
beside La cu@@ ad@@ ra were some rooms that were referred to as offices .
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero came together a man and sle@@ w a man .
( according to indications of survivors the Jor@@ ge Rom@@ ero , who was also charged in the La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process , the students Ra@@ Ãº@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) .
in the following video Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , Head of the memorial La Per@@ la , by the former fol@@ ter@@ chambers .
the way on which you came here , is also the way on which the kidn@@ apped came here .
when you look at the map , see that they took about this route and then were tor@@ tured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they received a number assigned as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization .
when they survived torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the arrangement from above came that they should be reloc@@ ated .
this was the lie - the Eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the awakening of men and the disappearance of their corp@@ ses in most cases .
the &apos; War of War &apos;
my father brought all kinds of stolen things home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; back then at the age I had no idea what the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war @-@ mare &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - as they called it - was . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but when I was later on the military - I was in the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie - it was clear to me that war @-@ mare was a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military @-@ marks that one has fought one enemy .

but if you go into a house and the fridge , the record player , clothing , paintings , money ... ste@@ als , then it is not a war of war but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I have always wondered how my Father , the leader of security forces , in this v@@ and@@ alism could take part .
I just understand it .
I was also officer of the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter into a house and ste@@ al everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my Father could do that .
once he called me a crime and I answered , and thou that thou shou@@ ld@@ est get cars on the road ?
you are not a crime ?
he explo@@ ded in front of anger , struck me and cried :
if you go so far , then I will find you and deliver you stand .
for this we need no one else !
so my Father was .
I have no single memory of him .
when I said in the trial , I showed a photo of that time when I carried a jacket and a wheel swe@@ ater from Wol@@ le . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still did clothing with home .
at that time I accused the defense , a co @-@ wor@@ e against this crime . I res@@ ist no problem , they can lay me the burden of what they wanted .
I was anyway there to declare .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dis@@ appearances of the body is the last ab@@ om@@ in@@ ous act &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now , where I am older , I find repentance .
I have children . if you have only children , one recognizes the value of a life .
one develops further and realize that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , you think so during the dictatorship people are ex@@ ek@@ u@@ ated . but what the corp@@ ses disappear ?
why children kidn@@ apped ?
one day my father brought a girl home , whose mother was killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl .
I always asked myself the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
they could have just been put into prison .
I guess it was simply chosen to kill these people . but what their corp@@ ses disappear ?
had these people not too families to pass on their mor@@ tal rem@@ n@@ ants ?
the dis@@ appearances of the body is the last ab@@ om@@ in@@ ous act , which you can do to man .
my Father told me when democracy was introduced again when democracy was restored to eliminate the mor@@ tal rem@@ n@@ ants of the prisoners .
they were sm@@ iled and somewhere escaped - no idea where . &quot; you will never find something , &quot; said my Father .
but something remains of course always .
&apos;@@ I have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
just to make it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 crimin@@ als - including my Father .
the thought to indicate my father , arose during a conversation , when he stood under house arrest .
I made him accus@@ ation because of all the atro@@ cities that I had to experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I have not killed anybody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly in@@ war@@ dly and asked me why the whole over@@ plain patrio@@ tism and the &quot; Western &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; western and Christian feelings &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which they supposedly defended themselves were really good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I cried :
how can you tell me what to tell me ?
I have seen how you killed people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you committed horrible crime and you forced me to participate as a child to participate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he only res@@ ists &quot; Na then &quot; me on . &quot;
exactly what did I do .
in 2010 I refunded the first ad .
I finally recognized that he was a criminal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can imagine that I am taken in . I finally said against my own Father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest , still before the end of the process .
he was indi@@ cted for 4@@ 16 crimes : including severe , un@@ lawful freedom , torture in 154 cases , murder in 98 cases severe cases , torture with subsequent deaths in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping of a under 10 @-@ year child .

the judgments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the size of the judgment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after four years , in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses have been heard , the historic La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process ended due to the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 crimes against 7@@ 16 victims in August .
43 op@@ press@@ ors were found guilty of crimes against humanity . the judgment was found guilty for crimes against humanity , and in nine cases ti@@ cl@@ esi@@ ans between 2 and 14 years . in six cases there were free test .
eleven of originally 54 def@@ endants died during the process .

all the def@@ endants were during the dictatorship members of the military , including former military members , former police and civil employees .
Piero De Monti was kidn@@ apped together with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he set the following words to the exhau@@ sting chamber :

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court part of the court is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations who have worked for victims for years on justice for the victims . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; a translation error makes older people in Kyoto to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; awesome car drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can extend its leadership , last month , witnesses of a very special translation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on a shield , the Japanese word can be trac@@ ed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the older auto@@ graphs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means - maybe but also translated with BÃ¶@@ ll backgrounds &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; awesome mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the false translation was from 1 to 20 September to electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself .
edited the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was often shared in social media .
the error was the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident Ky@@ otos . he was it also , who made the local newspapers attentive to it .
the daily Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n wrote in Kyoto :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that nobody has read the translation correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an ins@@ ult for older people and in an international city like Kyoto simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the faul@@ ty English translation was initially removed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) was later replaced by the good , even though gram@@ mati@@ cally not completely correct term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ der &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of the Pre@@ fecture of Kyoto apologi@@ zed for the translation errors . furthermore , they stated that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported as follows on ap@@ ologies :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sincerely hope that older people felt off@@ ended by the insufficient correction ( the translation ) of our part , &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News sat down a bit more detailed with the phenomenon of the &quot; terrible &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; horri@@ bly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was denoun@@ ced as an in@@ appropriate description of older auto@@ graphs . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers , the land@@ es@@ far occurs in accidents , but quite cause for concern . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the pre@@ fecture of Kyoto , for example , 1.@@ 9@@ 41 was caused by a total of 19 460 inci@@ dents of sen@@ iors . this corresponds to a share of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors caused 1.@@ 8@@ 03 from a total of 11.@@ 850 accidents .
in this way , their share rose to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents have fallen in total , the proportion of sen@@ iors caused in@@ inci@@ dents in the same period .
the name not named Re@@ porter brought in the version of the article comments to light that illustrate which prejudi@@ ces some Japanese seemingly seemingly against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo on the translation errors received the following comments :
- &quot; Is this ( &quot; terrible drivers &quot; ) about the reality ? &quot;
- &quot; As incorrect is the translation actually not , or ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t find that that is a true translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so common in Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a true discovery for these bizarre errors in English .
photo of Flickr users Andrew .
the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold .
to place you need two important skills : passive voice knowledge to understand the output text and to commit active language skills to transfer him into the target language .
the latter demands the active master@@ y of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers in the case . in general , the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the language language - native speakers should be .
so a French language should translate as an example from English to French - not from French into English .
photo of Flickr users Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ workers with English as a mother tongue , which could make translations into English . this may be lacking of understanding of the surplus , cost reasons , or the relatively small number of English native speakers , to learn the Japanese .
some companies that even have no foreign employees , have translations nevertheless left @-@ to @-@ internal . then the Japanese staff will be considered the best to be in translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are .
photo of Flickr users Karl Baron .
automated translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
the distor@@ ted and pu@@ zz@@ ling sentences , which arise by machine translation , show that this technique can not replace a long one human translator . this applies to some languages very special .
some of the strange English wor@@ dings in Japan , including the pu@@ zz@@ ling prints , often used T @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for styl@@ istic reasons - not read or not to be understood .
photo by Flickr users Joseph Br@@ ent .
interpre@@ ting errors do not like to be a jewelry or at least harmless . however , by large companies or by the government who have the funds to guarantee higher standards , we can expect more careful translations .
in the future , the city of Kyoto takes a serious source of its translations into the future .
Venezuela : taking protests and cens@@ ors on the Internet and TV
main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ eg@@ ar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( Free surfing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institute of Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , April 7 , mel@@ ted Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet user , that they could not have access to the online radio station Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay .
later , other users wrote that the internet presence of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ o@@ lio TV will be no longer available .
also other online radio stations over@@ took recordings of the protests in Caracas , which were organized by op@@ position@@ ists who res@@ ist by the government of Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro@@ s .
the protests began in early April after the Supreme Court was dissolved the parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court .
Luis Carlos D@@ Ã­@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a Tr@@ ac@@ er@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was curved , and recommended the users , VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# cens@@ or@@ ship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages of Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are once locked again .
this is from the side of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among vene@@ ers with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media have been hes@@ it@@ ant since 2014 in the reporting of protests . at that time , the Commission was on tele@@ communication to them with money and lock@@ ings if they continue to report on demonstrations as the Commission saw this as a &quot; call to violence . &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels I signed up again at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
amazing that this continues to be cheaper than two liters of le@@ mon@@ ade to buy .
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay is in@@ accessible through a block@@ age of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two more online transm@@ itters . this also affects the Internet site , at which the National Assembly carries its meetings .
previous resear@@ ches of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had sur@@ rendered that the local internet provider will sometimes use DNS . it is a technique that is in@@ compatible with the DNS server requests specified by certain domains .
when a website is blocked by the DNS server , the server is in@@ accurate or denied the request at the call of such a website .
we confirm a DNS server : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ v@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third s@@ per@@ ed channel , the broadcast was stopped on Thursday , April 6th , when the V@@ PI@@ TV camera er@@ aman El@@ vis Flor@@ es , which was over@@ taken the protests in Caracas .
Flor@@ es was be@@ aten while he was in police food .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went back on show .
although some channels are still accessible over YouTube , it was also reported that the government regul@@ ates the Internet connections : so that the Venezu@@ el@@ ans will gain access to multi @-@ media coverage over the current events in the country .
in Paraguay many girls become slaves to get a training
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was as a child a cri@@ adi@@ ta . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today Tina Tina for the rights of children and collects testimonies of other Cri@@ adi@@ tas , which were just as they were victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the shortened version of a report by cures which is published by Global Vo@@ ices with the kind permission of the authors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the article is part of a series titled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ elas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flying cows , random schools &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , edited and re @-@ published by Global Vo@@ ices of Latin America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household where she was not shared with the family who lived there .
shortly before gradu@@ ation at the university she returned to the house again and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about her . she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who have become something &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old , she began to work as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ adi@@ ta , one den@@ otes that more than 4@@ 6,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the business is quite simple : a big family with little money passes her min@@ der@@ age son or her min@@ der@@ age daughter to another , plentiful family . in the exchange , the child receives food , a training and a roof over the head .
what is not mentioned here is that children have to do so innumerable days of house@@ work that will never be paid and sacrifices of abuse and abuse - and all this within the scope of a contract which cannot lift up .
this as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go practice is widely used in Paraguay due to involvement and acceptance by large sections of society and in spite of numerous complaints from human rights organizations .
after completing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for some years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ tas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - gathered witness , researched and denoun@@ ced .
she tried to call things in the name , because the feeling of Gr@@ atitude , that is to be vacc@@ inated in general , guaranteed in general breast@@ feeding .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double del@@ usion , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is one hand on the one hand the family that their daughter is able to complete their training , improving their position in society and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something from themselves can &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; to another family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the family stands for the girl in itself and whose exploitation is justified by faith that they would give someone a chance that otherwise no training would be received and maybe even star@@ ving .
the victims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is mis@@ diagnosed , his family will only experience many years later .
sometimes they never learn about it .
in January 2016 , the hitherto relatively un@@ familiar phenomenon , which is held in the bor@@ rowed in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen households , but a face .
as Carolina Mar@@ in in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº in the hospital , her body showed traces of violent blows . shortly afterwards she died .
it was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former Mil@@ itÃ¤@@ ran@@ ger Tom@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as an official representative in the family @-@ resident office .
Mar@@ Ã­n lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ Ã­a , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n .
at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ re@@ ira suggested as long as with a stick to Mar@@ Ã­n until they suffered deadly violations .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
some days later the media reported on the incident .
they stressed that the mur@@ dered child was a cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations like UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made deeply rooted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen society of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go for the death of the girl .
they signed the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; several dozen people came to protest together and called for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no other &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Carolina &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the name of the girl and photos were widely used in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay are more cows than children &quot; compl@@ ained Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
without Pap@@ ers it is much easier to hurt the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control , under what conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbors of the couple and nearly 60 civil society organizations demanded a rapid investigation of the case .
they want that Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was their Cri@@ adi@@ ta to be sentenced to 30 years in prison .
if the case comes before judgment , the case of Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n could be a case for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
the everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
Cri@@ adi@@ tas are not only exploited as labour force , they are also isolated from other girls at their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the farms in which her father worked , bank@@ rupt , and her father lost his work .
their brethren now had to work and began to sell on the road or on the market of sweets to make money .
but they all went further to school .
only Tina has been sent as Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the capital As@@ unci@@ on .
in the house of her employers Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day .
they had to share the time so that you still have time to learn .
she stood up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for their employer .
for example , they puri@@ fied the fridge , p@@ anned the living room , polished the furniture and disinf@@ ect the floor .
when the school was at the end she went home and had time to learn .
the more she finished with learning , the more free time she had .
but also this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she had never had hungry , but I also didn &apos;t get any food . &quot; I was allowed to pick up more books from the library of the landlord as a meal from the fridge , &quot; reminds them .
the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , which was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
at some evenings of the landlord Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , next to him stand and guides from Op@@ position@@ ings as &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; or &quot; El Pueb@@ lo . &quot;
he tried to persu@@ ade them to convince the reports of the official media on the regime of the dict@@ ator .
he kept her for intelligent , but did not hold him with her . &quot; the landlord had found someone who heard , while he spoke about politics , &quot; she says .
&quot; they allowed me not often to visit my family because they were the opinion that I would go there again &quot; bad habits . &quot; thus they said that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a belongs to the Indi@@ genous Group of the Re@@ Ã­ , at home their native language Re@@ Ã­ would speak .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their Lord feared that they had made the education they had enabled to lose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it was totally clear that she got for everything she got from them with their hard work .
also at school Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a discri@@ minated against . &quot; one thing that is almost never spoken , are har@@ ass@@ bing and the ra@@ ils that cri@@ es are exposed to school when they go to school .
because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents , a cri@@ adi@@ ta .
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone to my home . I had no friends house at school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in the time where friend@@ ships develop , I feel particularly clear that I belonged to no group .
the isolation was the worst of everything , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
society cheaper the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 a woman published the following text in a Facebook group in which to share advertisements for cleaning personnel and n@@ anny in Paraguay .
the administrator of the group is PE@@ PA Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a town@@ ship in the district of As@@ unci@@ on .
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a small companion for my little daughter who plays in the morning and in the afternoon with her .
to learn .
please pay for you .

the ad got five &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the village Ã@@ em@@ by wrote that she had been a el@@ eventh girl and gave her telephone number .
another woman who also came from Ã@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the third comment by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the inland , I want to work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the fi@@ bers turned into the ad once again :
dear friends , I have found a lot . I look if it works with her .
thank you , I write again if something is .
the business was complete .
in the pro@@ log to the report Cri@@ adi@@ tas , Susanne H@@ ast@@ a cu@@ Ã¡n@@ do ?
( Cri@@ adi@@ ta , how long still ? ) , a collection of testimonies say former Cri@@ adi@@ tas , writes Or@@ note :
in the course of our history we have done it , systems such as slavery , Cu@@ Ã±@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice of the early conqu@@ er@@ ors , the Con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores was subjected ) and the system of Men@@ s@@ Ãº ( where the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors had subjected to tribute to their &quot; wives , &quot; read that many girls and boys go into a system of slavery in which they become light victims of abuse and exploitation .
the social inequality in Paraguay and the vision of power are the key to the understanding of the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
legislation writes Egyptian users social media to register with government

sixty Egyptian parliam@@ ent@@ arians have recently agreed on a bill of legislation on the use of use and utility for social networks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he is approved by the Parliament , users and users need to register social media in Egypt with a governmental authority to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the basis of the law , a place would be set up , which is necessary to use citizens and to use social media .
within six months of acceptance of the law , users and users have to register on the website of the site with their correct names and recruitment numbers to be able to use social networks .
if it fails to do this , that might be a punishment of up to six months in jail or an ATM .
the bill , which consists of six par@@ ag@@ ra@@ ids and divided into local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any application that runs through the Internet and used to communicate with others by means of voice , video channels and text . &quot;
it is unclear how the law is enforced if the draft is not evidence of how Egyptian authorities should not be imposed on the fact that the Egyptian government currently does not register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure regulation on the level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ du@@ l Satt@@ ar , parliam@@ ent@@ ators and Pat@@ rons of the Legisl@@ ative situation , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a username and password by the firewall , blocked Facebook . &quot;
this might mean that Egypt plans to set a Firewall on the national level around Facebook . because of which it would be necessary for the Egyptians and Egyptians to access information about their identity in order to access the network .
but it is not known so far that such plans exist .
experts on site are scep@@ tical regarding the technical fe@@ asi@@ bility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; senior researchers &quot; ) of the Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices .
I feel strong in the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt with regard to things that deal with technology .
in my opinion , they imagine that just as they might be violent to physical public and private spaces , it might be done online .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I take it seriously , it means that they are a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who apply a permit or not . and this means a crazy system to monitor the activities of the people and also to bring them to a court process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is technically no means realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be adopted by the law , the draft must first be discussed in the legis@@ lat@@ ure of the Parliament and the constitutional committees before it goes into plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether its adoption and enforcement will be successful or not , the draft &quot; stands in accordance with a pro @-@ military monument in the parliament , in which sense the control is maxim@@ ised and is to be assured that no devi@@ ating s@@ ails on the image surface is present , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year , the Par@@ ent Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ ha@@ w@@ y proposed a legislative situation against cy@@ ber crime in which a lifel@@ ong prison sentence was intended for those who were found guilty of being the &quot; public order &quot; and to protest &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

high above in the mountains of Kur@@ dist@@ an in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the animal prot@@ ector H@@ ana Ah@@ med R@@ aza and her team of scientists of the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq , to protect the spirit@@ ually Persian leop@@ ards .
a sub@@ species of the larger family of the leop@@ ards covered by Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus Sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . overall , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are due to Wil@@ der@@ ei , loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat , and since they are always less boot@@ y .
why is this particular way of leop@@ ards so important ?
like R@@ aza shows in the video , the Persian Leopard is the only surviving beast in the Kur@@ dish ecosystem , and the health and the prosperity of the ecosystem depends also on that a big pre@@ dat@@ tier exists .
the chance to see a Persian leop@@ ards actually in the wild bo@@ bs@@ led is low and goes against zero . when the team in video therefore makes sure that she &apos;s a recording of a great cat in the camera @-@ all , R@@ aza breaks in pure joy .
as a trained Bi@@ olog@@ in , R@@ aza is passionate about a different side of their country , which consists not only of war and conflict .
it has been involved since six years of field studies on wild animals and educational programmes of Nature Iraq .
it has been a member of IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group and is committed to ensuring that protection zones are set up for wild animals in the Kur@@ dist@@ an region .

at the beginning of March 2017 , the newspaper Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o , the advances that have been achieved over the past six years to rebuild the lives of those who were affected by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thre@@ e@@ fold catastrophe &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a tsun@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima disaster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in S@@ end@@ ai , located in the pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . the pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was a strict pre@@ fecture of Japan in the north @-@ east , which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsun@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and neighbouring prehistoric times Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to disappear , because the tsun@@ ami had all the coastal towns disappear from the map .
in addition , the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima still lived a nuclear accident , already alone had to leave 160 000 inhabitants its houses .
the special report of the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o shows from a local point of view which advances six years later to rebuild the life of the local resident .
the detailed report of the newspaper contains both statistics of Japanese re@@ constructions and survey results of affected people themselves .
the housing situation in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned spare parts ( which was given , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in the Pre@@ f@@ ect Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate were finished .
the biggest success of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i recorded , here 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hima is formed by 70 percent the final light .
however , one always makes every effort to reloc@@ ate six years after the catastrophe , evacu@@ ated by Beh@@ avi@@ d of Beh@@ avi@@ d .
after the triple catastrophe almost 80 000 people saw themselves forced to live in Beh@@ avi@@ d .
in December 2016 still 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate were living in such containers .
nearly 40 percent in 2011 evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima still live in emergency accommodation , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was successful here . over 75 per cent of the evacu@@ ated , which was hau@@ led by the disaster in Beh@@ avi@@ d , were converted into final houses .
for I@@ w@@ ata the number is here at 34 percent .
the state of works and everyday life in the three concerned f@@ ec@@ tures
as the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper was able to establish 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , which were affected by the mis@@ fortune , their p@@ for@@ ten to December 2016 were re @-@ opened , which makes almost 98 per cent of schools of three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , industrial reconstruction is far more difficult in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
while almost 100 percent of the fishing har@@ b@@ ors in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now back in operation , Fu@@ kus@@ hima only 30 per cent of the fisher@@ y har@@ b@@ ors have res@@ umed its operation .
the tsun@@ ami and the atom@@ are accident , moved in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agricultural land large @-@ scale fires .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas , using only 66 percent of the agricultural land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed agricultural land in Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the atomic fact , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed A@@ cker@@ land of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , are located in the &quot; nuclear power zone &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , the tourism expanded again and again , but here Fu@@ kus@@ hima still remains backward .
the tourist figures in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are back to 90 percent on the same stand as before the un@@ happiness . Fu@@ kus@@ hima , on the other hand , can only have 75 percent .
however , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants , it seems more difficult to earn their livel@@ i@@ hoods .
is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
in order to be able to find an overall picture , the newspaper introduced numerous surveys under the local population and among the evacu@@ ated people . they asked them about the state of re@@ building and also how their emp@@ athy against the tsun@@ ami risk has changed .
in their introduction to the article the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper explains :
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o led a survey to bring more about the tsun@@ ami consciousness under the local population .
the survey brought that 8@@ 3.1 per cent of the local inhabitants have taken measures to be prepared for the future earthquake and tsun@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of the respon@@ dents , that still not enough in the cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es of disasters .
as it stands for those who had to evacu@@ ated from the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima
in its output to the anniversary of the earthquake , Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o Zeitung has strengthened its attention to the position of the evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
Fu@@ kus@@ hima not only had to experience the tremendous earthquake and the devastating tsun@@ ami experience , no , the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima was also a witness to the worst , cat@@ astro@@ phen@@ ols , atomic accident , the Japan ever had to experience .
of 160 000 Ev@@ ans from Fu@@ kus@@ hima , nearly 63 000 people were moved into areas outside the pre@@ fecture .
at the beginning of 2016 a little more than 23 000 people came back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima in permanent replacement houses .
after the booth of 2017 there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hima off their home @-@ pre@@ fecture .
in disaster areas most of the evacu@@ ated areas are most of the evacu@@ ated ones who still have to return to Beh@@ avi@@ d , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima with massive building projects . here is building projects , the part of the Olympic Games are to take place in Tokyo .
the world is small : our Pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when people meet other countries that speak a different language , the differences seem to be larger than the similarities .
after a while , one often recognize that one more links than it seems at first glance .
these global connections are important as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces to expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look at exactly these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we deal issues that will often get less attention in reporting than they deserve .
we talk to five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected to someone above language and country borders .
Ver@@ oni@@ ki Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the similarities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ pro@@ asa looks like the love for music has strengthened the lack of common language knowledge during a trip in rural China ; Adriana M@@ aci@@ as talks about time when she worked with people from around the world in London ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences that he collected in a small village in Madagascar .

Brazilian active activ@@ ist in the artificial coma , after having conquered by the police for nationwide demonstrations
left : the attack against Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva . photo : Lu@@ iz da Luz . publication with approval .
right : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva on a widespread photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered this week into the intensive care station : last Friday , a police officers had be@@ aten him during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with a stroke against head . nationwide took millions of prot@@ esters in a protest against austerity .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , who studied social sciences at the Bundes@@ univers@@ itÃ¤t Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s , has suffered a sk@@ ull @-@ stag and several frac@@ tures .
doctors offered him this Saturday and have sent him into an artificial coma .
his condition is regarded as critical .
the local picture of Lu@@ iz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus the spread within a few days rapidly in Brazil .
on the pictures the face of the police officers is also identified with a stroke . the man was identified as August@@ o Samp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police were announced in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s , that Samp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended until completion of the examination of the active service .
the pictures show the police officers , as he suggests the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Luz ) to the face of the students Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Luz ) .
would a police imp@@ aired by a demonstr@@ ator and land on the intensive care station , his face would be six months long on TV and the entire oppression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ ne@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , shared by Lu@@ iz da Luz , shared video on the net , in which one sees , such as Mat@@ eus are attacked by police police and several sanitary blocks briefly to it .
another video filmed with the same scenes , but from a different perspective is also filmed in social networks .
in the shown clip you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state of the state , have been donated to 10,000 Brazi@@ li@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 Euros ) to stay a part of the cost of medical treatment and to stay in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia while being in hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .

on Facebook Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s .
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s has experienced a wave of political force : here the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me Irish has been killed by his father , just to crimin@@ alizing the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . and now we have been attacked the very sad event of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva who has been attacked by a polic@@ eman , having been attacked by a polic@@ eman who has be@@ aten him with a stroke .
police handles
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s was not the only state in Brazil where it came to brutal police officers on the last Friday .
polic@@ emen took place at protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators built a stage for speakers , rubber and Tr@@ ac@@ eng@@ as .
the MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police via loud@@ speaker to reno@@ un@@ ce violence against demonstr@@ ators .
this also includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country .
once again , the Brazilian media is ver@@ ted , by focusing on another , unexpected prot@@ ag@@ onists : a window disk .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported on a distor@@ ted glass window in order to take an illustr@@ ative round of its front pages with a photo .
on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o prefer a title story with a in brand new bus .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason , more than a broken window board than over the protests of thousands of people who serve the defence of a special thing .
this must also be recognized when one is strictly against any form of damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also here the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is an absurd , dis@@ proportionate meaning , and the typical non@@ violence of the military police are displ@@ aced by head@@ lines with the title &quot; demonstr@@ ators on &quot; fron@@ t@@ ational &quot; with the police &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the forgotten villages in Cuba from Ent@@ induc@@ str@@ alization villages in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Ã@@ l@@ var@@ o Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in Cuba closed the doors ( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the People &apos;s Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cub@@ an Province of May@@ abe@@ que is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - well known , regardless of the fact that there is no good sugar @-@ harvest on site .
it is two years ago when the activities were laid down in the sugar cane factories .
after the awakening , the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory lost after and after its installations , until only the smells of steel and concrete remained .
about 2@@ 72 workers had to be re@@ inv@@ ent .
some are rarely the work .
others res@@ or@@ ated and comm@@ utes daily to the factories that even gr@@ ind .
N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an , who stands every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugar cane industry do not smoke his sleep .
he heard that it is in the east of the region of sugar factories that have been in operation after a long time , because they were preserved .
this was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene reminds themselves exactly that in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ i would be preserved the sugar cane factory , but the promise has not been kept .
the su@@ gar@@ s industry already resist@@ ed the pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , the low market prices , the in@@ efficiency , the bad administrative decisions and climate change .
in 2016 the production was 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than 1910 produced quantity .
the message would have been a mo@@ tive for the country a few decades ago , but the bad yield are already no news anymore .
why was the Cub@@ an su@@ gar@@ s ?
the old railway station of the community already saw better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically outdated , and hardly competitive , they were un@@ portable for the country .
the initial idea was to focus on producing the most efficient factories , the annual production objectives amoun@@ ted to 4 million tons .
they left only the factories that can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution to unemployment ?
the motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of the su@@ gar@@ s plant@@ ations and the rise rise in the world market .
nevertheless the sugar price rose from about a decade ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from 2017 until 20@@ 25 the price of un@@ refined sugar between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os will be issued , according to the report published report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; agricultural perspectives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the OECD and FAO , the Economic and Food Organization of the United Nations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3,@@ 6 million tons ) , the pipe export would be approximately 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day with certainty comes to history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was the first words of the Cub@@ an President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the gar@@ be@@ et in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from there , the process of restructuring in sugar industry began .
in the following years , the breast@@ feeding of a total of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further education .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ Ã©e Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto PÃ©@@ rez since 1967 in the factory .
if N@@ ene , as it is known as soldier , about the closure of the factory , the word that he is the most repeated , &quot; fraud . &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents are in the same opinion : not one of them have been informed that the factory was shut down .
in order to get the place they formed a full @-@ time working group .
before the first closing year , the first letters began to come .
it was officially distributed documents , which would only be removed with regard to the parts that would be removed , addressing the addresses and the date .
all were signed by Ul@@ uru Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could dis@@ miss any withdrawal .
from there the responsibility was handed over and the letters were more and more common .
Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for two years for the tac@@ kl@@ ed factory , and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar be@@ et factories .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waiting for retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was against his will at the st@@ agnation of the factory , whose construction he helped .
with every part he remote , dismant@@ led he one of his 31 years of work .
the industry &apos;s best developed industry area has been removed from Cuba and the most important workplace producers .
in many cases , there were no alternatives for working and services that generated the plants in the communities in which they found themselves .
we will never know if during the Mam@@ mut speech of October 21 , 2002 , the then president in the eyes of the present people saw , when he warran@@ ted that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would run well .
the price of the population for the closing of sugar cane factories
since 2004 sugar cane is only slightly extracted through Mah@@ len .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years , the popular community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich , that many things change , but not always for the better , if a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory closed , or better said , they began to pull her off , they also listened to the road to asp@@ hal@@ ted , this also dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms .
without work in the region , and with already advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories .
you have been to spare parts .
without future perspective , too many young people left the region .
in the area a food factory was created , whose production serves not even for the supply of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still imposing .
at the end of 2016 N@@ ene came back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began working .
Ne@@ un@@ und@@ forty Re@@ thia bring the old soldier a R@@ ente of two @-@ out Pes@@ o a month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ i .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man black skin colour , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a tra@@ geous person , yet there are the lies which you told him not .
you have had it for ten years .
N@@ ene is about 65 years in R@@ ente , not because it is lacking in power but because he is bitter .

young people of the First Nations communities in Canada deal with topics that are important for them . they do it by means of Hi@@ p Hop , thanks to a number of walking @-@ workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an @-@ Tour have been offering mobile audio studios directly to schools and youth centers in order to teach youth groups son@@ g@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live recording sessions .
the original workshops were led by educ@@ ators David Ho@@ dges who lives in Montreal and worked in North Que@@ bec with ten C@@ ree communities and then worked together with the C@@ ree Hi@@ p @-@ Hop Group The North@@ Stars .
the workshop is thus rising that the young participants in conversations like &quot; cultural identity , language , debate , love , self @-@ acceptance , &quot; or whatever they always comes to mind .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos , where young people are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team worked with other first Nations communities in the British Columbia province and was invited to organise similar workshops with the tribe of Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ il@@ ak &apos; yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First nation in British Columbia , for example , the story of the Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears &quot; , at which nearly two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or mur@@ dered .
the cases have been largely un@@ solved .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka C@@ ree First nation uses the moti@@ f of a video player to mediate , how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite influences from globalisation .
many of the songs appeared in India @-@ indigenous languages , although the young people do not always master the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i C@@ ree First Nation recorded , the chor@@ us is sung on C@@ ree .
the young people involved here received a little help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from North@@ stars Hi@@ p @-@ Hop Group , who gave them a St@@ rop@@ he in dialect Eastern dialect Eastern James Bay C@@ ree .
on the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ side of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an stands at the St@@ rop@@ he in outlines , as well as a translation into English , which is translated into German here :
sometimes I feel like no one would ever be interested in me
but I try to go on earth further my days
that is the day when you take our cry
because we as youth have lost our path in life
but I believe that we will rise up one day one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
how they can grow and lead to our youth as well
so they can do what they are determined by the creator

in Japan one can see almost every restaurant plastic dishes .
to show potential customers what exactly is standing on the menu , will be displayed close to the entrance sho@@ ku@@ a.@@ pur@@ u ( which was used , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plastic models of dishes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) of each spectacle , which is served in this restaurant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the customers look at these plastic meals and decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is an entire industry dedicated to the production of these plastic meals .
in the to@@ ki@@ osk district K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi there are a variety of these small businesses that produce even those plastic dishes made by the German film@@ makers W@@ im Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese , these plastic meals are so common that they don &apos;t even find them any more . a new trend is turning it today in a show@@ y phone accessories and other gadgets .
at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome published the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos , which show this unusual twist with the sho@@ ku@@ hin San@@ pur@@ u .
now in special sale : new with plastic ch@@ aired mobile phone bands , as they are shown in the Ki@@ chi@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ yu Kauf@@ haus .
many of these artificial foods have turned to kit@@ sch@@ y objects , as in this case , cooling cabinet magnets :
here are a few sho@@ cu@@ es cooling magnets for a new exhibition at Tokyo @-@ Station .
the new boom of ess@@ ences will increasingly become more awake .
in this case , a ka@@ ans @-@ don was turned ( a popular travel bowl with seafood ) into a mobile phone .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a mobile phone .
we also made this part for the exhibition in Tokyo .
and here is an apple that includes your mobile phone :
designed to watch like an apple , with a candle for the mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and that is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the com@@ ic .
some mobile phones and mobile phone designers make your own artwork . in this case i@@ kur@@ a or sal@@ mon is used , a popular t@@ opping which is served with white rice .
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is someone who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now I can do my cell phone with sal@@ mon ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I believe I will probably be the one .
this interest in plastic geri@@ es can also take a less appe@@ tizing shape to surprise for example colleagues or family members unpleasant .
our new mobile phone @-@ stands has the shape of mel@@ ted ice .
in addition , there are also travel balls ( oni@@ gir@@ i ) , ear@@ rings and palms from dry sal@@ mon .
further sc@@ iss@@ ary plastic meals can be found at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # , you are looking for ...
if you would like to know more about the origin of the trends , then this video gives you an insight into the district K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi , who is dedicated to the Bel@@ ie@@ fer@@ ment of the Restaurant industry . such as the sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ u .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic meals are actually produced .
a Mexican project tells the stories of the survivors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the victims of the fight against drug dealers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports in@@ - and foreign media on the in@@ famous &quot; struggle against drug trading &quot; in Mexico , the most mis@@ ses and transmis@@ sions regularly only in statistics . however , these reflect not at all the extent of the human tragedy , which this battle takes place .
the report on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ Ã¡n , the head of the Sin@@ alo@@ a @-@ Kart@@ ell , squee@@ zed the stories of the victims of the conflict perfectly into the background .
on the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks upon the sorrow , or to the churches that have learned to live with the pain .
behind each body , behind every bone report in the hundreds of ge@@ aring tom@@ bs , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never be cure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is why the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico das Digital Project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vivi@@ r C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with drug outlets we learn &quot; ) &quot; &quot; &quot; to give these victims a voice and tells stories of people who put in the struggle between prosecution authorities and cart@@ els . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico describes the project so :
organised crime can not be afraid to fear our lives .
the effects are much deeper .
for example , if businesses close , because they are threatened by drug dealers , and whole communities therefore have to drive many kilometers to buy something like milk .
the pain of the victims
a video with the title &quot; Vi@@ das que cam@@ bian por el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; as fear lives &quot; ) tells exactly these stories .
one main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who searches for every weekend of secret tom@@ bs after his son .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ Ã­@@ guez , who lost their father in just one day , her four sisters , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ew .
&quot; &quot; &quot; priests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves again to the task which we have questioned , go and go to graves after the people we loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 , when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric business in El N@@ aran@@ jo .
on October 13th he left the house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on October 15th he should be back again , but he never came again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very hard for me , because I am now alone with three children who need training . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is also my mother , who is also here with me .
at the moment it has no income .
you stand out the insurance of my Father , but it does not get paid out because that require a ster@@ oid request .
where should we get that ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co , &quot; why the project is so important :
we do not only have to show the faces of those who ask the fear . we must show the international community the conflicts , the frag@@ ility and the state of government .
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high risks .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico , wrote this contribution from Tax@@ co , in the federal state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central m@@ ex@@ ko .
your contribution reminds us that violence should never be considered normal , no matter what type it occurs :
disease and Sens@@ ory journalism , I have already known for some years now .
I &apos;m coming to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the front pages with pictures that actually only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from actors .
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I have the feeling as if I am the only thing that is attached or sad . it affects how a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be in@@ different or see this as normal .
it further writes :
no , it is not normal that my 10 @-@ year cous@@ in thinks that he wants Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) if it is great . and it is also not normal that people listen songs about the &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets .
for me it is as if they were those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that they might have something like that .
I see our weakness if stories led to mere numbers in a statisti@@ c .
the in@@ vari@@ ance of the human being is incredible for me when the death of six people and the nest@@ ing of 43 students in a neigh@@ bor that they were justified . &quot;
I think they try to argue that they remain spar@@ ed by such trage@@ dies , if they do not stir and silent .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the post &quot; four months of press@@ ors in the capital city : how a family with threats has been lo@@ oted . in it , it describes how armed crime month for month money from their business , until it was not only destroyed by the business but also their family apart .
you think of everything you have lost and how some people can change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain is never passing , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes up again when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers also .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the further we are removed , the better .
it included her report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they are kidn@@ apped or kill .
I asked myself in these terrible days if wines would dis@@ solve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to crying . I have to learn to live with the ache .
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ Ã©r@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez : one of the generations drawn generation . &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions on how : who cares for the child of a mixed woman and a man who mur@@ dered by organised crime ?
how is it to grow up in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mex@@ ic@@ os ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents take care of them .
Br@@ yan is a commodity and he tells you had to teach himself how to make a egg coo@@ ks , potatoes br@@ ows , tor@@ tillas warm makes and &apos; Chi@@ chi &apos; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the vial of water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine s@@ cars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for the whole life of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old she said that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood had been over two years earlier than he just saw some blocks from his home , which saw the bloody ser@@ che of his father , which was shot by armed men from a squ@@ ander@@ ing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez saw this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 when violence through organised crime and the struggle against it was mixed with the already existing social problems in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murder according to the citizen of the citizen of public security and the government of the Government of the United States .
in 2010 alone , the prosec@@ utor called 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to the cut 8,@@ 5 Mor@@ den per day .
these are just a few of thousands of hundred thousand stories , which leaves the organised crime in Mexico and penetrate into the soul of the country .
only a few stories are still living in the face of new head@@ lines . but this project is remin@@ is@@ cent of those that we may not forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vivi@@ r C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico 2015 called the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose aim is to portra@@ y the complex information behind the written struggle against drug outlets , which has tor@@ tured the country in the last four decades , in understandable manner .
when a picture is worth a thousand words ,
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; from the Flickr users Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ strÃ¶m &apos;s Wi@@ k@@ strÃ¶m ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) warning : this post and the pages of which he linked are images , which is shown on violence .
the fact check is important in a moment in which it is about to raise a sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding or a for@@ gery .
but how is the year after something the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to continue to pers@@ ist .
let &apos;s take this photo of a terrible accident in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) seven years ago .
since its first publication it was mis@@ leading to advertis@@ ed trage@@ dies which actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false p@@ airing of image and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First D@@ raft News - denied not the fact that there are abundant reporting about events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions concerning our desire for images on messages .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 a gas trol@@ ley wagons the place San@@ ge in the east of the DR Congo , cr@@ ush@@ ed and explo@@ ded . in doing so , 230 people came to life .
after the civil war in Africa , Africa has been neglected and devast@@ ated for years and devast@@ ated . the streets in the region became a dangerous path@@ way full of stro@@ kes , which were difficult to drive .
iron@@ ically , the pet@@ rol @-@ wagons fell victim to the victim .
administrative gu@@ ardi@@ ans described a fire@@ ball , the incub@@ ating homes , including a cinem@@ as nearby , which was full of people that looked at the football championship .
houses twi@@ sted and disgu@@ ised corp@@ ses scattered in the streets scattered .
many people were burnt to the im@@ fession .
a picture with the title &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; from the Im@@ g@@ ur users mysti@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ more photos of the incident form the gray scenes of this day .
above is an example for this .
it shows rows of hol@@ low body that are positioned on the ground while people look at them .
but here the story does not find its end .
over the years , the same photo was en@@ gen@@ dered several times on social media , blogs and other platforms , but cannot be attributed to the related trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened not in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 fighters of the B@@ oko Har@@ am the remote towns of B@@ aga and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
eye @-@ witnesses reported dramatically of atro@@ cities before they had to flee .
houses and stores have been burnt down and corp@@ ses in streets and bushes .
there were reports , according to which 150 up to 2,000 people were mass@@ ac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one stayed back to count corp@@ ses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a citizen to Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many were destroyed , shot or burned .
only on satellite images the subsequent time could be portra@@ yed .
the occasion for the attack was also un@@ solved , but the army prot@@ ection@@ ery in B@@ aga was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ an and trying to win the B@@ oko Har@@ am , country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture from the Democratic Republic of the Congo came again , as evidence of the fact and potential scope of the attack was presented :
this is Nigeria .
a mass@@ acre to 2,000 people took place two days to Paris .
you are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this ab@@ usive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of mis@@ descriptions ; Africa Check has documented assignment of Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases , the picture was taken as a test@@ ament to mass@@ ages .
one step further brings personal comments such as this example , the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to deliver arguments .
the picture from San@@ ge also joined in combination with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a lightning , published by the United Nations , those who were able to flee blows , rape and several dead , some through burning .
while others reported by the violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts , like the following on , which brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture comes from a su@@ ction Arab news page , which was more sus@@ cep@@ tible to the president of My@@ an@@ mar@@ s Th@@ ein , monks and politicians would have participated in the assass@@ ination of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the picture from the DR Congo to show this information .
the original contribution , which was last updated on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news organisations , the AF@@ P as their source , had also pointed out Th@@ ein &apos;s this statement , but had not associated with the image of the DR Congo .
the worldwide reach of false information
traces of these false p@@ ups are going back to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from anywhere in the world .
using a &quot; converted picture search &quot; you can see how far information can be crossed .
a revers@@ ed picture @-@ search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found below 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( stand of 3 May 2017 ) 3@@ 44 pictures , which are very similar to the covered picture from the DR Congo .
they come from a mis@@ ch@@ mas@@ ch private pages , platforms of social media and Community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages like English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have passed wrong reports to inter@@ fere with others tries to dis@@ miss the counterf@@ eit@@ ing .
we have bor@@ dered examples of mis@@ used use and associated with the respective countries , based on which page they have been published . thus , we want to represent the range more clearly than by language alone .
from the countries listed below ( which were connected with one another in some cases ) can be several examples of mis@@ used use .
here are some cases that can now be felt completely repeated ( on the map in Orange ) :
map : News Fr@@ ames .
country examples of false copy of the image from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the or@@ an@@ tic countries point on pages or servers to the examples of counterf@@ eit@@ ing or fal@@ se@@ messages are still available .
the countries in Gray are examples that are according to the metadata and information that are available via Tin@@ Eye , probably also fake examples .
as a memory , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the picture from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( directed at Algeria and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread to the &quot; War of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot;

Canada , 2015 .
this entry design@@ ates a blo@@ gger from Que@@ bec City not only the fal@@ se@@ message , but also discussed the misuse of the image from the DR Congo in connection with Nigeria as well as further questions concerning the intensi@@ fication of the persons and the involved trage@@ dies ( in the DR Congo and beyond ) .
Ecuador , 2013 . &quot; en Nigeria est@@ Ã¡n qu@@ em@@ ando a los Cr@@ isti@@ anos &quot; ( in Nigeria they burn Christians ) .
in this article about explo@@ sions in North @-@ Kan@@ i in Nigeria , published in the newspaper La Rep@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lica , the part of the city is identified as the Christian section of the place .
La Rep@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lica cited as his source the Spanish news agency E@@ fe ( where not known whether the original report has included the picture ) .
France , 2015 .
after the mass@@ acre of the B@@ oko Har@@ am , like this here , who used the image from the DR Congo to illustrate the &quot; atro@@ cities of Islam &quot; clearly , no pages such as Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster saw this .
Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster named the faul@@ ty use of the picture since 2011 in combination with Nigeria , at that time , by a post of US American , anti @-@ Islamic comm@@ ent@@ ator Pam@@ ela G@@ eller .
Germany , 2017 . &quot; Gen@@ o@@ cide against Muslims continues in Myanmar , Nobel Peace Prize in Switzerland . &quot;
this article gives attention to the continuous emergency of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims in Myanmar , but cited the work of an article by the Indian express with the image from the DR Congo ; the Indian express article was not included in the time of publication of our article .
Greece , 2012 . &quot; you are looking for ...
you are looking for an instrument of sa@@ vi@@ or of the building , who are taking care of the court of us , who are taking care of her ! &quot; ( warning !
the sho@@ cking photo you have ever seen ! ) .
this site used the picture as a test@@ ament to killing Muslim Christians .
this claim has been ref@@ uted by a Greek fact check @-@ page 2013 and once again in 2016 .
Iran , 2012 .
an association of students of the@@ ology ( Mul@@ l@@ ahs ) in Islamic countries published an open letter to support the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims on the news agency N@@ asi@@ m and used for illustration image of the DR Congo .
Italy , 2015 .

Nigeria , 2012 .
even within Nigeria , the photo from the DR Congo was divided as proof of the bom@@ bers of the B@@ oko Har@@ am in can@@ o in public discussion .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme example of a mis@@ sal use of the image from the DR Congo , using a twe@@ et , the sympathy compared to the Nig@@ eri@@ an mass@@ akers and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ ggers , the alleg@@ ations , the Roh@@ ing@@ ya are per@@ sec@@ uted , to deli@@ poison@@ ing , because the photos of it were mis@@ used .
Myanmar , 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government of Myanmar has published a portra@@ yal of what they entered as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inten@@ tional news and photos , the international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create confusion about Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these ri@@ gs , which appeared exclusively in English , also includes references to counterf@@ eit images of smells that are used in Spe@@ ech Spe@@ ech and used by extrem@@ ist groups to suggest that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and spread the other direction ( which is often dissemin@@ ated by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .

this post , which directed itself to the members of the Russian Orthodox Church , clearly shows that the picture of the Democratic Republic of Congo does not show the Christians to kill .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news insi@@ sted that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein His 2012 claimed that monks and politicians have been involved in the killing of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought together the story with the image of San@@ ge .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the picture continues to be included .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 over Stud@@ ents from the B@@ oko were released , published by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the K@@ Ã¡@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , has expressly declared that the picture does not originate from the kill@@ ings but it claims that there is a &quot; similar d@@ ash attack . &quot;
when the picture was later linked to the mass@@ acre of the B@@ oko Har@@ am , in orbit , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there would be connections to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ ya@@ Yan@@ Ä±@@ y@@ or@@ fer@@ ya@@ U@@ yu@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria burns , the world is asleep ) .
the picture of the DR Congo has been prepared with this t@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and sol@@ dered a discussion among Muslims in the B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and the proposal to Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve that their communities find these events , the mut@@ ants in the name of the Is@@ l@@ ams , had a greater attention .
USA , 2015 .
the picture was be@@ wit@@ ched as a test@@ ament to the mass@@ acre of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 ( and more than 9.@@ 300 Male ) . but the messages that were associated with it were attacked in no religious context .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , the goal was to focus attention on the relative number of the dead and a comparison of media reporting compared to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Vietnam ( Portuguese ) , 2014 .
after a message , which was alle@@ ge@@ dly written by a &quot; P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mart@@ os &quot; on the Nig@@ eri@@ an mass@@ acre , it was put into circulation , put it discussion as this here on Vietnamese and explained it to fal@@ cons .
from the embassy in which the picture was included in the DR Congo , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ iner Mission@@ aries and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mart@@ os were included .
there are further confirmed examples of a faul@@ ty use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
on other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and pages in the following countries ( on the folder in gray ) points out , but are no longer completely trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data presentations with URLs and time stamps exist on the Web@@ cra@@ w@@ ler and inter@@ fere with image names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which appeared only clearly after original ung@@ l@@ Ã¼ck of 2010 , the picture may ultimately be a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or appro@@ achable .
frames and pictures
there are two strong topics or frames ( ir@@ radiation ) that pull this poster . the first frame focused on religion .
the photo was used in relation to larger discussions on silence in connection with the murder of Christians through Muslims or - to defend Muslims - the assass@@ ination of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as through Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fr@@ aming also uses the image to discuss how an African life is subject to a European or French life .
religion understand and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth to investigate how images are used in connection with these efforts .
however , a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe this pictures longer .
with social media , there are many people who have un@@ inten@@ tional part in practice the water around a tragedy .
suggested these mood of mis@@ - and fal@@ se@@ information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and nar@@ row@@ ly the real Gre@@ ys of what actually happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo , in Nigeria and in Myanmar ?
the spread of violent images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( here for example ) .
one argument is that the re@@ mitt@@ ance of images of a ref@@ usal to recognize the tragedy . sometimes these images are requested even by the victims themselves .
at the same time , the concern is that violent images reader and audience des@@ ensi@@ tise and take them the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which examined , such as violent media act to help others ) .
while there is a lot regarding violent representations in the news media to discuss is fact that they are indispensable for the current message reporting .
techn@@ ologists experiment , because with algorithms in order to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; . you will think thoroughly about situation where an image is something suggested , which actually can also be solved by the context or on completely mis@@ used way .
an examination of false subsidies should also be taken into account as internationally as internationally .

a blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( such . un@@ brid@@ geable ) makes every effort to offer voice enth@@ used a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to be translated at all .
such words are in any language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these un@@ brid@@ geable words are already well known today ( as the famous Portuguese su@@ um@@ da@@ de ) and others that are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ m@@ esa ) .
but all contradi@@ cting stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly every attempt of a simple translation .
a word or expression is not enough , why a full explanation and sometimes some context is required to understand exactly what is meant by that one word .
these unique words have been collected quite a long time in an online list .
most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , during the author and lingu@@ ist by &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
in the blog you can find words from the Mw@@ u@@ at@@ u language , such as :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Bem@@ ing you around your parents in recognition of how you have endeav@@ oured for you in your younger years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - The convenience or sl@@ oth , which you feel after being used for cold days in the sun . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog About :
they claim other cultures , revealing other thought @-@ length and ar@@ ouse our new earth .
sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the Lingu@@ ists on this site still want to publish more of this &quot; un@@ brid@@ geable &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impres@@ sively these small languages are .

like Sri Lanka with the worst floo@@ d@@ disaster of the decade
the island of Sri Lanka is currently looking at the worst flood and penet@@ rating disaster in this decade .
triggered by Mon@@ sun , which is normally produced at the end of May , through strong ra@@ inf@@ alls the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , N@@ il@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya in 15 districts in the south and west of the country over the shore .
after an opinion of the disaster centre of Sri Lanka , from 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and nearly hundreds of people are mixed because of the floods and mud .
over 400 000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and approximately 100 000 people have been brought to 30@@ 4 safe areas .
the ra@@ inf@@ alls were moved slowly on Saturday ( 27 May ) , and the resi@@ stor@@ s in some areas went slowly .
health and hygienic hoses of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the scale of the floo@@ d@@ disaster :
floods in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water from up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users such as A@@ zz@@ am Ame@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et deliver regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the scale of the disaster .
Sri Lan@@ kas fatal floods wor@@ sen the Den@@ gu@@ e@@ fi@@ eb@@ erk@@ rise , war@@ ns Save the Children , after further rainy days are already on the way .
today , the Nel@@ u@@ wa Bus was standing in the flood , water level up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also floo@@ ded because of the yesterday over@@ looked at the Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a .
the Air Force has made available five planes for b@@ ail@@ out actions and further five are made available for transportation of emergency supplies for those in their floo@@ ded villages included .
also various organizations and start@@ ups have also explained to help .
Facebook @-@ Pages such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tim@@ s in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Rel@@ ief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on high water supply and humanitarian aid .
if any search and b@@ ail@@ ers will need drug for their operations , please call the number 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 .
for those who want to don@@ ate the dry food and life @-@ necessary goods for flood @-@ offering -
we are today in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call today the number 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 78@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if animals need help in this area .
the Tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f @-@ App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the cat@@ amaran centre is informed .
last year after the disaster of the Tro@@ pen@@ guin Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me led a &quot; high water aid &quot; button , which allowed it to users to call a vehicle to pick up assistance and donations . these were then forwarded to the s@@ cap@@ lan@@ der R@@ ote Cross .
&quot; &quot; &quot; likewise , they led a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ OS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button which had more than thousand requests and 150 successful jet@@ ties for the result of flood and penet@@ rating included people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lan@@ kan , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , they bring residents in need of security and provide help .
this has prevented the loss of other human lives , whereby the population of Sri Lan@@ kan now represents the long way up to the restoration of norm@@ ality .
the Muslims that you cannot see
the Women &apos;s March on 21 January 2017 in San Francisco .
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ ha@@ zi .
with Re@@ t.@@ Dam@@ as in January I participated in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neigh@@ bor and love girlfriend .
I trusted her my four year old daughter , they trust me her children ; she is my rock in the bran@@ ce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the one minute we are calling for a slo@@ gans for the rights of women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the next jun@@ cture , we transc@@ end rights for trans@@ gender .
we are located in a sea of umbrellas and people , some keep the iconic picture of a woman with head@@ to@@ wel high , bound by a American flag , others sk@@ ating par@@ ols against Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things do not concern yourself , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not a Muslim ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask myself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already led this conversation .
people with whom I have been working or people who know me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar that they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; that has built up in their imagination .
they healed me .
there are 1,@@ 7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all the same .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify with it to be a Muslim to different species but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is so well designed in our collective performance so well that as soon as Muslims , the same as I will not fit in , un@@ cle@@ ver@@ ised .
dischar@@ ging are being executed
I am not alone with it alone .
this is even the poet , whose poetry in America is most sold : Rum@@ i .
which images come in mind , if you think of it ?
love ?
peace ?
when Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and jel@@ ly .
Islam , the Kor@@ an and the Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the center of his poetry .
but in the western idea , religion is deleted from Rum@@ is , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this deletion makes a big part of the history of the 1,@@ 7 billion Muslims in this world .
another one of others is in the reduction of Muslim pictures of Muslims , the Western books have already been colonial for centuries .
this temp@@ ting image language is determined by the dark man that you should fear and the exotic woman that you should save .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian American scientist Edward S@@ aid broke the story behind these pictures in the 1970s .
but these images also prot@@ ru@@ de today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood will continue to emp@@ ower them .
I have been working for thirteen years in the news industry and I have seen how this powerful , faul@@ ty Nar@@ r@@ atives dominate our news@@ fe@@ eds .
this Nar@@ rati@@ v over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed the reality that have led to nine Muslim women in the last three decades , while the US was not even able to choose their first female presidential race .
this Nar@@ rati@@ v failed to acknowledge that if French , Muslim women are hin@@ dered by their head@@ to@@ wel in public buildings and su@@ ck @-@ Arabic , Muslim women forced by their government to cover their entire body , which are both sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group exercises its &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this powerful nar@@ rati@@ v weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead movements for change .
it seems that the first Muslim prayers have been talked to American soil of Afri@@ kan@@ ers , which were brought together with slavery .
it del@@ etes the existence of Que@@ er Muslims .
this Nar@@ rati@@ v has occupied our collective imagination so deep and flaw@@ ed that often Si@@ kh men and children are becoming the objective of anti @-@ li@@ ous mix@@ ers and ra@@ ils .
because of these stories , which we tell and because of the way we share it , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; others . &quot;
to the 1,@@ 7 billion belong
in the news industry we do more than just stories to tell them based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create fo@@ d@@ atives who help us understand the world .
and my industry failed to record the Nar@@ rati@@ v of 1.@@ 7 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed here where seven million Muslims make up the highest degree of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; various &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious group in America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than one third of the entire Muslim population are African Americans .
six of ten American Muslims belong to the immigrants from the first generation , which come from 77 countries .

four decades ago , my native parents came to New York to live their American dream .
my mother put her first jewellery design in 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the skyscrapers of New York ; skyscrapers were made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ cian from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
back then when Khan started the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were un@@ f@@ aded Muslims and Americans .
but am I now irre@@ voc@@ able Muslims and Americans ?
sometimes , if I ask people why I don &apos;t say a pig , I say - instead of my Muslim recipes , or to bring my hand@@ hand@@ ker@@ chief , whom all Muslims bear in themselves - &quot; from respect to Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
I Scher@@ ze , we do not carry all hand@@ ker@@ or@@ ans with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must also be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or to be selected almost always for additional security ch@@ equ@@ es at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who try to fight far @-@ spread lies over Islam .
these lies are produced on the ongoing volume of a well @-@ trained Islam@@ ists , Th@@ ink Tank and experts for fal@@ se@@ information which is our already faul@@ ty image of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories that we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in more than just a stran@@ ger who gives a woman the head to@@ wel .
or as the start@@ ling map of attacks on mos@@ ques in the whole USA , see below .
scre@@ enshot of the AC@@ L@@ U website .
Islam@@ opho@@ bia in its ugly forms attacks our affili@@ ation .
it acc@@ esses our identity , which is so wide , so versatile and complex , that it is impossible to fit into a drawer .

I would like to explain this .
I was born as a Muslim but a Muslim was first born into my imagination when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a Pres@@ by@@ ter@@ i@@ an Church in New York .
when social scientist describe religious life , they attack the following terms : faith , behavior and affili@@ ation .
my Muslim faith and behaviour might not always be visible , but they are there .
maybe my girlfriend , my neighbour , my rock in the bran@@ ce , see that I am Muslim when they could look through the 15 meter concrete and air that separate our houses .
it would see the all@@ ab@@ end@@ ous ritual with my daughter when I saw them in my arms and protect the Arabic verses to protect the Kor@@ an and called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
every one of them I repeat three times .
I ask that they are protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one can not see .
my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow .

it is the picture of her that I can see in this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by their finished and un@@ finished paintings in the painted Su@@ fi saint . and a basket with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and four@@ teen chapters , which can be easily maneu@@ ver@@ able .
to be Muslim , to speak the prayers they had said to me if I have a bad day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim shall be how she brought me to God : Allah Mi@@ dian , what God means , my only Lord . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a people that was founded over centuries - through a &quot; Imperi@@ um &quot; colonial , a company founded with the name Hon@@ orary Bri@@ tish Ost@@ ini@@ dien company , it has a deep meaning , God , my only Lord .

inter@@ mitt@@ edly , while he writes books on modern Islam and about independence K@@ ash@@ mir@@ s , crying N@@ ana J@@ aan ple@@ aded to his family in India ruled K@@ ash@@ mir , family that he could not close into his arms in half a century .
belonging to know that there are millions of Kurds and Palestinians to know their families , like with my grandfather , of col@@ oni@@ alists , who were apart from the Muslim world as at the game risk .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim is to know that over the last two centuries Europeans all have to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; colonial countries &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means to know that the first fli@@ eger@@ bom@@ b of history was rejected a century ago over a Muslim country .
it means to know that at the same time the grandfather of my grand@@ mother , an Indian , cold sub@@ tan of the British empire , was referred to by the newspapers of his time as &quot; dangerous , &quot; as he led the first mosque in England .
yet before there were planes he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever was and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .
the Word of Islam .

to my Muslim tribe of the 1,@@ 7 billion you go back deeply into our unforgettable family rooms ; our un@@ plug@@ ged history .
it means to remember that four@@ teen years ago the most powerful military in the world , with troops that were distributed over every continent aside from the Ant@@ arctic , distributed in Iraq to pursue mass destruction of weapons , which did not exist .
it means to know that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried in the ruins of war .
an American Muslim means to know that the su@@ icide @-@ rate has risen under veter@@ an since 2001 by more than 32 percent .
it means to know that if a tragedy is secret to the US and the susp@@ ects a Muslim name , history is reported four times more than a story with a white attack .
it means to know that forty @-@ ten years ago the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , of a liber@@ ated black slaves was called Bil@@ al .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it means to know that two hundred years ago a Afri@@ kan@@ ger called Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ lav@@ ed and brought to this land . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means to call Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the warmth that I sen@@ sed as people filled the airports to fight against the Muslim Ban .
it is the hope I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black life .
an Americ@@ an@@ erin , a Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ erin , a P@@ ah@@ i , a Pun@@ j@@ ab@@ i , a Muslim and a journalist , the in@@ tough@@ est inter@@ sec@@ ality of our with multi@@ plying identi@@ ties , but to fail to further communicate them to others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Nar@@ rati@@ v of 1.@@ 7 billion is more possibilities than a sor@@ cer@@ vi@@ ate , but is represented in the reduced branch of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
being a mother means to make me care of my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people build on this pole structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia has existed in the Muslim registr@@ ars who began with President Bush and extended under President Obama .
it consists in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists in immigration , which takes five years old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it consists in a country which closes its borders towards people from just the countries that are bombar@@ ded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no @-@ Fly @-@ list &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is largely Arabs and Muslims in the sight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the wars that we lead and the bom@@ bs which we throw on Muslim countries .
because of the stories we tell and because of those we do not tell , we are here today .
in a study involving the title A@@ scent of Man , scientists of the North@@ western University showed a scientific un@@ proper image and create them to judge groups on a scale from 1 to 100 in terms of evolution .
Muslims received the s@@ ligh@@ test score .
the con@@ vers@@ ations that we have to lead
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deep dar@@ ing , the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have decades back to recognize the roots of our fears and the faul@@ ty and dangerous imaging prints , which we engage in our news action .
at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry , trying to grasp our many frequently ties identi@@ ties and forgotten history .
the Pod@@ cast lake , S@@ ay airport of Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the viral vide@@ os@@ erie Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Schu@@ elo Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative , multip@@ ly Muslim authors and MS Mar@@ vel , the Pak@@ ist@@ ani , mus@@ li@@ ically , American Super@@ hero@@ ine - all this makes me hope .

col@@ lage by the author .
but I am concerned because of this difficult global time point in which we are located .
and this moment has consequences that go beyond the 1,@@ 7 billion .
there is one reason for conspir@@ acy the@@ or@@ ist who existed in the dark corners of the internet now the White House .
they have grown expon@@ entially because they have made Muslims to &quot; others . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is another group that has grown expon@@ entially by created the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few years ago it had not been given yet ; now they dominate large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the realities and the history of which I was not aware of when I was so old as it is now my daughter , but I had made myself to an un@@ winding Muslim .
things I left here like a bread@@ cru@@ el in my speech .
things that might ar@@ ouse memories , because in all the inter@@ sections that make our humanity likes a story , where someone is made to a &quot; others . &quot;
right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley will take place in the context of the 8th annual conference to Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; over a hundred ac@@ adem@@ ics talk about our problems with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; structural racism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but these are no terms with which we usually throw in our schools or which we read in our newspapers .

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
why would I tell you here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who has shown us how wars are being managed and humans are enth@@ r@@ alled by the creation of the &quot; other &quot; in public conception , four decades ago by themselves scientific Stan@@ ford .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to put ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of it , consciously and consciously , in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because employment that we have no president , in which we have already broken countries and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people bom@@ bs &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.9 billion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narr@@ ator wants to preserve urban diversity
stor@@ yt@@ eller , of Flickr users Daniele Ros@@ si , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a possibility to connect here and now despite a language barrier with someone ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Perry , founder of the initiative Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) is the detection of stories in their original language a possible response to it .
global Vo@@ ices reported a short overview of another initiative by Steven Bird , the Un@@ re@@ plac@@ eable Blog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written word , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and become the language variety of large cities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Oak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has already carried out events since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite as little languages are not passed on to the children there .
the creators of the project is valid :
the mass of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create towns that accept diversity - safe spaces where residents do not forget to belong to it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you often listen to understand &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these events instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the listening to appreciate , to make . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , Stor@@ yt@@ eller tells her story first in her own language and translate them in English .
even if the participants are not professional stor@@ yt@@ eller , their devotion and their presentation do so that the audiences can be redeemed on it .
they call laughter and emotions than whether the language no longer a barrier .
the following video shows for example a traditional history of Burkina Faso , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou is also the opportunity to explain the customs of nar@@ rati@@ os for their country .
in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the f@@ abel from h@@ asen and the P@@ avian in the language of Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
after he explained the importance of his nav@@ el , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked , &quot; How is this one to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a wide smile he shares his sense of incl@@ usi@@ veness :
you have listened !
you were attentive ...
they were quite with me !
so far , the events of Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling have taken place in three cities , and the organizers hope to expand this . all those who are inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own stor@@ yt@@ ellers .
Puerto Rico calls for the United States Reb@@ ir@@ ation of the government debt
with the aim of a re@@ consideration of public debt of Puerto Rico , who participated in 72 million US dollars , participating in 72 million US dollars , participating in the pu@@ zz@@ orian Capit@@ ol , the Government building of the capital , and ran up to the Plaza de Col@@ Ã³n in the Old Town of San Ju@@ an .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was called by the group@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fr@@ ente Ci@@ ud@@ ad@@ ano por la Audi@@ tor@@ ia de la Deu@@ da &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( bourgeois front for the neur@@ ons of debts ) and the Ec@@ ology meeting in Puerto Ric@@ os . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the inter@@ c@@ essors of the debts of debt also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
the people Puerto Ric@@ os demands that the politicians , ban@@ kers and government agencies responsible for debts are responsible for their corruption .
we call for a financial examination and a guideline committee without personal interests in public debt , with a firm , our working conditions appropriate re@@ mun@@ er@@ ation , which acts in favour of the economy .
we will pres@@ st and supp@@ resses .
the people of Puerto Ric@@ os refuse to pay a debt that is not its .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be able to decrease with decreasing pay@@ outs .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not into the state @-@ established territory of the USA - suff@@ ers from a serious financial crisis .
hence , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ governmental non @-@ profit organisation with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , a law on government responsibility as an alternative to the existing state of state .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ric@@ os requires a vast restructuring of state infrastructure .
the measures imposed from the outside without the participation and conviction of the citizens are at risk to be rejected by the people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the demonstration led the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; night watch for light and truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

artists and writers know the work of the missing Syrian developer Bas@@ sel Saf@@ adi

the Syrian Palestinian web developer Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bas@@ sel Saf@@ adi , has been mixed since over a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives were continuing the campaign for his freedom and remember the contributions he has made for an open network .
at this year &apos;s re : public@@ a , the annual conference on digital culture , which will be aligned in Berlin , devoted an event to the # Free@@ Bas@@ sel campaign .
MÃ©@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a researcher at the CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ Ã¼h@@ ling , business manager at Book Spr@@ ints , a publisher of the book C@@ ost of Freedom : a Colle@@ ctive enquiry ( The cost of freedom : collective post@@ research ) .
the book that has been published last year and is available to license freely , contains a number of sets that deal with free culture in the face of oppression .
it is a hom@@ age to Bas@@ sel and his work .
in the introduction it is called :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this book wants to discuss how mo@@ tions are constructed for free knowledge and what the real costs are connected with which this is connected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge , have page on page to look over the fog who surrounds our news@@ eds and to create some sense from our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , beloved and celebrating Internet @-@ volunteers , who has been det@@ ained in Syria since 15 March 2012 .
his name was painted out of the directory of Ad@@ ra prison , where he sat on 3 October 2015 .
since then , we have no information about its current state or residence .
the introductory part of his book with the title Colle@@ ctive memory gives his friends and his family a voice that push for his release and want to know him back in his normal life and freedom .
to see how Bas@@ sel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us have to start thinking about their own f@@ ates , deeds and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we decide to do ?
what have we abandoned in this process of temporarily extreme convi@@ ctions ?
the Web@@ developer for Open Source and digital activ@@ ist has been in custody of Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
in October 2015 Bas@@ sel was transferred from the Ad@@ ra @-@ prison , a non @-@ military institution , transferred to an unknown place .
his wife , the writer and An@@ gen@@ tin N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the &quot; military police Bas@@ sel had taken on the basis of a &quot; strict secret &quot; command of the military Court from his cell in Ad@@ ra . &quot;
G@@ ha@@ zi reported that she had been contacted by persons on November 12 , 2015 , who presented themselves as an insi@@ der of the Assad administration and presented them from a alleged death struggle against her husband .
his residence and condition remains unknown but still unknown .
a pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bas@@ le played a crucial role in attracting access to the Internet and knowledge of the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , Techn@@ ologist and at the moment the head of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bas@@ sel writes on the sides 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bas@@ le cultural prototype was looking forward to the work he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras virtually .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross@@ roads of numerous civilizations and here merge Greek @-@ ro@@ man architecture types with hi@@ es@@ ful traditions and Persian influences .
Bas@@ sel could not know that ten years after he started working with this work , the IS would put everything in doing this architecture , which is not only em@@ bo@@ died the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens , but the world .
this strike into the digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a period of time that will be inv@@ alu@@ able for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
iron@@ ically , Bas@@ sel could not finish this project yet .
N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I spent my entire life with it , dream of freedom and he taught me to embrace them .
I am overwhelmed when I call his name .
Bas@@ sel put me English in , even when he was already in prison .
I learned to read and speak English well .
he has always shared his knowledge with every one who has asked . he taught others In@@ det@@ ained to read and speak English .
Bas@@ sel has opened the gate to technology . he taught me to use both computer and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
he also brought together other in@@ sti@@ ces as they use computers , at least theoretically , without having actually kept one in their hands .
G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ ste ( waiting ) , a promot@@ er that she wrote to her husband in the years 2012 until 2015 when he was in custody .
Bas@@ sel and N@@ oura have worked together on the book for a year .
they mu@@ g@@ ed the lyrics to him if they visited him and he put them out of the Arabic to English .
the book is roy@@ alty @-@ free .
cover from Youssef Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It happens &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Bas@@ le History is not unique in Syria .
since the beginning of the protests in 2011 against the regime Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime , according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Sy@@ ris@@ al Network for Human Rights ) more than 6@@ 5,000 people disappeared .
those who were arrested or disappeared under violence by the regime were tor@@ tured or even executed .
until 2016 , Am@@ nest@@ y International has died according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nest@@ y International at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans in custody .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for release of Bas@@ sel since 2012 .
today , we repeat our demand in the hope that we have to do this for the last time .
Mos@@ ambi@@ que : because of corruption betra@@ yal director after release date again at previous post
Mos@@ ambi@@ ans re@@ acted with anger upon a corruption in which a government member returned after half of his sentence to the workplace in the state apparatus , where the corruption was committed .
this is a Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment together with four other def@@ endants ( around 800 000 Euro ) for 22 years .
the money came from public funds from the Moz@@ ambi@@ que airports , whose advice Cam@@ ba@@ za stood between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 because of good guidance and immediately requested his re@@ setting into the company , which happened on 19 April then also .
in accordance with an opinion of the General Administr@@ ative Bar of the Republic , which claims the application , there would be no obstacles reason for Cam@@ ba@@ za , again to refer to his old post as the company did not accomplish discipl@@ in@@ ar@@ ders after his detention .
however , many citizens are not doing the action well .
the Centre for Public integrity ( Centro de Int@@ eg@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lica , shortly C@@ IP ) , an local institution committed to public transparency , condemned into an interview with the Deutsche Welle to make the decision of the company , the director again :
represents a return in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a return with regard to the efforts of our legal system , so the C@@ IP .
what we take to notice is that the company should have a discipl@@ in@@ tra in opposition to the contra@@ vention of the opposition .
however , the company apparently decl@@ ining and prompted no appropriate legal steps to apply the appropriate functions .
Eg@@ Ã­@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Mos@@ que social media , this behaviour also ref@@ uses and considers the case as a &quot; res@@ ist &quot; :
if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent type , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to sentence in prison and that half of which had dinner .
he could keep paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could consult and keep his image polish .
but since it is in@@ competent , he has agreed to be integrated into the company that he helped to cause damage .
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is happy to pay for his silence .
contradi@@ ct@@ ory !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Moz@@ ambi@@ ans and student of Political Science in Brazil says that the director had no mor@@ als :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was rewarded by the state , because he in@@ quired it I can &apos;t believe that one has been rewarded with someone in such a way that has already co@@ war@@ med the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za is missing the mor@@ als and serve the state , * he had already served a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead he only serves themselves at the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as a hand@@ ele has become an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself is tired of this man who was re@@ charged and ultimately sentenced to a long prison sentence .
honestly , I don &apos;t know why this man was rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ Ãº@@ te preferred to remember the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , recall that a th@@ ief belongs to prison :
thi@@ eves belong to the prison of Sam@@ ora Mach@@ ines , not only for the first independent president , but also as a sharp , tri@@ mmer , and - next to said - proph@@ etic speakers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one of his most famous oral representations was , as it confirmed energetic , that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a ambitious human being has to be capable of sell also the fa@@ ther@@ land for its ambition , his own individual interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sam@@ ora said : &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that this is not so . he does not change the tactic , but it does not turn from its ambitions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a ambitious human being is a criminal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also dis@@ missed :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he sat down 10 years and came free .
and today it sets up the company , in which he re@@ tre@@ ad money back under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - over the course of himself ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) 12 May 2017

&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook is blocking the rac@@ ist word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users to wrong &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar Pa@@ e &quot; means Ki@@ cher@@ en@@ se or spher@@ ical .

according to the statements by Facebook @-@ users in Myanmar , the famous Social Network took their posts on the net because they included the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East @-@ Indian origin or in general as ad@@ j@@ ective . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or you are looking for ( in Bur@@ m@@ ese script ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma within the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent years , the rise of radi@@ cal@@ al nation@@ alist movements of the word has given an extremely valuable con@@ notation .
in particular , it is a word that mostly used by Ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as a hate speech against Muslims , which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to fight @-@ hate language in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of sensual content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; may normally be associated with racism but the word itself is not automatically calling @-@ hate language .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that even po@@ sts in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts in the purpose of its use .
in addition , there are several bur@@ ial words with the different mean@@ ings that have the same letter as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , chair is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters , as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar Pa@@ e &apos; ( Sp@@ age ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar o@@ at &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ ier A@@ ung Ka@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of one of my friends has been er@@ ased today because he enth@@ uses the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends in a rich way if they knew how he could alle@@ vi@@ ate his back pain by doing a vocabulary .
the proposition ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resembles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different .
there were different responses to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win H@@ it is the opinion that she will reduce Al @-@ speech National Nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook analy@@ tic must be that it must distribute all posts to dissemin@@ ate racism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook del@@ etes the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not manually . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it fil@@ tered the word automatically .
the detection will not understand what you write on Facebook .
what it should do instead , the post office is carefully to analyse and control it by checking the next words .
for example &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar Pa@@ e &quot; ( medi@@ a@@ eval ) .
the good is that these three @-@ legged nation@@ alists spread to spread the hate @-@ language , a pretty good lesson .
now it is time to circumc@@ ised its nation@@ alism .
while the action may send a strong signal to all who dissemin@@ ate information , may not stop the efficiency of this strategy for a long time .
the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ chat have proven that the cens@@ or@@ ship of keywords often become a kiss and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks will simply begin to use a new word or an alternative notation of the zen@@ ith of words to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described as Facebook began to delete his posts when he only wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; from the social network is ban@@ ished :
... when I was aware of this new Directive on Facebook , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the Word is locked .
iron@@ ically , my post office has been removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to the Li@@ ken , posts and parts of content for 24 hours , because of the post &quot; Facebook Community standards did not escape . &quot;
Facebook has a variety of posts away from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate of radi@@ cal@@ al nation@@ alists .
Patrick Murphy wrote that his post has been removed , which has nothing to do with hate language :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post , the author told his mind about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook would have to do more before the beginning of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community to ask advice :
Facebook might have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce racism in Burma by their platform , but it does not work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such words to cens@@ ze will only bring more hatred within the different communities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also seems as if they have started it without local context or technical support and so words like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inheritance curr@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even when they found out that they have made mistakes , they did not attempt the fal@@ sely deleted Po@@ sts .
if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits , they would like to make a great turnover , this would be great .
Fac@@ ebooks automatic cens@@ or@@ ship has taken care of much mo@@ ck@@ ery among users .
instead of taking it seriously , users now make use of Facebook funny and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate language to see if their posts are taken from the net .
here you can see some screenshots of fac@@ ebook , which no @-@ hate language spoken , but still removed :

the Bur@@ m@@ ese text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair and pe@@ sen@@ curr@@ y and watch an Indian film .
just to try out whether Facebook removed the post , which contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;

scre@@ enshot , with permission .
over the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have used to expand social networks to expand their voices and their influence .
among other things , hate language in social networks shall in addition to heat in the communities in Myanmar in addition to heat , especially in the area Rak@@ h@@ ine , where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to escape .
Facebook was critici@@ zed for his failure , the glorious hate @-@ hate speech on his bur@@ dens pages under control , critici@@ zed .
but instead of simply transc@@ ending the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have better running out more on context than code concentrated initiatives and learned from them .
in Tr@@ ini@@ dad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is the end with the children &apos;s to@@ e
a wedding ring in the sand .

the children &apos;s to@@ e is now illegal in Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament approved a law unanim@@ ously decided to offer this practice so that the saving age is now under 18 .
before this change of the spouse some members held the du@@ alistic and Muslim religious communities in practice , and in May 2016 , brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of inter@@ religious organization ( IR@@ O ) , a group , the representatives of the various religious groups of the country gathered that the state does not inter@@ fere , since that , age do not determine the maturity . &quot;
this happened , regardless of the fact that Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago is a contractual partner of the UN &apos;s rights law , the min@@ ors as , each person under the age of 18 . &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children who were married with 15 , in Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago 2.8 percent , and with 18 it was 8.@@ 1 percent .
in 2011 the statistical office of the country confirmed that of 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 .
online @-@ peti@@ tions and social media movements that stri@@ ves to create laws to inf@@ ront , followed at the foot and gr@@ ace@@ ful of great support . undoubtedly , they help to bring this outcome .
nevertheless , not everything went smoothly .
a Hind@@ u @-@ leader , for example had no concerns , the critics of the children &apos;s before , they should , are dam@@ n &apos;t care of their own affairs . &quot;
this kind of religious opposition sort of tension in this actually uncomplicated thing , and eventually we got doubts as to whether the opposition would agree to the Legisl@@ ative bill at all .
but at the beginning of 2017 the legislative draft was decided against the children &apos;s to@@ e - despite four sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent who was discussed at the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law .
now only the President of the country must agree and announce the law .
one of the sen@@ ators of the country on Facebook gave an status update , which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle was again posted on Inst@@ ag@@ ram :
Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill of law against children &apos;s to@@ e was decided in the Represent@@ atives of 35 votes against it , and no one decided against it .
after having been decided before in the Senate , the draft can now become the law .
the majority of social media users was enthusiastic because the laws were finally changed at the children &apos;s to@@ e .
Facebook @-@ member Lo@@ vell Francis , who was a prime minister in the Ministry of Education , said :
it has too much time and unnecessary just needed to disgu@@ ise the core of the thing , but do you know what ? the children &apos;s to@@ e is now illegal in Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago now and that is almost every price .
while A@@ bel Jackson think it was definitely long enough to create the practice , Lara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas over@@ jo@@ yed that the day was finally come :
public Status Update on Facebook by Lara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which said : , , Excellent news !
the Austrian Act has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for it - 0 on it ! ! ! ! &quot;
Fol@@ der Mut@@ ota , whom the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) list@@ ens to a civil society that openly spoke openly about how important the adoption of the law was , noted :
the saving age in Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the religious con@@ fession of 18 years .
the draft to the amendment of the Act has been adopted today , on 9 June 2017 .
in the House of Represent@@ atives there are 41 members and of which 35 were present at the vote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all members who were opposed to the law have voted for the law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the children &apos;s to@@ e is legally not allowed in Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long battle ( ... ) # child@@ p@@ age@@ manager .
many thanks to all activists who have touched him .
congratulations .
a thanks to our members .
but a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj therefore , the Secretary General of San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hind@@ u @-@ organization of the country .
months ago , Mahar@@ aj has proclaimed his intention to undertake judicial steps , the law should be passed and he seems to redeem his promises .
during the general state of Paris Al ra@@ wi , a fe@@ eder of the law , said , unless Mahar@@ aj on the law should act , most social media users would like to tackle the debate on the subject differently .
Patricia Wor@@ rell suggested :
dear sat , if we , instead of talking about the discussion , in a way that only panic and dis@@ grace may say that the state , our daughters , protects them that they may be of great , hard @-@ minded men who are accountable to them , would you then ready to continue the discussion ?
or do you believe it is not a problem ?
however , whether it comes to a judicial approach against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where children &apos;s to@@ e are legal or still the norm , though there are laws which they say .

by mirrors from websites , Turkish users can view back Wikipedia content
the English @-@ speaking Wikipedia @-@ page was presented on 18 January 2012 , contradi@@ ct@@ ory to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and PI@@ PA copyright law in the United States , internationally bl@@ acked .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
since over a month now Turkey un@@ lock the popular and on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based enc@@ y@@ clo@@ pedia .
day by day is clear@@ er how important the platform for users is to find helpful and reliable information .
both students and re@@ porter and fans of TV series are opposed to blocking .
although many techn@@ ologists vers@@ ed Internet users are used to use ren@@ al tools for blocked websites ( an up @-@ to @-@ date article from the New York Times reported that Turkey has the third largest VPN em@@ val@@ ence in the world ) , most usual Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been lo@@ wered since 2008 by Wikipedia , as recently published in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society on Harvard University , will take place regular block@@ ages of the Internet since 2007 , after the Internet law ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted .
in China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world , when it comes to the massive cens@@ or@@ ship of Wikipedia .
while the platform continues to be blocked , there are now several Mir@@ r@@ or@@ pages ( pages that mirror the content from Wikipedia and frequently updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , as the platform passed all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centralized Peer @-@ to @-@ peer network ( i.e. machine @-@ machine connections ) which is not based on the system of domain names and therefore makes a complete cens@@ or@@ ship difficult .
the content is not available in spite of its statutory prohibition .
in a blo@@ g@@ post IP@@ FS reported about his efforts :
after we have heard the news ( via the blocking from Wikipedia ) , we put everything from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , the possibility to read the contents on de@@ centralized and distributed way .
this can help users to view at least all Wikipedia content , even if they cannot achieve the website www.@@ wikipe@@ di@@ a.org .
IP@@ FS was also assumed that this step was independent of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is only about screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to handle the sperm .

Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos that he saw around him , never satisfied . they were bl@@ ur@@ red with poorly positioned moti@@ fs and seas@@ oned colours .
the motivated him to carry himself a camera with himself and try to settle the situation .
then he was still a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves to bring down to the international stage as an animal world .
and his homeland right next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offering him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that ste@@ er attention to Nep@@ al@@ an animal world .
he described Facebook , like him this first @-@ class situation helps in his work :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Parks , a world natural heritage . what could it be better for a passionate wildlife photographers ! !
I just rested at home as I suddenly called Navar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) . he had received a call from my Father that on the banks of the Rap@@ ti river would be a leop@@ ard .
the river dam@@ m is only a few minutes away from the village of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I started with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father had watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river where the Leopard was and I immediately began to cr@@ ashing pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar aims to cooperate with the authorities to gain international recognition for Nept@@ une and would like to deepen the understanding of the wild animals that wild animals are not as horri@@ bly as they look .
and he should know it , because he was faced with tig@@ ers from face to face :
a tiger can &apos;t be bothered by the opinion of the sheep ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleep time for all animals and birds .
also I was at home because of the darkness on the way back home , when suddenly the king of the Bu@@ ster appeared . he immediately starts , we see ourselves and he s@@ alute me through the S@@ al @-@ trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar the logo &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos .
however , his passion for the advancement of Nept@@ une and Wild@@ life is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days , and lived mostly in a tent in order to make at the Bar@@ dia National Park recordings of Ot@@ tern . up to 12 days it lasted until he took a tiger photographed and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist income .

this entry was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and originally appeared on Video Volunte@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community organization from India .
a revised version was published here as part of a content sharing Agreement .
in many parts of India , it is to avoid women with the greatest care , the name of her husband or even older men in the family .
instead they use a pron@@ o@@ uns or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h women give women that they should respect the husband because of the social pressure , as well as fear of the consequences , they should respect the norm to maintain this practice .
last year Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was condemned by a hypo@@ cris@@ y and rejected by their family and the village community after having addressed a re@@ un@@ married relatives .
the tradition of their wives are also not mentioned in the name , is also common among men . however , they have much less right instructions to fear , if at all , they should not occur in this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health personnel , as well as house@@ wives , a unique club , and were therefore quickly become the main progressive topic of the city .
it is a place only for them to discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
as one of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the Community Video Volunte@@ ers and advocates the reduction of Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ has worked for seven years with the help of her video camera on the exposure of practices , such as children &apos;s hei@@ r to the exile of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS infected , and guides these clubs .
it tells about how these clubs have created a safe place for these women , and they simultaneously made the ambass@@ ador of the change at the same time .
the first video , which showed the Roh@@ ini in its discussion , acted by women , who did not name her husband &apos;s name .
she chose this issue because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem that women can easily identify with .
not to address the name of her husband is a bracelet , which they maintain all obligations and never questioned .
Roh@@ ini says :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman has respected her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not stop this is considered a back@@ bone as a woman without mor@@ als .
the tradition has become so deeply rooted , that we have never made thoughts about this discussion .
at the beginning was Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband so far , at home on how it works .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband were silent for a long time after the video was at an end .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said , I would like to name it from now on his name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this self @-@ confidence in luggage , Roh@@ ini started its first discussion club .
many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; never before . some believed that there was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tried to get the discussion with an exercise .
Roh@@ ini asked any participant to tell the name of her husband with different emotions - happy , upset , sad , affection@@ ate and so on .
then she asked all , &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us how they want , means that they do not respect us ?
should it not be equal ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when she brought the name of her husband on her lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra on the Bre@@ ak of a centuries @-@ old tradition , in the married women never speak the name of her husband .
Roh@@ ini tells :
a woman was so shy that during the whole exercise , she decided to go just before him ; another one decided to move the whole ancest@@ ral frustration against him and his family by cur@@ sed him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
still in the rush of adrenal@@ in to have broken with an ancient br@@ ushing , the women decided that they would actually attempt at home to name her husband &apos;s name .
and they held their word .
in the next days Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports .
the husband called a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas they put in the head : his wife could not stop his name .
another club member decided to do it at dinner before the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law she was star@@ red , she got fear and said that it was an error .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini meant to do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of a participant in was less understand@@ ably and the situation de@@ formed in violence .
Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as the wearing of the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot on the forehead , which indicates the sp@@ est@@ atus :
why do only women show that they are married ?
I said to my husband , that I would carry the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red spot if he also saw it .
he laugh@@ ed only and I heard it to carry it .
the other women have not stopped completely , but mine , they are now in a better position to choose to themselves , not to carry it on some days .
for many women the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do a trip on each discussion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want the women to ensure that what could hear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent months they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes ; they d@@ anced and sang and reported about things they had never thought beforehand .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have been talking about some things , for example like our identi@@ ties to our hus@@ bands , never talked so honestly .
it feels great to say certain things loud , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion round , we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing .
some women in the group have carried only sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most is that okay , but some wanted a sal@@ mon Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt about a p@@ ants , wear ; they have not drunk .
after much dispute and discussion about the merits of their own clothing , the mor@@ als combined with the Sar@@ is and much more , sm@@ ed Roh@@ ini her own couple of cur@@ tas ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) into a discussion , so that the women could wear them .
next they have decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can carry je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is certain that they will be able to create it .
on the question , whether in the five months since its first discussion club has changed a little , the Roh@@ ini confirms that things are slowly coming into roles :
we have only done small steps so far .
some women pro@@ bi@@ ased it a few times , but then heard back to say the name of her husband .
some , included me , do it yet , but only if they are alone and no other family members are involved .
only one or two say the name of her husband : only one or two women now carry zinc on their forehead .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes that they want to achieve in their lives - like f@@ eil@@ ing for more freedom of movement or the own clos@@ eness - at the end of a hard to navig@@ ating river .
by giving each other self confidence , they will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a victim of the patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am it too .
but this club gives each one of us confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not just limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes in the club home and other people of it will talk about what we are talking about and what we do .
we are all sitting in the same boat .

the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ i@@ ko , who was exclusively inter@@ viewed in London in 1964 on the occasion of the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit :
for just about five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this has not enough to rot@@ ate the Japanese .
the human being has quickly become clear , that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many well known Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
the music of the c@@ ult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; told Ry@@ u@@ i@@ chi Is@@ aka , President of the Retail Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review .

we all love in our house the Beat@@ les .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; W@@ inn@@ ie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; -@@ pupp@@ et John Lenn@@ on should be present or not .

a new system of kidn@@ apping of sparkling wine , pres@@ um@@ ably for aber@@ ration purpose , worrying the police of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , a province in Moz@@ ambi@@ que . the local government now called a series of operations to stop the Prak@@ tik .
at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ k , a few kilometers from border to Malawi .
one of the victims was be@@ headed and a part of the organs were removed .
two men were arrested and were arrested in the succession that the organs of sham@@ ans are used in Tanzania and Malawi .
it will give the local super@@ sti@@ tions that the head of a glorious man &apos;s gold was enth@@ used or wealth , explained the police prec@@ ursor of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia the BBC .
it is the first time that consecutive attacks on gl@@ amor@@ ous men were registered in Moz@@ ambi@@ que .
another group , the aim of murder for ob@@ sc@@ ure purposes is people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the fact that the UN in the South African country led a mission to investigate this Prak@@ tik .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of Southern Africa , especially in neighbouring Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to fight these super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudi@@ ces .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who plan to travel to the country :
attention to we@@ ah@@ le men who are travelling to Moz@@ ambi@@ que Gl@@ atz@@ kÃ¶@@ p@@ ous men in Moz@@ ambi@@ que are the aim of ritu@@ alistic attacks , warned the mos@@ ambi@@ que police according to the latest assass@@ ination of three smo@@ o@@ genic men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were in the district Mil@@ k , where the murder took place , arrested .
Hus@@ sen@@ e Alg@@ y Adam@@ o , student and residents of the city of In@@ ham@@ ans in the south of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , said that the local police have already been going on :
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of gl@@ amor@@ ous men .
the persecution and assass@@ ination of gl@@ amor@@ ous individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district Mor@@ ru@@ mb@@ ala , province of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , for probably super@@ visor , cultural moti@@ fs and is considered by the traditional sham@@ ans in order ( PR@@ M ) , which also indicates that a belief existed , according to the victims in their mind , the riches generated .
in recent days three men were mur@@ dered with hair @-@ problems in this part of the country .
Angela Fer@@ re@@ ira Sam@@ an@@ tha shared on Facebook the chron@@ icle of the Blo@@ ggers poor Sn@@ ai@@ ppa , who pointed out that the problem is part of the larger social difficulty , facing Moz@@ ambi@@ que :
I would like to be ashamed of E@@ IN Mos@@ ambi@@ que , DAS is ashamed of a country where people would have on the road to claim sex against good notes , work and other services , a nation in which the people would harm or even their lives to earn their bread , a country in which neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor cold or &quot; black magic , &quot; are hun@@ ted that aim to get to their wealth .
despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some of the opportunity for flaw@@ less humor cannot be missed .
Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , Scientific assistant of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Moz@@ ambi@@ que and enthusiastic Twitter @-@ utility , twe@@ et that both the chief of the district Mor@@ ru@@ mb@@ ala , Pedro S@@ ange , as well as the Poli@@ ze@@ is@@ pre@@ cher Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zi@@ as , In@@ Ã¡@@ cio D@@ ina , both gl@@ atz@@ kÃ¶@@ p@@ ont are :

free Bas@@ sel : Ne@@ tizen Under Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) new reactions from the international community to medical treatment of Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and Dis@@ sid@@ ent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o
a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia that probably has been made recently .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 in Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of det@@ ained Chinese dis@@ sid@@ ents Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has drawn attention in the international community after his lawyer has been announced at the end of June that he has been sent to hospital due to liver cancer in the final stage .
in 2009 Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years imprisonment for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state of state ) , after joining the Charter of the Charter 08 , a manifes@@ to which was calling for democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
the State Department in China has referred to Li@@ us case as &quot; an internal matter , &quot; and a spokes@@ person he said it as &quot; not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot;
nevertheless , China will continue to call up from the international community , the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and his wife , Di@@ ers in Li@@ u X@@ ia , allowed to release him a treatment abroad .
while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely out@@ wi@@ ped out .
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
United Nations
pointer R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the High Com@@ miss@@ ar of the United Nations for Human Rights , met at the end of June Chinese officials to discuss the fall of Li@@ u .
a spokes@@ man refused to comment whether the United Nations should exercise pressure in order to allow li@@ u abroad a treatment .
Norway and Norway
Norway &apos;s prime minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ Ã¸r@@ ge Br@@ ing have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
the relationship between China and Norway went to Sto@@ cks , after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian government rus@@ hed to do so that this is ultimately nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were continued until December last year . only in June , Norway signed an agreement to resume the sal@@ mon trip to China since the exports since 2010 were largely blocked .
once the message had spread that Li@@ u was serious , the Nobel committee brought its hope for a unconditional release to express and lu@@ d li@@ u to pick its prize in Oslo .
due to its adher@@ ence , he was not able to counter his prize .
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a decision to liber@@ ate Li@@ u and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support where he wants .
the peak diplom@@ ats of the EU , Federica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , demanded China also for the release of Li@@ us on how to take part in an explanation at the 30th of June :
at the same time , we expect China to elev@@ ates all restrictions of Mr Li@@ us wife and family members .
they shall meet and receive all the visits they wish , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
United States of America
&quot; &quot; &quot; us Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad shared with that the Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wish him that he has the possibility of treatment abroad , in this respect it may help him in his recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ person in the U.S. Embassy in China , Mary and Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AF@@ P on 27 June , announced that the message to release the Chinese authorities not just free Li@@ u , but also to liber@@ ate his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia of her house arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the request of the U.S. message attracted an angry answer from China , with the utter@@ ance of the State Department that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country have the right to interven@@ e and un@@ answered remarks about Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley told that China should offer the couple :
protection and freedom such as freedom of movement and access to the medical care of his choice , which they claim according to the Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations .
the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz have also introduced a vote in the Congress to push the Chinese government to pushing , Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condi@@ tionally .
I urge China to release the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ condi@@ tionally so that he can move into a proper medical treatment . htt@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German government spokes@@ man St@@ effen Sei@@ bert wrote on 3 July , Berlin hope that Li@@ u &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; received all the medical support he needs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chinese President Xi J@@ in@@ ping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg .
previously reported diplomatic sources in Beijing of the news agency Re@@ uters that China had great concerns if the vor@@ tex could be over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed by Li@@ u &apos;s visit to Hamburg .
Canada
on 28 June , the Canadian ambass@@ ador John Mc@@ Call@@ um China called on to provide appropriate medical care and give him the opportunity to worry about his family .
Li@@ us An@@ walt told AF@@ P previously that Li@@ us wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , who could visit him every day , but the police have always been able to visit the room in the hospital and that it is Li@@ u not permitted with someone outside , including his lawyers , speak and contact .
Mc@@ Call@@ um tells on :
Canada demands China to liber@@ ate its international human rights , including freedom of expression , to preserve and liber@@ ate the rights for the exercise of these rights .
France
France &apos;s State Department called for China in an Declaration on 29 June to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receive all treatments which he , regardless of where , requires . furthermore , his wife and family may have contact to him .
although the news station France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the State Department announced that there is no further information that France will eventually take him .
Taiwan
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of the mainland affairs in Taiwan called on 27 June to release Li@@ u and to demonstrate a greater tolerance to those seeking peaceful means to promote political reforms and democratic development . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese Legisl@@ ative legis@@ lators , Yu Me@@ i @-@ nu by the ruling Democratic Pro@@ gress Party , China also called on to allow the sick intellectual li@@ u to treat themselves in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed himself very worried in an explanation on 28 June by Li@@ u and gave that many have asked him to pray for Li@@ us well @-@ being .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my faith that the initiatives he took and for which he was strictly pun@@ ished , to a harmonious , stabil@@ ising and aff@@ lu@@ ous of China , which in turn would have contributed to a peaceful world .
I felt personally very moved and encouraged , when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the Charter 08 signed , which stands for democracy , freedom and the rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .
license : C@@ C@@ 0 Dom@@ aine Public
is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stupid since Singapore is recognized at an international level as an independent state .
but according to the Minister of Justice , K. Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am should be considered as a city .
this observation has triggered a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osph@@ ere .
during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branches of the State Chamber of New York , the minister noted that many people critici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared with other countries .
he support Singapore as a city should be considered .
... nobody asked whether New York is a democracy ...
this is what most people make a mistake .
I tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the logic to ban &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and attach@@ ments to create this valuable country , one hear that we will ultimately be no country .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the semb@@ lance of a flight before the responsibilities , a mandatory infringement .
Singapore if you are not my country , eat country then ?
the reasons mentioned by Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am were not very no@@ ble : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries , given it , he appeared un@@ democratic .
in contrast , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently run by a party .
these cities are democratic .
once you reach the core point of the topic , the good old glue emerges from the author@@ itarian rulers to pret@@ end Democrats , leaving logic , because it fits better to their power .
in the final effect , the very last week of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am gave answers to his American guests with regard to our press , our youth @-@ dict@@ ative , our political system really non @-@ responses .
appropriate questions tar@@ ded with non @-@ responses to rational way .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls for Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am to clear his opinion , since they did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country , but a city is , so which country belongs to our city ...
in short , I understand nothing .
I would be very grateful if our dear K Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am would take the effort to clarify this point unless he was paid for , to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
by clicking on the blog he has published his comments on the reviews that you should begin to read the entire co @-@ ordin@@ ance of the conference , in order to better understand the context of the statements of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am , according to which Singapore is a city and no country .
read the trans@@ cription .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore is rather a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said why the elections in Singapore would be so un@@ important , even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he lived Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said , Singapore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was not a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has obviously not meant to be in this sense . &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ lement T@@ an shows his disappointment about Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am , who makes a leader of a growing generation , such a pol@@ em@@ ic statement .
I am talking about what the Minister of Justice Minister of Singapore has said , ...
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the Old Guard , what I do - whether I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am , member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes that he really believes and aware of what he def@@ ends .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ben@@ ch@@ belie@@ ver has committed a mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was it a mis@@ leading speaker ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Singapore is not a country , we are only considered an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , on which country go back the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore ?
Singapore is unique , it is equal to land and city .
as he plays an important role within the government of the government , the statements of Mr. Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am is of hard@@ est importance .
why do the sanc@@ tify their military service , they only defend their city but not their land ?
whom must our Prime Minister rep@@ ay invo@@ ices ?
what is the value of our pink stem ?
are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade zur Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore is and was always a city :
&quot; I have not told what I said ... &quot;
this set seems to have been anno@@ yed as much as possible ...
nobody has ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defending the country above all &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but that is not quite true . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .
the myth of the &quot; cute Kan@@ adi@@ ers &quot;
Canadian N@@ ed Fl@@ anders .
scre@@ enshot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices asked about his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect in your home country or home country ?
their answers will be published here as part of a continuing series , with rum@@ ors of certain parts of the world , and another fac@@ et is to be shown .
the latest part of this series is from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the question that is most asked for me in Japan is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are you American ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; no , I am sorry , &quot; answered I then . &quot; I am from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I am living in Japan and again in Japan .
depending on the situation the conversation takes place , it is considered pol@@ itely to show interest in his inter@@ loc@@ utor by putting personal questions .
in my mind , then the default answer then follows : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , Eis@@ ho@@ ckey , Nature . &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans might be in@@ war@@ dly in@@ war@@ dly especially when they are held for Americans but don &apos;t distur@@ bs me that .
for anyone who does not know himself , there is little that distingu@@ ishes us Can@@ adi@@ ans from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans are well visible on their back@@ pack when travelling .
all dear Can@@ adi@@ ans .
Americans however ... .
so it was already when I started travelling 20 years ago , through the world - before Donald Tru@@ mp , before the invasion of Iraq and the 11th September .
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always worn small A@@ hor@@ n@@ als at their baggage to differentiate themselves from their American neighbors .
we have a free health care !
with us there is no weapons !
gender @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
all seem to think , Canada is so great .
we are polite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we obviously say very often &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada also counts as the toler@@ ant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not as these types south of the border .
we Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate this .
first , I have many American friends , which I admired .
there would be nothing wrong with me if one would change me with Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are also some problems with the stamp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; first , as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; is basically to be spar@@ se - just like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle , but tragic , un@@ important figure N@@ ed Fl@@ anders from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Simp@@ son &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( who has one &apos;s own Canadian double lon@@ er ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Canada was really a nation full of people like N@@ ed Fl@@ anders , this would be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; no personality has .
there are no corners and edges , nothing in which you can encounter .
being harmless , means un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive and un@@ interesting and no attention to deserve .
this may be something good , if you want un@@ noticed in the background , remote from the things that happen around a around .
I would even go far to say that the desire to be free and alone , a main peculi@@ ar of the Can@@ adi@@ ans is .
we tend to take care of our own affairs only .
what out@@ si@@ ders as &quot; nice , &quot; is perhaps simply cool courtesy .
Can@@ adi@@ ans are not often talking about the fence along with the neighbors .
we lack warm , open friendliness that I have now connecting with my American friends .
fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) then Jus@@ tin Tru@@ de@@ au went the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada almost sexy .
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ o@@ ded Thailand &apos;s Jun@@ ta
one in Thailand famous pop @-@ band has released a music video which took the power of the Jun@@ ta , which led the power of the Jun@@ ta and to restore the country in spite of their promises to continue the country .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) The Band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells about which rules makes him his girlfriend .
although not expressly politically , the music video refers directly to the continued military rule of the Jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the country &apos;s situation .
the video to the song was a huge success .
in the first three days it was shared on Facebook uploaded Video 1.@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8,@@ 800 Li@@ kes .
last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video , &quot; The dict@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists open the public to watch this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , as special as it beha@@ ves with the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta domination .
look at once these shots of the video , which refer to some of the political issues that Thailand per@@ sec@@ uted in the past three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refer to the dra@@ in section 44 of the provisional Constitution , which makes an absolute decision @-@ making through important national issues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th rule : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change your attitude &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the in@@ appropriate program for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; setup &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other individuals who are regarded by the Jun@@ ta as critics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the image above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose v@@ age and un@@ clear rules are often used by the authorities to compens@@ ate activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was set up in the army , monitored on the online content and individuals who are thrown , the monarchy is per@@ sec@@ uted and prosec@@ uted .
Thailand is putting a stri@@ ction against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ estic re@@ mun@@ er@@ ation ) .
the war was established in Thailand on 20 May 2014 .
two days later it came to a put@@ sch of the army .
one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to be prosec@@ uted , their decision to buy expensive U @-@ boats , although safety specialists they warned that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money .
in the video even shown how individuals will be thrown into a black delivery car before you bring them into an interval camp , a further problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some journalists are in prison , because they are supposedly causing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confusion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society and are threatened with Internet users , they should ins@@ ulting the monarchy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile the te@@ aser of the band members of the band , which was used the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , who was already used by put@@ sch enemies during protests in 2014 .
life goes on in the ruins of the violin cities in the eastern part of East Asia

the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the OC Media website and published here with friendly permission .
the post @-@ war company reco@@ vering only very slowly in East @-@ East Asia , especially in the district T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
it has now been over 20 years since the Georgian @-@ ab@@ ian war was officially ended , but its s@@ cars are still visible in this part of the Republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern districts in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking images .
villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ kh@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and Khar@@ kov are located in the carbon basin of Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , de@@ preci@@ ation , Geor@@ gi@@ ers and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together in the area together .
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
today , the largest part of the Russians and settlements live in the area .
such settlements are also called violin towns in Ab@@ ch@@ Asia .
in the pre @-@ war period there are more than 10,000 people , today there are only a few hundred people in these host@@ ages .
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the overall population of the district was 16@@ ,000 people after having risen over a decade .
1989 approximately 4@@ 3.000 people lived in this district .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the empty five @-@ story flo@@ ats of the Soviet Union from the early 60@@ s , called the chron@@ icles , stand symbo@@ lic@@ ally for the decline and the devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are fallen and quite rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , I met a native older man .
he begins a conversation and it falls him hard to end this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; why talk ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is nevertheless unique . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in front of the war the village was full of life .
there were community centres , schools and kinder@@ gartens who served all the community .
now there is only paved road with remaining magnific@@ ence buildings .
the people who once lived on this place and made their contribution to the central economy of the Soviet Union , have now left the district .
in the violin town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , approximately fifty inhabitants live .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the chron@@ icles , which are still one or two families , one recognizes the balconies where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me with the camera in hand , they immediately move back .
&quot; our mother made us forbidden that we let ourselves photograph , &quot; says one of the girls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has just forbidden us , that is all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers their friend something to and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small tur@@ quoise mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence ( cultivation of agricultural products for self @-@ demand ) such as livestock farming , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable construction .
it is difficult to get to the rounds .
the District Management provides free candles and bread to the villages in winter .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ cch@@ ini &quot;
about ten years ago an older woman moved with the name Gal@@ ina ( or a@@ unt G@@ alya &apos;s as she is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to jungle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite their oldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina has not left off @-@ East Asia to live with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ ch@@ asia &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she tells them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gal@@ ina would not want to accept financial assistance from her daughter and insi@@ sts that she is supporting her young grand@@ son .
Gal@@ inas monthly r@@ ents are just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she gives her . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a@@ unt G@@ alya is told she and other vill@@ agers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman and a young family and I live in this building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when holidays are , we visit us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but we cannot do this constantly - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while she tells her story , a younger neigh@@ bor appears on the balcony .
&quot; Nat@@ asha , &quot; calls T@@ ante G@@ alya her to . &quot; you said , we could build zu@@ cch@@ ini .
I have already prepared the ground .
I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as talks with her husband and the five common children lived in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she reminded of the mit@@ es in front of the war .
despite the relatives , which live in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the land Ab@@ ch@@ Asia broke away ) , they didn &apos;t have the opportunity to leave it .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative division in Central Asia ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but that will still take something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ ascha receives about $ 9 children &apos;s money for every child .
your husband works in the K@@ ohl@@ eng@@ pit .
the young family has their own farm .
near the house where Nat@@ asch@@ as kinder@@ garten once was , they hold pigs , cows , h@@ amm@@ ers and chickens .
it tells us that it was first a very frigh@@ tening situation when many people left the village after the war .
but over time it lost their dist@@ resses .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark street or the few people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
but actually it has something to do with pl@@ under@@ tak@@ ings .
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived as it was right .
I remember every day like the city and the war once were . &quot;
when our conversation goes to the end , a little boy was over to us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hidden .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy hun@@ ted to him .
he plays with the ball that envel@@ opes the hill .
a group of children now scre@@ am writing the ball .
while they run , some of them throw stones on the fallen building .
these ruins are part of their childhood , which ensure imm@@ ac@@ tness in their lives .
they do not know it differently .

in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; migrants &quot; home on her long journey
Concep@@ ciÃ³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez guides a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the State of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by Amy Br@@ acken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and will be published here with friendly permission .
on the path of migrants that Europe or Latin America cross , certain places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located on the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is led by a 5@@ 9@@ - year old , a small woman with a cor@@ als with cor@@ als with cor@@ als and gold @-@ colored ear@@ rings in Ted@@ dy@@ b@@ Ã¤ren form .
it is called Concep@@ ciÃ³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name of Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is the fact that the hotel ( or rather they have become a target for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ ti@@ ans who are on the journey .
the hotel does not have any charm .
for about 2.@@ 50 dollars the night sleep the guests in simple rooms , with cold , cru@@ mb@@ ling walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rots in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - yet there are hundreds of African and ha@@ i@@ ti@@ anic migrants here .
sometimes , Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez , the people come in full small buses and from the upper part of the coast begin to call her : &quot; Mama Africa !
where are you Mama Africa ? &quot;
at the moment it is rather quiet but this year Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have already slept on the map .
it does not want to reject anyone .
she also helps them and brings them to hospital when they are sick , they buy them drugs they may not pay , they mass@@ aged them with a bal@@ m that exhausted from the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has recently arrived .
I asked him if Mama Africa is a reasonable nick@@ name for Mrs Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the Family Sebasti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ ry ) with Concep@@ ciÃ³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Br@@ acken .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; answers with a smile . &quot; I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women .
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister who hopes to go to Boston to find her husband and the three children .
they have already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to make normal a first stop in South America and then move towards north .
the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well known name on the track , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a Guest from Haiti .
he tells us that the Hai@@ tian and the Afri@@ cans often travel together the way and that Afri@@ cans are already talking to W@@ hat@@ s@@ app of Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
how many of his Way@@ showers , Michel@@ et has lived in Brazil before and worked as construction workers on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the football championship .
when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he has started his journey into the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money in order to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will contact Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let them go again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he sm@@ el@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always stay in contact . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez told that their guests often send text messages if they have gone to kiss them or to report her about the course of their journey .
it declares that their Christian faith in the drive of their work is .
she does not know much about Africa , but their guests have brought her to prepare chickens as in Ghana .
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but it is not the only spark of hope for migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city there is a dead end to Jes@@ Ãº@@ s of Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
in this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have started migrants in her little house .
he is pol@@ z@@ ist and found that the bus tickets are sold to numerous African immigrants .
he has begun to help them get a reasonable price , then he has offered them his house for one dollar the night .
at the moment 25 people are there , mainly Hai@@ tian .
some sleeping on ceilings on the ground , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests are doing .
&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; he tells . &quot; I experienced what they experience .
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people can help and others do not help . that &apos;s the reason why I give them my support . &quot;
after having lived for three years , he was transferred to a raid on his labour market from the United States .
the majority of migrants that travels through Tap@@ ach@@ ula , comes from Central America , other inhabitants also open the doors of their homes for them .
JosÃ© Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ Ã©n@@ dez told me that he fled to people in Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to press money from him without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for an accommodation and a unknown , one all@@ u@@ stom@@ ed , has offered him their roof .
a few months later , the family still lives there and they tried to decide where the next steps should go .
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests .
in the courses we consult their phones quietly .
a minibus has arrived today and has 20 new guests , a large part of Somalia .
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gi@@ cally , because of those who have gone .
as a proud grand@@ mother she bl@@ ush her in her album with numerous photos .
there are one of her daughter with African hair spots that you made a customer in , some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more , boy and Old .
they laugh at the heart of them while they briefly present it to me .
&quot; Ya &quot; fu@@ eron &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; repeated every time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have already gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang inhabitants are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones .
a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang from Twitter users , have given us ...
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , a ethnic minorities in the west of China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones .
on July 10 , the mobile users of the Tian@@ shan District of the City of Uru@@ m@@ qi received a cell messages in which it indicates the District government to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cleaning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the communication is said that the app will be entitled to access terrorist information &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but k@@ Ã²@@ s the authorities also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous I@@ li Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ fecture , because they had already installed the app , messages with a private We@@ chat group .
in the communication of the police force that the app would determine the sources and the distribution paths of terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , pictures , e@@ books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gs website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om .
the main function is the block@@ age of por@@ no@@ graphic websites , from online sc@@ ams , Tro@@ jan and ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online , and to control the own home network .
this app with filtering for min@@ ors should help the children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
for example , the &quot; remote &quot; state actors or even h@@ ackers could manipul@@ ate the home network of a person or to ste@@ al it .
this introduction is consistent with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
while noti@@ fications about digital cens@@ or@@ ship in China mostly focus on the experience of users in larger cities in the east and south , the reality is very often dark for those who live in distant , oppressed ethnic minorities such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in the conflic@@ ting areas , the authorities often arrange extreme cens@@ ors and monitoring measures as well as rout@@ in@@ ous Internet termin@@ ations .
the news based on Twitter @-@ based media out@@ let &quot; Images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( which was posted by a Check@@ point ) , showed photos of a check@@ point , at the police officers , subsequently over@@ checked whether they had installed the surveillance app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian ensure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification demanded that the people will install the app within 10 days .
if you are detected at a check@@ point using a device without this software , they could be det@@ ained up to 10 days .
this is a return for technological development .
they have been forced to use the people who are meant for older people to use .
this is a form of bondage through rest technology .
we are back in ma@@ os China .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; images from Main@@ land China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Queen of Main@@ land China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description from which the software can lift the password requirement of a Windows operating system and thus receives un@@ restricted access to the hard drive of the computer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computer and mobile phones are used in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang to electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the provisions in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang are potentially a reaction to the instructions of the city party Council to minimize the dissemination of illegal content .
all governmental entities , authorities and the party connected institutions including universities and research institutions are obligated to follow the instructions of Cyber@@ security office when operating their computers and communication devices .
a current report by Freedom House , a U.S. American human rights organization , mentioned also these new monitoring methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published on 27 June in a district of regional capital of Uru@@ m@@ qi , a regulation with the statement to all the residents and entrepreneurs , until 1 August their &quot; personal ID cards , phones , external drives , portable disks , not@@ ebooks and media cards &quot; to register in local police .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the intention is obviously any &quot; terrorist &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to identify and destroy any &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrorist videos &quot; &quot; &quot; . however , this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of Uru@@ m@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for quite a number of other possible off@@ ences , including those who refer to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot; &quot; &quot;

everything has dissolved itself and reveals a truth that is clearly visible , both inside and outside .
one that makes their name all glory .
one that has cr@@ ush@@ ed in a list of feelings and expressions that does not allow met@@ aph@@ ors .
but if you get the reality again and you get behind the scenes - beyond the act@@ s , the beautiful scenes and the performer - turn into the characters of flesh and blood , and all cry unto death .
all doubts solve in smoke and you will become aware of your existence , even if Earth continues on the axis of the we@@ dge . you will realize that you are tr@@ apped here between the walls , who have built your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone around stone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have arrested me and my father three times , but that was not yet to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my lesson , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the leader of the security service it form@@ ulate - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he presented his power over us by giving even the simplest concepts that we knew .
five teenagers were killed during a peaceful protests like we@@ eds from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
it came out so that the city cr@@ ashed the darkness of the night with &quot; All @-@ ahu ac@@ bar . &quot;
all city districts sought after only my own .
for the first time it was quiet , reg@@ ression , at the wrong time , even though I had no high demands on a city that has been op@@ ted to the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces .
in the third night things had cal@@ med things down after the power supply in the neighborhood had to work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I broke the silence by crying out several times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ahu &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from my house @-@ roof . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice through the silence res@@ ists .
few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to find together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we were talking to a beautiful image that ful@@ fills my expectations .
in such a moment you become aware that you are free the spirit from the lamp , but it is just not interested in smell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; makes you ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he put on .
then I learned the following : regardless of how much honey you can swal@@ low , nothing can give you your voice , after you have forgotten them all the way up to the office of the security service from the body .
I came there .
the Ober@@ st Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I now also .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ober@@ st Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to speak : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let &apos;s hear me as you &apos;re &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ahu &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or you are only brave enough to cry , if we are not near . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; me@@ gab@@ ytes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lay up on me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you mour@@ ned for you what to look into the eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then did nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building .
perhaps it was on my tor@@ ment , van@@ ity , and perhaps at the revolution .
I was so safe to me , when I said , &quot; I would not have thought that you have forgotten my voice again since yesterday .
and I think , I have never stopped to look into the eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I regret not a word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a single and his father right away with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father is equal to this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bases of this curse is to me now in the nose .
he became a &quot; syndrome , &quot; a spiritual torture , who I was exposed to month .
I cry out the yard .
in the first office I leave everything I am tra@@ ded with me .
afterwards , through the farm and into the second office , which leads through a hallway to the single cells .
I prepared all the details exactly before I sat down the room .
otherwise than otherwise they probably have shared a larger cell .
I have to share it with only one single other prisoners and may contact me immediately without waiting for their permission .
after a few minutes , who felt like a whole life , the official left the cell , and I handle an old proven communication method : using the fist to beat the wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my z@@ g@@ gling was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ sth@@ and &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he answered me finally .
apparently , in no one of the surrounding cells was a prestigious man middle aged who looks like me and called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in perfect darkness , there cannot be seen any mark@@ ers to me , and doctors are not here ; we are all only numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds like my sounds ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the answers have its existence .
perhaps he was moved to one of the great cells .
perhaps he will immediately listen .
the investig@@ ator had assured me , they would be fre@@ il@@ ant when I stay .
liar .
I would like to have had a bird @-@ shy to exp@@ el all these cro@@ ws who lab@@ elled to the fruits in the garden of my head .
from a distance I still hear them &quot; All @-@ ahu ac@@ bar . &quot;
it has to be about 10 am in the evening ; always about this time the hor@@ rors , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black the colour of failure is , until I saw the yellow light that presented us the Gre@@ ys in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; stop on 13th S@@ ure des Kor@@ an ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are here to hear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this , the secret was ins@@ ulated : to protect the state security before us and preventing the terrorists into us , they speak in al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dialect and thus they played their con@@ fession@@ al appearance and ri@@ pped the narrow eye @-@ field of its world view .
this is not a house , which is here is no country ; it is a curse which they call coexistence to transform the crimin@@ als of their cl@@ ans into a hero .
I cared for the audi@@ tor and meet on Abu Ima@@ d , a sl@@ ender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he comes to me so .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he begins a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; despite the faces &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life than to protest this diary and protest to demonstrations that will soon find an end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not answer .
I acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to it , not to answer .
I can really no longer say exactly when ins@@ ults and pun@@ ots have become a friendly conversation for me to become an ordinary communication .
when and how that happened , was un@@ important .
any voice in me said that I had to get used to get used to be pun@@ ished , although I had done nothing to earn this punishment .
a penalty in all its diversity .
his command is to tear myself as much meat as possible from the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he calls the loving &quot; con@@ fession . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe that probably comes from the clo@@ ak .
thy Hen@@ ker rejo@@ iced to your cry .
give him the pleasure , you cannot measure you with it , and you cannot with@@ hold your hor@@ rors .
my terror were not yet enough , why they inter@@ changeable the pipe through a cable .
during my first arrest , I asked if the investig@@ ator had worked as a gar@@ bage dump , or if it belonged to normal labour equipment .
they had four cables inter@@ woven around us to present the ones from their view , great invention of a huge cab@@ al .
within a single hour , three of them change , while I was still in the row .
I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice , why I listened to scre@@ am .
the Hen@@ ker noted the cooling and did not find any vessel at all , which is why it is taken as a neighbour to an electri@@ cally invited .
flow flow@@ ed to provide my entire body enough to store my entire quarter .
my semi @-@ cris@@ p body , spread out on the ground was the perfect electric ladder .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was there again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
it must have been so at midnight .
I decided to put me again again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
some hours passed that came to me like minutes .
then the call for the morning prayer .
the door opens and the brightness meets the room &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fic@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I answered with the voice of an exhaustive teen@@ ager : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my lord , my father must be fear@@ ful worry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; be silent and away you , you will move . &quot;
this was new .
otherwise they always had me released .
where do they lead me ? !
the j@@ ord@@ an R@@ apper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b talks about the rights of LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b spends most of his time in@@ doors ; sometimes he s@@ cour@@ ges to his screen , sometimes to his computer , and again to his couch .
but what you can leave , is a cigarette between his fingers or his with nicotine to discover lips .
he lives in the top floor of his family house , which has been part of them since 1967 ; in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs family had comp@@ elled to escape from their village in Palestine in which they had lived as rocky ( about : Far@@ mer ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for six years H@@ ai@@ b is a passionate activ@@ ist who faces the conservative majority and asks her native opinions on gender roles , sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ music . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with his music , often deals with topics such as Orient@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , but also calls for the core of the entire Arab world . all these topics do not only find in his hom@@ etown Am@@ man relevance , but also in cities that range from Damascus in Syria to San@@ aa in Yemen .
with its 25 years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees himself as someone who is not restricted in his mind by borders , and may according to his own statement with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he does not give it openly , he swe@@ pt up against the American foreign policy a special bow .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b does not believe that his sympathy for those who try to survive in war areas , to do anything with his identity as a &quot; Palestinian wing@@ ed of second generation , &quot; even if he was born in Jordan , and has never been in Palestine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think of my own life circumstances so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed H@@ d@@ ai@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then he adds : &quot; I think so , because I am a man , &quot; while in water sol@@ sti@@ sts it in two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan . in this time it is intended for Muslims , from sunrise to sunset .
the j@@ ord@@ anic law also states that public consumption of food is illegal during the Ram@@ adan .
obviously , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee on a sen@@ sing hot Jun@@ it@@ ag has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically , the gap of warm coffee and the s@@ ali@@ ent of the K@@ ent cigarette in the nose is first and foremost of freedom .
sometimes Jordan like a prison feels like a prison in the open sky , especially when looking at a view to neighbouring countries .
of therefore , it is easy to do basic things - as to drink in public during the Ram@@ adan water - to not land in prison .
recently , the interior of the Department of Jord@@ anian has canc@@ eled a appearance of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a , already for the second time .
some parliam@@ ent@@ arians who support the Islamic Action Front - the j@@ ord@@ al branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual side of Ham@@ ed sensu@@ o , the cultural and traditional norms of the country contradi@@ cts and the main reason for the concert .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the S &amp; D spokes@@ woman in the Islamic coalition of DI@@ MA Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that had been told the concert &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the sexual orientation of the slave . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many claim , the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world be more dangerous activ@@ ism , which represents the old approved legitimacy of author@@ itarian regimes in the entire region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a did the j@@ ord@@ al people as &quot; progressive suppor@@ ter of human rights , &quot; which continues to stand for an intellectual and cultural plur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement probably might not be just sil@@ lu@@ ous rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic but in fact , a more and more clear reality is reflected in Jordan , which occurs in H@@ ai@@ bs &apos;s work clearly .
in 2016 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b traditional Gender nor@@ men to Lei@@ be , trying to portra@@ y his vision of the fate of Arabic women who have failed sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an apparently down @-@ known woman whose arms and legs stretch themselves up to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who really should trust .
over the past years , the number of &quot; volunteers &quot; has increased in Jordan - the in@@ official outside .
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of volunteers in 2016 reached their peak ; however , the institutional infrastructure is lacking in order to support the women , the victims tried murder or domestic violence have become reasonable .
according to a law for breaking down the year 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence , &quot; at un@@ determined time in prison , &quot; and for their release is often a years of bureaucratic effort , as well as the guarantee of the family necessary that the woman has nothing to happen .
also H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs Music enjoys great popularity and is known for it , do not shy away from issues that are long as tab@@ u in his country .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b shows that his work is political , however , that he is his music , the full of explicit quotes on sexuality , freedom and expression cannot be separated from politics .
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he was a policy of politics &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a song called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b takes the question of the Palestinian identity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the focus on poverty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the list of the songs that are politically politically , can be continued .
in March 2016 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b published a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated often :
&quot; you are free , and any other is it too . &quot;
in the further course of the song H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a kind of market , on which one can get in his words , &quot; what you want &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ faith , h@@ et@@ ero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality .
he notices that hardly anyone talks to Jordan on the rights of gay and les@@ bi@@ ans and that comments on equality of LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals were still heavily cens@@ ored in 2014 .
in 2014 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b resulted in an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ al Online@@ Programme Ro@@ ya to remember that his comments were scr@@ apped from the context , and had been cens@@ ored in his opinion .
&quot; on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts , but it was only a processed version , &quot; he says .
today H@@ d@@ ai@@ b acqu@@ ires H@@ d@@ ai@@ b open for the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that intolerance towards homosexu@@ als do not speak to Islam .
he mentioned Abu Nu@@ clear , a poet of the eighth century that has remained in memory even today thanks to its homo@@ erotic poetry .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ clear that later once on behalf of the cali@@ ph should work to write in the eighth century openly about homosexu@@ ality , why can Jord@@ an@@ ier that not ?
the real problem , so h@@ d@@ ai@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ i@@ tic kingdom there is nothing new more that the government attack attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced .
recently , in January 2017 , the j@@ ord@@ al message service took several former government @-@ level and members of the teacher &apos;s association , with the reason , they have expressed cri@@ tically on the comments in social media , which coinci@@ ded with the deeply rooted in the land of corruption .
in view of what is the concert H@@ d@@ ai@@ b opinion , only the tip of the ic@@ eberg - the real challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ an@@ ier .
for him , progress is a permanent giving and taking . Jordan has rep@@ lied M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - it is H@@ d@@ ai@@ b - consists of slow , precious and inner changes . it is certain that these changes take place from day to day at the heart of the j@@ ord@@ al society .
ultimately , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , also , from a Arab world without interventions from abroad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he dre@@ aming not only of it , his work until Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the region will deal with music , art and literature of genuine and basic openness - and not by bom@@ bs , stretching and artificial kind , and at least he hopes that .
until it is far , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b will continue and therefore also res@@ ist .

Neb@@ uta is one of the three largest festivals in Japan .
these large , extravag@@ ant warri@@ ors are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
we suspected that it is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of To@@ ho@@ cus . another theory means that the strongh@@ old , the drums and dancing over more than a thousand years have been handed over to the north @-@ east to force the indigenous people of the region , the Em@@ ishi to force into the knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we could make a few great seats , so we have a great view .
one can only imagine how big these parts are ...
a joint centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , hosted an two @-@ month exhibition to W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally .
I saw myself again the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en again for a long time : two trol@@ le@@ ys are just to be seen .
nevertheless it is for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori to take the Neb@@ uta festival the only truth - and to spend a wonderful way in this summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Sommer@@ festival in the north of the country .
I was there and looked at the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 meter high hill was incredible .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !

rarely were outer appearance and body care so important as in this story , as they help preserve the Peruvian youth from the crime and to promote a legitimate profession like those of the hair@@ styles .
El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where street ro@@ b and illegal drugs are all@@ ot@@ ted daily .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe .
at the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , appearance and thus also the fancy hair@@ styles of famous sports@@ men like Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( Chile ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led to become more and more norm@@ alized into the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers that can make these elaborate hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles that go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of the hair@@ dres@@ ses of your &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been held since 2014 .
there are experts to join each other to show who can be able to create the most ec@@ cent@@ ric layout , as you can see in the following video ( more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , found here in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to persu@@ ade young people from them to find their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools , and instead of bad ratings to receive a training in hair@@ dressing art that allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the offering opportunities have seen do@@ zens of young people that they can take a profession which is currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops before the end of March , and reported on some of their successes :
in 1995 we were the only university school in the community and the district , where we are very proud , because of love for the children we have established this educational community .
Colombia : love fe@@ ather to guer@@ ri@@ lla warfare
photo : Valentina Mon@@ sal@@ ve .
use with friendly permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the following article is the edited version of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; love message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guer@@ ri@@ lla warfare &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which has published the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contribution will be published here in a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write only love for people who we know ?
is it not yet much more important , people who feel embarrass@@ ed with affection ?
exactly this question went to the two young Colom@@ bian activists from the foundation of Bogot@@ a and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation , no more from the head and inspired it to the campaign Cart@@ as por la Re@@ conci@@ li@@ aciÃ³n ( letters to reconciliation ) to write young people to write guer@@ ri@@ lla warfare .
only recently , her country &apos;s show@@ room of a historical event and they wanted to contribute to their part : after years of talks , the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guer@@ ri@@ lla F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary forces of Kolum@@ ba ) , which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
international was considered the submission of peace agreement as so significant that the Colom@@ bian President JosÃ© Manuel San@@ tos was awarded for his merits for the Nobel Peace Prize .
but in front of the Colum@@ bi@@ ans , there is still a long way until you can speak of a real reconciliation and peace .
guer@@ ri@@ lla warfare that have been living in illegal camps for many years , had been exposed to war rh@@ rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic and brought up their weapons around the clock to integrate themselves into life as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society in turn , who had acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to life in constant fear and in some cases deeply hatred of guer@@ ri@@ lla warfare has now to record them into their ranks and assist them in building a new life .
Leonardo and Cr@@ istian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bian was joined together and would need to help with the integration process .
and this is exactly what they did : until now , thousands of young people have written letters - love message to former guer@@ ri@@ lla warfare in order to welcome them back in society .
the aim of the campaign are 6@@ 900 letters - one for any former guer@@ ri@@ lla warfare that should be handed over personally .
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the letters of reconciliation arose at the world summit of the Nobel Peace Prize , who took place in Bogot@@ Ã¡ in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cr@@ istian had the opportunity to talk to K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ ar@@ thi who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this explained that we love the human who we love , write on Valent@@ ine &apos;s day thousands of love , but those forgot they need much unnecessary .
he plan , he told him to share his love with people this year , the most urgent need .
so the plan was to write letters of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC , who now find their place in society and have to build up a new life . &quot; the letters will show that Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history to a common history of peace , &quot; they say .
until now , more than 2000 letters have been collected within the framework of the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia like Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ Ã­n , Barran@@ qu@@ illa and Bogot@@ Ã¡ .
&apos;@@ i never thought that someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over on 19 March in one of the UN camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca .
a group of 40 students at the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the foundation of Bogot@@ a travelled to the camp to over@@ take the letters personally .
the members of the F@@ ARC set up as they had done before to counter the prec@@ ep@@ ts of their leaders .
but this time they received no prec@@ ep@@ ts , but letters of sub @-@ protecting people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for all involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings you can go through just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between , &quot; told the political knowledge @-@ student Manuela Jim@@ Ã©@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , an employee of the governor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience :
after we had passed the letters , a former warri@@ or led me through the camp of guer@@ illa @-@ fighters .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of cottage , in which the guer@@ ri@@ lla war live ) saw I saw a guer@@ ri@@ lla warfare that wrote something .
I was afraid to enter , because beside him on the bed there was an M@@ GL @-@ pom@@ eg@@ ram , a deadly weapon in the thorn @-@ pipe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I still spoke it and asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hello , what do they just ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answering a letter that someone wrote to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hope@@ ful letter .
never before in my life someone has written a bit so beautiful , so I rep@@ ented to it . &quot; there I suddenly hit the tears about the che@@ eks .
I embr@@ aced him very firm and set me next to the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ers .
perhaps he was sorry to the war , was sorry to be all the years of faithful companions of this fighters and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he never had anything else from life expect@@ edly than war . he had never imagined the F@@ ARC , was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers before the hunger strike . &quot; I never thought someone would be for@@ given me for my fault .
but now I know that there is a society out there that wa@@ its with open arms for us .
until now I learned just how to deal with weapons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now where peace reigns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new voices
for pr@@ el@@ ude , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC came together to a discussion round .
the students were all grown up as war and the F@@ ARC already acted in hiding .
that is why the leaders of the F@@ ARC , the history of the organization , their ideals , and gave insights into their views on the peace process : &quot; many years have experienced how social injustice we have the opportunity to develop into a political party , we can help to make the society more equ@@ itable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a purpose of this scale , it is worth to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manuela was impressed :
to hear these people who had never heard heard and had no choice right now , and to realize that people who have often seen as a mon@@ ster and even hate , even people with beautiful feelings were converted by their living conditions and their environment was very painful for me .
the reality in which the land lives , does me hurt .
but it comfor@@ ted me that all men - also those who have killed and so much damage caused us to teach us something and give a smile and a hug .
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
Gust@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez , the command@@ ant of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , for example Dar@@ Ã­o de Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Arch@@ bishop of the city of Cal@@ i , the following letter :
the Colom@@ bian was proph@@ esi@@ ed , that after the dis@@ armament peace would rule .
but this is not the case .
as long as inequality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities there will always be people who are prepared to take up arms and to protest to their rights . and that is also completely justified ( ... ) .
we of the F@@ ARC are now putting on peace , to a policy without arms .
that is why we call all defen@@ ders of peace - no matter which race , religion or ideology they listen - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and bringing sacrifices , as we know from our own experience , that nothing is simply . those among us who defend life as the basis of existence will become many difficulties .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .

hom@@ os@@ exual and que@@ er people who live in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region , are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
with fri@@ ght activists have experienced the reporting of the last few months on the persecution of sul@@ try men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat that is like a D@@ amo@@ is worth over the dor@@ m LGB@@ T@@ Q community is not only formed over night .
OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny who has shared some of their experiences with us and spoken with us about what is happening in the Republic .
the LGB@@ T@@ Q @-@ legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has conquered the international head@@ lines after several months after reports have been published , the deteri@@ or@@ ations , torture and killing que@@ er men in the Republic .
the first report was published by the journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Now@@ aya Gas@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities , the susp@@ ects que@@ er men Festival and they were in secret pr@@ isons in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; you have brought a mon@@ ster to the world &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a Trans@@ wife , was born in Gros@@ ny , and grew up there .
already since her childhood she sen@@ sed that she was a woman in reality .
when she grew up , you become aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for them , why she moved to Moscow .
after a group of Ch@@ echn@@ yan was experienced by the gender equality of their land@@ lady , hunting was opened on Sab@@ rina .
fear for her life she moved to the United States in the end .
Sab@@ rina : I was active as a volunteer hel@@ per in a human rights organisation .
one day was told me that someone needed my help .
it was a friend of D@@ ag@@ est@@ an , a trans@@ ine that tasted in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , he made a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it all over the internet , with my telephone number and a picture of me . he sent them to his t@@ sch@@ et@@ hen@@ ian friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no men more in Ch@@ echn@@ ya that can remove these shame ? &quot;
after that , the photos made by my documents from the whole W@@ hat@@ s@@ App took the round .
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when I was straight , a few shopping pieces from the back@@ seat of my car , I heard one of men &apos;s voice : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when I turned out , I felt anything in my body , but I did nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time on t@@ wit@@ ch@@ astic : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long do you still want to honor the family , you sc@@ and@@ fle@@ ck ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I just know that it was a young man , no 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and woke up in the hospital again .
apparently , some women had got everything and started scre@@ am .
the man was fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two stit@@ ches in my right lung p@@ oul@@ try .
OC Media : in which nurse you were placed - in which men or women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are outdated , there is still my male name dr@@ on ; but the doctor stood and put me to the women .
I am very grateful for this .
when I read his name for the first time in his office , I got it with the fear ; it was a Muslim , a cas@@ eless name .
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him that he respectful with me .
I spent more than one month in the hospital .
in the last February I got threats .
they called me , wrote me - relatives , stran@@ gers , some completely unknown .
this was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was attended by neighbours and some distant relatives .
the demanded to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that everything was a lie .
they asked absurd demands : some said to me , I must prove it by going up without through the roads ; others wanted that I had not changed on the official television in Gros@@ ny , and say that I was not subject to my gender , that everything was only bad speech , and Photoshop .
I have gra@@ ins size C - what would I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it is still hard for them .
some older people once talked to my mother on the street .
they said to her , &quot; They have brought a mon@@ ster to the world that not only your family , but the whole republic is ashamed .
we can not stir you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot;
my mother became too much and she put a strike around the neck .
luckily the neighbors came and saved them .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved into an apartment and a few hours later , under the window was a car with dark@@ ened windows and a number plate with a 95 dr@@ on .
once it happened for the third time , I became clear that there was a little lazy .
my human right friend audi@@ ted the numbers plates - it turned out that I was per@@ sec@@ uted .
OC Media : how did you fly ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons , I do not want to give up their names , but I will say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with her help I left the country , but then something is believed .
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before leaving from Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
I bought them without register without notice , without notice , without everything .
I broke my old SIM card and cast it into the trash .
came and checked to the hotel .
the number was registered on a stran@@ ger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
in the moment when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t think about , you will be in security , just because you have left the country ?
our people already know in which hotel you do . they even know your room number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; just to prove &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; s to prove to you : it is the number 115 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can you imagine ? !
this was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
however , we do not talk about gender equality . however , this is a t@@ abo@@ o topic .
some traditionally cas@@ au@@ tic elements I still tra@@ ded in me .
so much I also wish , this emotional barrier can I not overcome .
I always say that , as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt them .
when we chat with camera , I will give me trouble as to watch the person out of their past - so in my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends , those who have stayed dor@@ ms ?
Sab@@ rina : I have submitted a report to Washington last week .
for whom I needed current information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I spoke to someone who has sent one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he told that during the Ram@@ adan were no people arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he didn &apos;t manage a new wave .
most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives .
so I mean , they probably invite the relatives , these are concerned about the problem with the affected person and in the end require a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; through blood satisfaction has experienced .
OC Media : are now still gay men in these secrecy ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says , there were not very many .
if , then especially those who have no rich relatives , or who were dropped from their relatives to place Kad@@ y@@ rows court .
as far as I know , they are held there so that one can present them later as terrorists .
say : should they be inver@@ ted , they will show their bodies on TV and claim that they could have attacked any village or a military base .
do you understand ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as if these people were not simply van@@ ished , but specifically sub@@ merged to radi@@ alize itself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : is that now only a mut@@ ation or do you have a source of this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was det@@ ained one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard has grown .
there have been nothing new since then .
they have it easy to join .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was self @-@ evident than these people were taken away .
until now they were not presented as a ban@@ dits , there were so far no reports . we suppose that such actions are quite possible .
why else could it not allow this man to shave ?
do you know if these per@@ secu@@ tions and kidn@@ apping of people who listen to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation , have already been held in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always carried my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya , I had a Bob .
I think before 2003 I was already familiar with a great number , when I lived there - and I never had any problems .
in the Ernst !
even from 1998 to 1999 when the Sh@@ aria was considered , I never had any problems .
on the contrary , it was much safer than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia was originally to introduce ourselves to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civil isation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but ultimately , we finally dis@@ car@@ ded back to the stone @-@ time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my eyeb@@ rows were tra@@ ded ; I had dy@@ ed eyelashes , carried the tube and short t@@ ops .
the security of the sh@@ aria has never absorbed me only a hair .
in front of the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people met as I met .
it was a small place where several benches were standing , and all the city knew about them ; they knew why men , young people , there met .
we have never been off@@ ended .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a phrase : Khar@@ da ma Khar@@ da . that is : &quot; Sp@@ otto is not about the un@@ happiness of another . &quot;
it is often said to children , when they are talking about sick .
OC Media : so they just have their eyes closed before you because they believed you are sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they have never co@@ ded me , never hun@@ ted and never be@@ aten .
OC Media : how long stopped this time of grace ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ row stood on the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister for Prime Minister he began to speak on TV about morality .
he did not speak about us per se , but primarily on the behavior of women .
nevertheless - you could feel how the people caught in the city to change .
who previously sm@@ iles and yellow , considered that at one time with suspici@@ on .
in time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I got back home I could feel how the situation in the Republic has steadily deteri@@ or@@ ated .
OC Media : what activity do you proceed now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I do not receive a lot - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the US is not much .
apart from that , I am still working as a activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of Psych@@ ologist .
we organize teac@@ ups , group@@ ings , I beg@@ ining them to hospital and helping them to get f@@ ences .
I have no c@@ ents for this .
I discovered these people myself when I stum@@ bled away .
I am Muslim and would like to help those who need help .
OC Media : enter an Hid@@ den@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : this is amazing .
so nature , that has purely nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Tsch@@ et@@ sch@@ enen , who want to white you with foam in front of the mouth that there are no co@@ ils with them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the D@@ ag@@ est@@ an have those who have the Kab@@ ard@@ ines which , the Russians also have them : but on the whole planet there are - but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am from there , that is why it is unpleasant for me to hear so what to hear .
I meet here as many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go into the mosque and fa@@ sten during the Ram@@ adan - live with men .
do you know how many think in transi@@ tioning to men who love men , and they believe that you will change his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that is a tru@@ ce .
these are two different things - two different types of sensation in order to be exactly , different life settings .
for me it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin and do not be ashamed of my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
sorry to be here personally , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I am not sad at all . I just know that I am now myself .
local groups warn of an increase of self @-@ mor@@ den within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suff@@ ers from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the last months there has been a strong increase in self @-@ murder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ trial of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August backward the du@@ bi@@ ased situation of the Arabic Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Community in Iran , which is marked by poverty and unemployment , into the spot@@ light .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the South@@ west of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he embarrass@@ ed up for his own help , to arise the in@@ ability for his family , so Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i @-@ human rights groups , who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous .
a on YouTube shared video held the moments after having committed himself .
some people managed to clear the flames again , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought into the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the inc@@ iner@@ ations were so strong that doctors could do nothing more .
he died short time later .
it was not the only su@@ icide that has occurred in August within the Arabic Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i minority , and activists on the spot warn that even more men could take life .
the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Centre for Human Rights announces that this month some other - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ w Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - erh@@ aus .
their stories have one thing in common : there were all family members who were helpl@@ ess and in@@ capable due to persecution on the Iranian government , to feed their families and to pursue a safe work .
Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region where most of the Arabic Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community living in Iran has been sha@@ ken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult for the native Arab population to ride their livel@@ i@@ hoods .
in a century ago , the Arabic Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ahl@@ avi Mon@@ archy took over power and under@@ took the 1925 large efforts to end the ethnic autonomy in Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the biggest in Iran in the coming oil and gas fields as well as some of the most significant and valuable health areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to grow slow , and the native population gets only little of this wealth .
it is often victims of un@@ treated diseases , hunger and hard@@ ships .
Iranian regime denied the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Arabs systematically jobs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry .
the government has also built a variety of hol@@ dings , the water from the Arab areas into the Persian territories where the provinces is Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m .
these rams have only led to wor@@ sen the devast@@ ation caused by dr@@ y@@ ness caused by dr@@ y@@ ness , and local farming as well as the fish and palm industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ ha@@ w@@ zi youths rose now to 81 % .
N@@ our Moh@@ ammed P@@ ur , the Iranian Director for Ko@@ operative , Work and Social Wel@@ fare , noted that 5 % of Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is who are looking for a job , completed 55 % a secondary school and 45 % have completed a university degree .
a &quot; systematic strategy ... that aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ himi , an Iranian Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i human rights activ@@ ist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; led to a &quot; high increase in the number of self @-@ mor@@ den among young Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i @-@ men .
Do@@ himi said that especially the unemployment has recently become worse . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ancestors in Ah@@ wa@@ z new ethnic and anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the creation process :
since function@@ aries and institutions do not prefer Arab labour power , the local Arabian Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i is removed from access to work possibilities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance to young Arabs and to force them to earn their livel@@ i@@ hood outside their homeland .
there are people who had to change their predec@@ essors and sur@@ name to hide their belonging to the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i to hide and be put on , as even the Arab name will not be tolerated , because the speaking of the Arabic language or the wearing Arabian clothing .
given the given circumstances , which have to endure the Arabic Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i , hit human rights defen@@ ders , before the situation is explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world watches and takes knowledge of it .
the main reason for su@@ icide is un@@ treated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and su@@ icide is avoidable .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why I do not identify with the femin@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; even with the inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ als &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is a revised version of the opinion published by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ Ã©@@ min@@ as website . the article was subject of several discussions where many different positions came to be expressed .
you can read in the comments under the original text .
when I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , many women react - especially white women who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - with frustration .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put well thought scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be femin@@ ist and why we generally should be all femin@@ ist * inside .
for example , women still earn less money despite equal education than men .
that women are still under strict observation , when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their body .
that violence against women is a global epidemic .
or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women come sooner or later in various fields of life to a glass blan@@ ket , and that discrimination based on sex still moves across the many different countries and beliefs .
all of this is aware and known to me .
I am convinced and I am double and triple among them .
I am a black woman .
and yet , when I speak on skin colour , on racism , on black CIS women , on black women in the LGB@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the Dias@@ pora ; when I mention , on which way we have always been physically , psychological and verbal movement , many white fem@@ inists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists are to be silent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , everyone agree that women - all women - should come together to lift &quot; their voices and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ umb@@ aya &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; my Lord &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to achieve equality ( some ) of women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but they don &apos;t want to talk about that it is in addition to sexu@@ alised violence a institution@@ alised form of rac@@ ist violence that we are exposed black women in two fold ways .
or that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and countries of origin earn less than white men and women .
that black girl and girls are refer@@ enced with a migration background of school than white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
or that women in black spheres and women are exposed to a higher risk to suffer domestic violence and violence in partnership , as white women .
on the one hand , I will say that all men , all men and all of all humans have the same rights ; on the other hand , I can not join me as a black woman , in whose centre the white woman stands , which refuse to take into account in@@ jus@@ tices in their mind , which refer to both the gender and the skin colour of a person .
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ femin@@ ist ple@@ dge that has always rejected me and countless other black women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; So@@ ek@@ ner def@@ endant 18@@ 51 in her speech : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I refuse to maintain a ideology , in which the black woman in historical ways is a de@@ human@@ ised and margin@@ alized nature . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I refuse to join me group@@ ings , which also absor@@ bing our customs and customs to drive their ego@@ cent@@ ric programme .
I will no longer try to put white women the importance of tri@@ mmer of skin colour and gender . for some of them will continue to mention the importance of black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to honor them one better .
although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different arri@@ vals and boundaries themselves from the white femin@@ ism , is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in his name .
I prefer to get rid of myself completely and completely by the femin@@ ism and called me the movement of the W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman , rather in@@ sist@@ ent that inter@@ se@@ duction is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever before we define black women in our own ideas and embar@@ ked us into the spheres , which are created by us for us .
Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ cana is : Rec@@ la@@ im@@ ing , ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : how we can defend ourselves in this way , in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , mental , physical , and even the spiritual elements can be re@@ vered that make the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion after they read these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of femin@@ ist movement , by which the black woman is concerned .
in a bl@@ ur@@ istic environment , I can lift black women and women of other cultures , because in this paradigm I exist .
I will be recognized as part of this paradigm due to my dark skin and because of my existence .
I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment in which my life is neither passed nor ignored , nor rejected .
pad@@ lock against pollution : the mission of a man to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations
this contribution from To@@ dd Re@@ ub@@ old was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports in@@ particular about international efforts to solve environmental problems .
in the context of a content sharing agreement , this article is published here again .
over again , Nab@@ il Mus@@ a travelled over the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or can@@ oe - with a special concern through the Kur@@ dist@@ an region in Iraq . his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentary by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains us his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river that we had lost as I was a child , &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , construction of lam@@ bs , pollution and un@@ controlled development , will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organisation Water@@ ke@@ e@@ pers - an subsidiary of Water@@ ke@@ eper Alliance - to protect the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video Mus@@ a summar@@ izes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we no longer have water , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was produced for En@@ sia by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , one in Er@@ bil , in Iraq , and multi@@ medi@@ al journalism , filmed , filmed and published .
the emphasis of her work lies on trac@@ ed , little be@@ aten sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of co@@ oper@@ atively video photography and new multi @-@ media techniques , with their help oppressed communities , their stories to tell their way .
Paraguay &apos;s women and their harder fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women poses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crying women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to express their pain on the women &apos;s mor@@ nings in the country and in the region and show their rejection . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the shortened and processed version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; of course . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # devi@@ ate ) which reports on the spices of women in Paraguay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most names have been changed to protect the people concerned . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a police com@@ ab@@ used said A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez that they had nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , their exile , who has grown to be violent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the end of their relationship , a little time has passed and the police said , their statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as another woman Bal@@ bu@@ ena showed , because mis@@ chi@@ ev@@ ous also showed the acute display of A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez nothing .
a few days later , the second lady pulled back their ad .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
when women report at all , they generally receive no support from the state .
in many cases women are also financially dependent on men they mis@@ chi@@ ev@@ ous . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence at all in case of prosecution authorities .

it is difficult to determine how many women are really mis@@ diagnosed , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez , researcher at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aciÃ³n y E@@ studios , a social @-@ scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various statements and reports that will not even raise the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
the available figures are however alar@@ ming .
in 2015 , at the District State Bar 9@@ 600 ads went on account of domestic violence . at 70 % of it , it was about violence against women .
86 % of the ads in the police came from women .
there were more than 5000 ads due to domestic violence in the peace process . also here 86 % of the ads came from women .
in the ads , 40 % of women said they were physically mis@@ diagnosed , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse .
these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen Frauen@@ mini@@ ster@@ in Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only a few of these crimes are actually displayed . &quot; on any woman who are not reimbur@@ sed in Paraguay because of psych@@ ic mis@@ conception , 9 women who do not do this .
on any woman who are reimbur@@ sed because of physical distr@@ acts , two women , who do not do this , &quot; stated them at the end of 2014 .
since women &apos;s murder in Paraguay have no own criminal law , the prosecution authorities can not be adequately documented how many women were mur@@ dered by their current or former partners every year .
until August 2016 , journalists were at least 12 cases of femin@@ ism in the country .
the coordin@@ ator for human rights in Paraguay is at least 37 cases where women were mur@@ dered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , in Paraguay every ten days dies a woman due to violence by men .

invisible Mis@@ sions and a legal system that does not under@@ takes anything
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ Ã­@@ te@@ z the firm friend of Carlos Vera was insi@@ sted that she called his name to him all of her former friends .
in the beginning they didn &apos;t want this , but then after . this should rep@@ ent them forever .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos together . but two years she bore the mental violence against women - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time recognizing the most severely recognizable :
I never thought that I would become victims of abuse .
if I read about it earlier , I always thought that that only women &apos;s happening to dis@@ miss the ones because they let themselves be dec@@ eived by violent men .
I was convinced that I would never happen .
Mari@@ ana uses social media to report about the mis@@ ra@@ ging through Carlos Vera .
without name , she wrote posts on Facebook , where they described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during their two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated them .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rh@@ et@@ or@@ ically , whether he ever raised the hand against them , and refused to confess that his behaviour was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why they had fallen for such a long time by Carlos and did not leave him earlier .
it seemed almost as they wanted to say that victims of mis@@ conduct would have at least a certain complic@@ ity to it .
Victoria San@@ tos that does not come from Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner was mis@@ chi@@ pped .
Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te C@@ RE@@ O ( &quot; I think &quot; ) that consists of women , which are all victims of mis@@ conduct .
in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as case everything started with psych@@ ic mixing .
their aff@@ lu@@ ent partner eventually managed to persu@@ ade them that it was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat her .
Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as displays at the authorities without a result and also from its relatives , she received no support .
it led a process against her former partner who developed into an un@@ spo@@ si@@ able legal struggle between Paraguay and their home country , in which it was mainly about money , power and influence of their former partner .
Paraguay &apos;s laws : good approach , def@@ ective implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good , but are not applied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ad of abuse is a way of resistance and a fight against corruption in justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen E@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN Organisation for Women in Paraguay , looks also major problems when applying the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a bill was discussed under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ el@@ as ( # Prin@@ ted ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # non @-@ One ) are part of a campaign on Twitter which is supported by Am@@ nest@@ y International .
the original draft of the law considers that Fem@@ izi@@ d was to explain and de@@ fi@@ erc@@ ed to an independent criminal law , as it is already in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia .
so the Legisl@@ ative text was changed in some points to also win the MPs for the law so that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions will be banned , which is currently prohibited in Paraguay and can be pun@@ ished with up to five years imprisonment .
the original bill introduced , most of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs that have to bear the victims of violence currently , if they just want to report and receive a safe accommodation to set up the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri argued that the law is not effective if the legis@@ lat@@ ure does not provide sufficient financial resources for it :
in Paraguay is distr@@ acted as part of human relationships .
here , a re@@ thinking must take place so that violence is no longer considered a little Nor@@ mal .
whoever tac@@ kl@@ ates this facts make himself guilty and contributes to the fact that the perpetrators will get stra@@ igh@@ tened out .
we have to refund such a long ad until distr@@ action is no longer considered normal .
on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen Senate . previously , parts of the law had been changed . yet , among other things , a passage was painted , which called the partners in cases of domestic violence for reconciliation .
the opinions on the changes go apart .
the section concerning reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for ag@@ gres@@ sor , to attack its victims again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the submission of words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sex , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; political force &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of parts of the law , however , applies as a great back@@ stroke . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this article is the shortened and processed version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; of course . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # devi@@ ate ) which reports on the spices of women in Paraguay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most names have been changed to protect the people concerned . &quot; &quot; &quot;
independent media in O@@ man continued to print out a year after the prohibition of a newspaper
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was closed due to a resolution of the information minister &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the homepage of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Forbidden Zeitung Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than one year ago the om@@ anic authorities have joined the independent arab@@ ic @-@ speaking newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of their reporting about corruption in the Sult@@ an .
You@@ t Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in prison , where he cons@@ ulted an old prison sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were also arrested and put in court , but later came back again .
O@@ man has been ruled by Sult@@ an Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid , who came to power after he had his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , through a state of affairs .
since then , in addition to his role as the only Sult@@ an , the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Defence Minister , Supreme Minister , Minister , Foreign Minister , President of the Supreme Council for the planning and President of the Central Bank .
the rule of the Sult@@ an is characterized by the per@@ sever@@ ing efforts of security forces , in particular of domestic secrecy , public freedoms , including press freedom , restrict and human rights defen@@ ders , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists , intim@@ id@@ ate and det@@ ained .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities limit peaceful and legitimate activities in human rights systematically and hin@@ ders citizens , also activists to express their views on public affairs , such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the attack on the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper , its closure and detention three of their editors last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper in which since its inc@@ eption in 2007 about corruption in O@@ man ( an absolute monarchy ) was reported until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , chief of Az@@ am@@ n , published in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 and was published an article entitled &quot; high @-@ ranking parties &quot; hands of the judiciary . in this , it was about corruption in the judiciary and the interference of high @-@ level officials in judicial decisions .
in the report , government officials accused , judge of the Supreme Court of O@@ man to put pressure on pressure , to lift up a judgment in a possession of inheritance .

on 3 August 2016 , V@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , a member of the Board of Directors , loaded from the ISS before the Special Department and was arrested on his arrival by the security forces .
on 9 August 2016 the ISS adopted the Deputy @-@ editor of You@@ th@@ j Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who acts to Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is arrest as the editor @-@ editor .
the paper was closed at irregular time after the Information Minister gave the statement that &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper on any way , including online , from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the first negotiations took place in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i .
the Court condemned the three journalists to prison and ord@@ ained the final closure of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were arrested both among other things because of the disorder of the public order , &quot; misuse of the internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining the state of the state . &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was also found guilty of violation of an audience and s@@ lan@@ der for guilty .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years imprisonment and money stra@@ ws at the amount of 3000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . in addition , a one @-@ year professional ban was imposed on the two journalists .
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to a year in prison and an money in the amount of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 2600 US dollar ) , after having the use of &quot; a information network for the dissemination of material that could pose a danger to public order . &quot;
for Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , a deposit was fixed at the amount of 5000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( 13 000 US dollars ) and was released on 22 August 2016 prior to the judgment .
the Appe@@ al Court said Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 freely , sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari to six months of prison .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 according to the rep@@ ell@@ ation of his six @-@ month prison sentence from the central l@@ atex in mas@@ kat . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison , where he cons@@ ulted his old prison sentence .
the Appe@@ als Chamber also highlighted the decision of the Information Ministry of Information , the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; to close .
despite the decision of the Court , Az@@ am@@ n again , the newspaper looks still exposed to attacks by the Iranian government .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information ministers allowed a statement , which was extended by the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information Minister personally signed an additional statement , in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , and thus the Ministers agreed again against the decision of the Appe@@ al Court , the publication of the newspaper again .
the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspapers are not the only cases in which the press freedom has been violated in recent times .
for other injuries , e.g. closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ ine and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to set its operation .
due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of the journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ anic authorities are still not ready to end the extensive violation of the press freedom .
the Golf @-@ Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the om@@ anic authorities on :
1 . You@@ t Al @-@ Ha@@ j release immediately and un@@ condi@@ tionally ;
2 . create a safe environment for the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper so that their journalists can go on their work .
3 . to protect press freedom in the country and
4 . in all circumstances to ensure that human rights defen@@ ders and journalists in O@@ man hin@@ ders their ri@@ ghtful human rights work , and without fear of understanding , including judicial systems , can exercise .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ ors 2016 in Zambia , figure takes place with his consent
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media or at all . it is a growing area that addresses the most urgent needs of the continent .
for the need on site medical research there are two reasons : for a lack of global health system many medicines and vaccines that cover the special medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis and malaria in the poorest countries of Africa have far more grave effects than elsewhere , and lack of investment for the exploration of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies are a big problem .
second , research , which is conducted by African scientists by establishing own research capacity in Africa . a major role in science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ ors is director of the Central Bank at the Centre for the research of infectious diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR@@ Z ) .
he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epidemic , first gra@@ zing impact on national health .
he left Sam@@ bia for a study in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indiana .
when a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania resear@@ ches himself on HIV virus before he decided to go home to support the sam@@ ic health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. Warri@@ ors discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about the mis@@ understanding of the media about this research .
( Disclaimer : Dr. H. he speaks as an individual ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ ors R@@ W : in the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ bian national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I just got a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens .
G@@ V : what do you think is the most important scientific themes in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
r@@ w : there are no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed differently .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must change , otherwise we will always remain the recipient instead of ourselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the solutions we get are often not suitable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
G@@ V : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
R@@ W : from the US and Europe .
the projects are very well supported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or go here , because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ V : how is the research infrastructure ?
which obstacles are there in your routine research work which you did not have before ?
r@@ w : the basic infrastructure does not correspond to the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money , a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries .
G@@ V : how is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
r@@ w : there are already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
G@@ V : how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , where should they focus and how can we support the development ?
r@@ w : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is need for special scientific training , starting at any age .
the social sciences , computer sciences , big data , research of space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and con@@ ta@@ gi@@ ous diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it .
G@@ V : can you describe us the pros and cons of Life as a scientist in Africa against Western countries based on your experience ?
r@@ w : often there are the limited speed , things to do , and the more difficult access to scientific expertise , which represent challenges here .
the system that magazines are only made available for payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , limited the amount of availability information and speed of research .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the USA to India : how &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeds manufacturers change worldwide food production
this entry by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the En@@ si@@ a.com webpage , a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mor@@ ton have been bre@@ d in the USA since the 1980s .
his company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ dish , the first plant cultivated by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in Space and consumed .
almost 20 years Mor@@ ton &apos;s work was done only by his own objection and the question how many sal@@ at@@ eries he can get , limits .
but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he re@@ marked that more and more sal@@ ads were patented and that he could not use them for breeding .
the patents are not only used for individual varieties , but also for specific properties such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green or green leaves .
in recent years , more and more of these patents have been filed in more and more plants like grain or cardboard boxes . due to these trends , plant breeders , environmental protection and atomic facts ensure food security for the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia old tradition , Mor@@ ton still smells , he needs to be longer since his work is becoming more and more difficult due to limitations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is , as would lie in a river a rock &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rock &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to p@@ add@@ ling &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have to do that now , but it is a break with the breeding @-@ tradition &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think these patents go to Sal@@ ads . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if they stand before judgment , no one can breed more of a new sal@@ ads , because all the characteristics are already patented . &quot; he thus makes as good as possible and tried to breed those features that he wants .
however , however , it is very careful and stri@@ ves to use no material that is protected as intellectual property .
he also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the US and everywhere in the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International spac@@ ecraft ISS red Roman sal@@ ads in the &quot; gre@@ enh@@ ouses &quot; of the station bre@@ d and eaten , there will be tested whether plants are cultivated in space .

it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like it would come from the IT area and not from the plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; open @-@ Source &quot; seed ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; open Source &quot; software that provides alternatives to copyrighted software .
it was called into being in order to ensure that some plant species and gene are not protected as intellectual property and permanently available for plant breeders .
within the framework of the initiative , just Os@@ si , the U.S. bre@@ eder can commit to us that others can use seeds from them freely .
this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and they can sell their seeds . &quot; open source &quot; breeders only permit others who breed their seeds , to breed it in order to breed so own varieties , and it is not immediately ab@@ ees - two aspects which are banned or prescribed by many plant @-@ plants .
do@@ zens of do@@ zens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its start in 2014 .
glo@@ omy prospects
for the em@@ eri@@ ous professor of the University of Wis@@ cons@@ in @-@ Ma@@ dison and Os@@ si @-@ Vor@@ members Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control of the seed and the opportunity to breed new plants , both important for food security and environmental protection .
seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try to use the latter or only little to exploit seeds with natural res@@ ili@@ ence .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stresses that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement does not work with gene@@ tically modified plants .
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , gene@@ tically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; who wants to buy good , locally and sustainable producing vegetables , as it is offered at farm markets , should also know that the way it is bre@@ d on how this vegetables is bre@@ d .
&quot; &quot; &quot; food addi@@ ctions without seed is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative commit to others their seed continues to be free of charge . thus , their action in contrast is to patent seed and plant characteristics .
photo of Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
Os@@ si supporters argue that the future of food supplies is je@@ op@@ ardis@@ ed because the available pool is due to the increasingly diverse intellectual property rights on plant material , which thus has always been reduced , un@@ condi@@ tionally shr@@ inking .
Claire Lu@@ by , Executive director of the Os@@ si , has engaged in their doctoral thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . it found out that about a third of all cart@@ ography characteristics is protected as intellectual property , thus it is suitable for plant breeders either at all or only available .
for other plants there are such estimates not yet , but experts such as Lu@@ by suppose that mass@@ aging plants such as wheat in even bigger style are patented than salad or car@@ rots .
a question of view
plants will be so bre@@ d that they have targeted features - from those in which their taste or colour improves up to such , due to which they prosp@@ er in certain environments and threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties point out that the available plant material for bre@@ eder caused by more and more patents . genetic diversity is currently constra@@ ined than ever since the changed conditions are much worse due to climate change much worse .
in an e @-@ mail Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ Spe@@ cher@@ in Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to that genetic diversity is generally important and also decisive for mon@@ e@@ tos activities . with a total of four banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Economic Affairs of the United States , the company is committed to maintaining the genetic diversity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it contradi@@ cts that intellectual property supports other breeders , because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patents and the protection of plant vari@@ et@@ fed innovations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a patent is basically taken a plan that everyone can follow once the patent has exp@@ ired . &quot; &quot; &quot;
often these instructions help others with another method to get to the same result .
such protection does not in@@ hibit innovations , but promotes them by providing more material and know @-@ how to the public . &quot;
Mor@@ ton sees the other : 20 years to wait for a patent reading , is certainly not innovations .
and if you need to wait for a long time , to breed plants that have been adapted to the changed environmental conditions , one would have lost the battle already .
but the main argument for Mor@@ ton is that genetic resources have always been a general public and continue to remain : &quot; independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ et@@ aires are not attractive to us .
we want farmers to make their work easier .
this is what drives us , and it will make us impossible if we cannot continue to use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot;
overall , Mor@@ ton is bother@@ ing to patent on the concept of itself , plant features : &quot; we do not create the characteristics really itself .
they make up the plants themselves and as bre@@ eder we finally had no idea how the plants do that .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for Carol Dep@@ pe , plant bre@@ eder in the U.S. state Oregon and Os@@ si , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; who bre@@ d a variety , also bre@@ d its own values in it .
those who believes in industrial agriculture with large cour@@ ty@@ ards and mon@@ oc@@ ultur@@ es , for whose cultivation it needs her@@ b@@ icide , bre@@ d in its varieties of this concept of agriculture .
my concept is accurate . &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such , which are on international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to are patents , they create most smaller seed companies , even without patents - either they reject this patent or they do it for too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case .
the independent plant @-@ maker Frank Mor@@ ton is searching in his breeding garden sal@@ ads .

Mor@@ ton is also the view that bre@@ eder caused by the prevention of plant patents : &quot; it looks like I am with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that patented .
I need constantly new material for my catalogue , as I know that my competitors know my varieties in a couple of years , &quot; says he . &quot; with a patent is being protected for 20 years before competition , so that in my opinion it is pretty easy to make . &quot; worldwide resonance
while the US seems to be a leading position in the &quot; open source &quot; breeding , the concept is now spreading rapidly across the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , a &quot; open @-@ source &quot; seed program works in the centre of farmers and helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain requirements .
it also supports them to come to &quot; open source &quot; seeds and sell their own .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German organization Agreement Sign@@ s an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open @-@ source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; license , which ultimately is a form@@ ative and legally binding form of the Os@@ si commitment to bre@@ eder in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( regulations for breeding differ from country to country , present not just one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive committee of the European Union , the European Commission , explains that un@@ conventional plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . thus , it speaks against the current practice of the European patent , the patents applied to conventional plants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , an explanation is not yet a law ; now it is at the governments of the Member States to put the patent for this new line . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os hosted a conference on &quot; open source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , on the farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from across East Africa to learn something about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards pat@@ enting seeds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; program for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seed systems &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; that the organization currently establishes a worldwide alliance for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seed systems for the planned next year of the official start@@ up drop . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a consortium of environmental protection and development groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non@@ profit @-@ development organization US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has put together a database for seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .

human rights organisation and blog are the latest destinations of cens@@ or@@ ship in Egypt
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still the Egyptian authorities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; content on the Internet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ ni@@ sts .
on the weekend around the 05.@@ August , the Egyptian government continued the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ H@@ RI ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported above sel@@ fers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; August , the network published an opinion on Facebook , in which it sharp@@ ly critici@@ zed the Egyptian authorities for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information Appe@@ al - despite this attack and the mo@@ ck@@ ling of Egyptian law and the constitution to defend oneself in this part of the world , it was never as important as now . AN@@ H@@ RI acknow@@ le@@ dges that all technical possibilities have been exhausted to overcome the block@@ age and not to im@@ itate . we insist on our task to fulfill our task .
AN@@ H@@ RI is considered to be the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organization in Egypt , after the authorities blocked more than two months 21 web pages , as e.g. the independent news page MA@@ DA Mas@@ r , Arabic @-@ speaking edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , and that out of Qatar stam@@ mer@@ ing network of Al J@@ aze@@ era because of the more con@@ genital support of terrorism . &quot;

in addition to AN@@ H@@ RI in addition to AN@@ H@@ RI &apos;s blog , Ah@@ med Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no access to Egypt .
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the spread of colum@@ ni@@ sts and articles which he does not write in Egypt with public websites and media .
now the blog , which he was directed to handle the cens@@ er apparatus of the Egyptian government , even the aim of an attack .
Blo@@ gger , the provider of which also is heated in the blog is also accessible , on the other hand , it is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photographer , spent nearly 500 days in captivity , after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces during December 2013 , while he reported about the Stud@@ enten@@ werk and a video , how the police exercise physical violence against two students .
his article revol@@ ve mainly about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada expressed by the government and reflected what this means for him :
the blogs to lock is very old , however , has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fatal tah al @-@ S@@ isi . and even if the block@@ age of blogs may not be significant for the world , it is however it for two reasons for me :
1 ) It has succeeded to im@@ part me the feeling of an ins@@ ulating state ; an arrest , a attempted murder , anticip@@ ation of the National Security Council , blocking blogs as well as any other website for which I worked .
2 ) You have proven that I was not in vain . in other words , my words have an influence , even if only on a small audience .
I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it to post items to handle the cens@@ or@@ ship .
but now , after they have blocked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the mu@@ gs go the way up to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Ex@@ pression ( AF@@ TE ) of Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06 . August 133 websites . this took place technical tests in the networks of different Internet Service Provider ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ d@@ af@@ one and E@@ tis@@ al@@ at .
AF@@ TE also documented the block@@ age from suppliers , through the transformation of boarding facilities and private surfing , so called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
AF@@ TE reported in its research :
on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the block@@ age of websites that V@@ P@@ N@@ s offer .
such a practice indicates the intention of blocking the government to block and filter content to the Egyptian users .
the situation will additionally be wor@@ mm@@ ed that the C@@ ens@@ ory decisions are taken behind closed doors , thus the Egyptian population has no legal basis , which they can proceed in court against these actions .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with cens@@ or@@ ship and whom will they attack next attack ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants argue .

day by day newspapers in whole Brazil with glo@@ omy head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of many post@@ cards mo@@ tive .
some of these lines are as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old in school , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every second day , a police officers in Rio de Janeiro mur@@ dered &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Di@@ ebe ro@@ b pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President T@@ emer sent 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , Marine and Lu@@ ftw@@ af@@ ee to Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation the spices of 2017 reached the highest stand for 10 years .
the Brazilian governmental organisation Global Justice , the United Nations , called for even the United Nations to interven@@ e .
reports like these are all @-@ daily and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least the manager of a local paper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the detailed reporting of violence in Rio known newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 16 August the editorial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is not normal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which it announced , a new section called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published there .
the motives for their decision explained the newspaper so :
extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in any big city in the world like murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sex inter@@ rupt , etc . all , which happens from civili@@ zed standard and what happens only in Rio , will be in the section &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not include our eyes before the cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four @-@ minute video that was shared on Facebook , Oct@@ Ã¡@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the editor of the newspaper , that this decision is not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure .
extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war of war in a country that does not recognise the war at all .
in the same video , a journalist of the newspaper explained that there are according to indications of the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 8@@ 43 areas which are controlled by criminal organisations .
in the editorial department the newspaper writes :
us is aware that a war discourse when it is distor@@ ted , even if it can be used , atro@@ cities of the police , who only sho@@ ots and then ask questions to tu@@ cked .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose aim is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and its partners .
is the name &quot; War &quot; more than it protects ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Brasi@@ l ar@@ gues the journalist Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira against it to call violence as &quot; war . &quot; this is their opinion a justification of the failed security policy through the media and could make it difficult to account for the police account .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and bad planning - as extra in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel , education , and a historical and self @-@ counterf@@ eit@@ ing of public service .
to remember : the Rio de Janeiro state is greater than just its capital .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Rio de Janeiro , called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most violent place in Brazil &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; according to Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia is false : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 22 of the 30 violent cities in Brazil , according to statistics of 2015 in the north and north @-@ east of the country . these are the most up @-@ to @-@ date data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these cities is located in the Rio de Janeiro state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we look at the M@@ ord@@ rates per federal state , Rio is on position 16 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes them . &quot; &quot; &quot;

these measures also belonged to the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ Ã­@@ cia Paci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the federal state of Rio in 2003 , whose aim is to conquer a F@@ av@@ ela , and permanently in@@ feed a unit permanently there .
in the beginning this actually led to a withdrawal of violent deaths . for a few years the U@@ PP has led the U@@ PP after several reports on sli@@ ps and re@@ pres@@ sions against the poor communities who were supposed to protect the newly created police unit , increasingly under accus@@ ation .
on his Facebook @-@ page , the journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux from one of his articles from 2010 , in which he explains why violence in Rio did not identify - by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as war also draws serious consequences for people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for this calls the state to use means and ways that are typical of war . this belongs to the territory of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enemy &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which a civil war is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and an object for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lost balls &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the following civil war , many Syrian cities are suffering from brutal si@@ ege and block@@ ages , mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops .
according to victories Watch , a joint initiative of the peace organization Pa@@ x and the Forschungs@@ institut The Syria Institute , are located in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , D@@ ei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ lib currently around a million Syri@@ ans in a state of si@@ ege .
especially strongly affected is the region East Gh@@ out@@ a , where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 , the lives of hundreds of civilians called for .
many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition go out , based on studies of the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the mass@@ acre of Assad regime has been practi@@ sed .
since 2013 , these have been controlled by rebels outside of Damascus under si@@ ege which led residents to rely on local or through tunnels and control points .
due to the long block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat has become un@@ at@@ tainable for large parts of the population .
in return , a group of Syrian humanitarian aid and ac@@ adem@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , as they can plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ ni@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms do not belong to the conventional ones , in Syria and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine . however , they do not make an attractive nutritional source for many inhabitants of the besi@@ eged East Gh@@ out@@ a .
the direc@@ ting of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we chose the cultivation of mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and bas@@ ements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr. Ah@@ med L@@ eil@@ a , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices , that already fought for three years to announce this project and pressing its relief that it is now gaining more and more &quot; acquaint@@ ance . &quot;
to collect money for the initiative , take advantage in consultation with the NGO G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ as the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do .
it is planned to mediate 125 families of knowledge about plant@@ ing pil@@ es , as Dr. L@@ eil@@ a to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have achieved over 100 % of its expected target of about 12.@@ 700 â¬ , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ Do .
the initiative is dependent on generators , which hold the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80 % .
due to the fuel scar@@ city , locally produced fuel is used from plastic , to supply the generators with the necessary energy .
Dr. L@@ eil@@ a said Global Vo@@ ices , that they began with the &quot; production from the regions of pilgrims &quot; before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption .
then they planted a small mushroom in a tub . as this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; teacher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months they have been distributed in East Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge .
Dr. L@@ eil@@ a explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach the men the fungus @-@ breeding for various reasons : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; break of si@@ ege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
providing a new food source on the market .
spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by eating foods ( like paper , tea , coff@@ es@@ atz , cart@@ on , etc ) are used for the extraction of new foods .
creating new jobs , especially for women working at home .
creating new jobs for people with disabilities that are bound to their homes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to spread this idea throughout the world so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and the si@@ ege is visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experiences inspired by people in crisis areas and we can help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of the fires of 2017
several hundreds of people prot@@ ested on October 21st in many districts in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of fires that are assi@@ fied in the North of Portugal in the north of Portugal .
two and forty people died , and approximately 70 were wounded as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the fact that the government called a state of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
fires were also registered in the region of Galicia in Spain , where there was 4 dead .
it appreci@@ ates that there were more than 500 fire@@ breaks that spread out in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million acres of forest and numerous villages .
in June , Pedr@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o Grande took a similar tragedy , where the fires had 64 deaths and more than 200 wounded .
according to the European for@@ estry system that monitors the forest land by satellite recordings , alone 2017 in Portugal are burned about 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest - an area of the size of the district Lisbon .
so that you can make a better picture of the Ernst &apos;s position : there is only in 4 districts not a fire .
whole Portugal burns in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - N@@ ata ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) 15 October , 2017

the fores@@ ee@@ able tragedy ...
the aim of the protests of Saturday was the demand for better prev@@ ent@@ ative and fire prevention measures .
the people asked why the civil protection was not able to interven@@ e the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
JoÃ£o Sover@@ al of the Federation of farmers from Portugal explained the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
after Pedr@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o , streets and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did not do this nowhere : there are d@@ iner reports of open streets that were enclosed by fire .
in the forest of Lei@@ ria there would have been a similar tragedy like in June , since the streets were locked very late . &quot;
furthermore , construction permits in locations with high Bran@@ dr@@ isi@@ ko will be questioned .
a wide suggestion for the whale @-@ form which had brought the government on the most severe fires in 2003 and 2005 , was rejected by the municipalities which saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government led a Lo@@ ck@@ ening of the law , which was in case of case allowed if the applicant could be built upon means of self @-@ protection - that was an open back@@ door , so that everything could be built &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; JoÃ£o Sor@@ val in the same article of the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us made aware that large areas with Eu@@ cal@@ yp@@ tus , trees made of slightly burning wood , like in a famine , according to fires of this kind .
these problems arise that the website of the civilian protection of Portugal on 15 and 16 October , when inhabitants were looking or tried to contact relatives , offline .
it was a private initiative , which cat@@ ered the population with information : they used their own civilian protection data using the application fo@@ gos@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developers JoÃ£o Pina &apos;s life to simplify work of fire fighting and was held at this f@@ ateful weekend in October so crucial that the server pursued the attack of the 400@@ ,000 users who per@@ secu@@ te the site more than half a million access .

the way from the refugee from Afghanistan to successful entrepreneurs

in a night in the autumn of 1994 the conquest of Afghanistan began through the Taliban .
two years ago , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ ed@@ in group@@ ings which had conquered the short @-@ term pro @-@ Soviet government . thus , Afghanistan has become a country of terror and despair .
right at that time A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central af@@ gh@@ an@@ istan , for the last time with his family at dinner .
even if his mother did not say it at that time , she knew that she would not see her son a very long time - maybe even more .
in dawn the boy should set up .
his un@@ cle would pick him up and bring him to the mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers .

Ab@@ du@@ l Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of Haz@@ ara dom@@ ed party h@@ z@@ b @-@ W@@ ah@@ ah had just been mur@@ dered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt vulnerable .
the Taliban opened for their hatred of Haz@@ ara and ever closer .
many Haz@@ ara prov@@ oked the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
some days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan again .
he worked for a couple of years in a coher@@ ence . the work was heavy and made him sick .
then he took what was left of his low wages , and went to Iran . once again , he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and tow@@ ed sacks with mort@@ ar who were he@@ avier than he himself , in order to earn their livel@@ i@@ hoods .
at that time , life of Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran was characterized by misery and exploitation .
&quot; it was really tough , &quot; reminded A@@ shar@@ af in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( af@@ gh@@ an refugees ) lived in a le@@ ak@@ es@@ standing building on the job@@ site , on which we worked .
there was no services there and no heating . we hung n@@ ylon in front of the open windows so that we do not inv@@ aders at night . &quot;
after four years A@@ shar@@ af left his life without papers in Iran and made ready for the trip to Europe .
during the dangerous crossing on the sea , he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and stran@@ ger on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities rejected its asylum entry , A@@ zz@@ af 2002 came to Italy .
some time had homeless homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church who distributed twice a day of food to needy .
it is true that Italy is due to relatively high loading quot@@ as a kind of second chance for exp@@ ired asylum seekers . it is also true that the conditions that asylum seekers in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic .
the civil rights organization Civil War Union for Europe writes , the system is suffering from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority of the asylum seekers will be accommod@@ ated in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special reception centres &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; this is an impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared staff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Italian law , asylum seekers can only be assigned to an entrance center , if they have officially placed a request for asylum - what can occur after the registration of the asylum application .
until then , people who have no money for accommodation , either reli@@ ant on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the street .
so there is also A@@ shar@@ k .
but his un@@ bound@@ less way of life helped A@@ shar@@ k to release themselves out of these conditions soon .
after having made several years different work in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ k tasted its entire savings in the establishment of a hostel in Venice .
this was so good that after a while he opened a second hostel and a snor@@ kel .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis success story is now subject of the documentation &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the film received the Venice City Award , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Italians - are very difficult .
lots of bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles .
according to in@@ official estimates , approximately 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries .
in recent years some of the Afgh@@ ans company emerged , including tail@@ ors , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
Ham@@ ed Ah@@ m@@ adi had the idea to his restaurant Orient Experience in which the wa@@ iter and the chef had mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu &apos;s menu is told by the various af@@ gh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes the history of their trip to Italy .
the Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Padua the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a S@@ ushi restaurant in Rome are also called Afgh@@ ans .
however , A@@ shar@@ af@@ s objectives reach far beyond the Italian food trade and the retail outlets and aim back to the country which he had to leave a teen@@ ager as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where a risk is , are also possibilities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says A@@ shar@@ k with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I never forget my country and I can not live happily if I know that my people suff@@ ers .
I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country , especially for women .
they represent the half of society and have to get the same possibilities as any other . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ pen@@ ny also for@@ ged plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul where people can learn packaging and consistency techniques . &quot; in this way , they can sell their harvest on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; says he .
the development of successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubts , but in the end there are stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey itself . now he wants to also help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Egyptian parliament checks a draft bill on which users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration at a government agency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
users would have to be able to use social networks , within six months after successful legislative decre@@ e on the website of the authority under specification of their full name and number .
whoever fails to miss this step up to six months of prison or the end of a criminal withdrawal may be condemned .
the law , which was advertis@@ ed by sixty parliamentary members , is currently under legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament , and will be deb@@ ated there .
may be another dep@@ uty proposal , a legislative proposal to be introduced in the tough@@ er pen@@ alties for the ins@@ ult of the President or of a high officials .
under Egyptian law , the ins@@ ult of the President as well as government institutions are already pun@@ ish@@ able . however , under the legislative proposal , such a act would be taken with prison and banknotes , so right @-@ wing of Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
should the law be passed , this can mean up to three years imprisonment for the condemned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and assembly freedom has been in danger for many years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ id ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) arrested on 13 August 2013 as he demonstrated Egyptian polic@@ emen as he demonstrated violence against demonstr@@ ators that demonstrated against the military coup , who led to the ministers of the elected President Moh@@ ammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , just as more than 700 Protest@@ ants who were arrested at the same incident , four years in prison on a court appointment .
recently his trial was postponed on the 20th May , because the pr@@ isons according to human rights groups was postponed to the accused who accused the accused of prison in the court of court .
Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , hypo@@ theses of inter @-@ weapons possession , illegal gathering , murder and tried murder .
in another case , a criminal court spoke in G@@ iza the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Barb@@ ary free . they were indi@@ cted for their reporting to pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block on the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya place in Cairo .
the court also reduced the pen@@ alties of the journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , which were also arrested in the previously mentioned incident , 25 years to 5 years .

the document published on 21 April on the website of Na@@ wa@@ ate published document , casts a light on how the pre@@ presidential plans look like to support the law@@ suit .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia refused to assign its sources under specification of Article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an press conference , which journalists ass@@ ures the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless , he joined the District Court in Tunis on 09 May as a witness in the case .
will China force the users of social media to present their ID ?
according to new rules of the information office of the state of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users need for social media in China before they write or share messages in social media .
in addition to the rules , the registration with the full name will be required .
an@@ alysts susp@@ ect that , through the elimination anonymous comments in conversations within the social networks , it is still unclear how the authorities apply these rules .
Chinese network citizens proposed in social media to enforce these regulations only in order to protect citizens of journalism and its independence .

this name is part of a law from 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government will organise a list of online services that will organise the &quot; publication of the information . &quot; the law also allows the government to be responsible for removing content and force them on request for suspension of user data .
these web pages are currently owned websites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ se@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia two most popular social networks ) , the image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service Mail@@ .@@ ru and utz@@ ing other services .
