<seg id="1">Although I visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extremely great.</seg>
<seg id="4">As many of my generation I grew up with American films, I danced with American music, read American authors and operated his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly due to an American film journalist.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, like he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a terrible reporter, who covered the murdercal conspiracy of a oil magnet that the Supreme Court of Judgment with judges, who wanted to inclined his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "free to Method Man," "" "I was," "" "as if the absolute truth is, forget everything else, that is what I want to do with my life." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona, had only strengthened my admiration for the USA.</seg>
<seg id="10">I said, "America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose variety is so inviting you can always be that you are and it is easy to find acceptance within a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had a very warm welcome letter about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much was written about xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most exceptional aspect of his ascension is for me, how he removes with his bottlenticness.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops behind the mountain, how to say so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he expressed as a former colleague express it, and explains publicly his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, African American and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "nevertheless people have responded to his statements and consented to him for him." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes, which he won in the Republican presidential elections, was the highest number one of the party nominations ever achieved.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support these bigotte person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not bring trump and his voters to get into harmony with the people I met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">As for example my Professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, Director of the Journalism, the people from all over the world capturing, a profound human being, with whom I could talk about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also, Trumps worldview is not bound by Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the "Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours doing the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps intolerance also stands in contrast to generosity that I lived at Sandy Bahr, fighting for their lives the environment, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me as their son.</seg>
<seg id="26">Still she fits to the engagement of Kristi Kappes which always helped me with a lot of patience and grace to me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise council helped me a lot with my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the ones affected by them greatly deepened my love of America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump's going on his way to nominee Republican presidential data, they offered me a grip and the counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016, over 50 million Americans, mostly White, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt against non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The confrontation with the idea that people have voted for Trump because they were either shared with racism and fanaticism or because they were prepared to overlooked these things, I broke almost the heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to designate the Trump voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">To arrange the people said one of my friends, is exactly what has led to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and respectful and indicates an inability to understand those who act in a different way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows the people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not considered.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, of which most white are voted for Trump because they want to regain control over a country that she has disappointed?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might want to say that they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, you can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who considers the cruel decision to raise a man who look down with contempt on those who look differently from it.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "Whitelash" (Anm).: as much as "tendence of the whites against all other Ethnicities"; vocabulary from white in backlash on the whites and whiplash as it was the great Van Jones, did exactly what America has made so great.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - which faith or background one may still have, America means everyone.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this land chose as its President, twice the son of a Kenians whose history, as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">But with the election of Donald Trumps, however, is a huge part of the white America that promises this promise, saying, To Hell with multiple, religious freedom and the whole concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is again at the ruin, say it.</seg>
<seg id="46">With all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a manifestation for Hillary Clinton Mr. Khan had a vocabulary with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would have been my son, captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your America?" I asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd answered with a vostrong "No!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "no!" "" "broods the crowd." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">"have Latinos a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" answering them.</seg>
<seg id="54">Have Afro-Americans a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they called her and their voices were louder." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "if any one, who is not like you, a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">"" "he received an atmospheric and loud strong" "" "NEIN" "" "!" ""</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan joined the words: "God is thanks to Mr. Trump, that is not your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The land, for which his son was fallen, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is now Trumps Country, the message said.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan, could no longer find a place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks me my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero community in the province of Oaxaca with the children of the paraguaean town Cateura together?</seg>
<seg id="70">That the music, which is played at both places not only changed the life of the children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump, just 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city that is very popular among the tourists - but worlds from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For several years now the La Banda de MÃºsica (musibande) has been playing in the municipality: one from children and adults existing symphony orchestras, which has found their musical instruments an opportunity to overcome them surrounding poverty.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become the central interest for the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The municipality, which is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexicos, is known for its drugs abuse and banden violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a random encounter with a French pilots who started a musical project and gave the youth so a rare hopelessness.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their obligations to the music group very seriously, says the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">Once they come from school, they walk back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">You always come and play with shiny eyes and play in the Trubel, you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, Piccolo, clarinet, Oboe, flute, forest, Bongo and the Conga to play.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from trash</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 km south of Vicente Guerrero play the children of Cateura - a village that is practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of AsunciÃ³n in Paraguay's capital - on instruments that are produced from recurring waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with re-prepared instruments that consist of local solid waste materials, manufactured in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recycling under direction of Favio ChÃ¡vez began to turn parts of the waste in instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imiest violin, violas, cello, bass, guitars, saxophones, trombones, trombones and percussion that were all made out of the trash.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article from the Los Angeles Times, Favio ChÃ¡vez, a local ecologist and musician teacher of the children of Cateura at the initial time:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult, because we had no room for rehearsals, and we had to teach at the same place where parents worked in the trash. children don't know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed as Favio something that he had never seen before: one out of waste produced violin.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is a whole orchestra which plays based on instruments from reprepared material and called The Recycling Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentation called "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) features the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates around one billion tons of trash every year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and from him are the poorest people - like the people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn him into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspirational spectacle from trash-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The Orchestra has even played his music in front of Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and teamwork can successfully fight against illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo Â© FISH-i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports international, practical solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The republication takes place within an agreement with Global Voices for sharing content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, at that time it was known that this ship had already operated in liolic waters illegal fishing. before it was looking for the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were therefore seized and little inclined to welcome a legislative fratcher of this kind at its coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the compressors, Mozambique and the Seychelles was rapidly opposed to the ship. they linger for him, one of their harbors and refuse to give him a fisherman.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that you simply spend everything to stay," "" "recalls Benedict Kiilu, a leading provider of the Kenyan fishing authority. he is part of a team that discovered and followed the ship." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013 the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: it was not able to catch the fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Eventually, it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia because of plundering the fish stocks of the country.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which protects criminal practices and protects resources, FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NRO Stop illegal Fishing (Illegal Fisheries).</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar the six countries, which at that time had driven the prime minister from their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "" "" "we have eight countries that are like-minded and working together. they exchange information and are mutually exclusive where it comes to illegal fishing," "" "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trusts Project Ending illegally Fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, absent because it is extremely difficult to track down, that illegal fishing is a leading cause of the overfishing of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">Due to the obvious discontempt of existing laws, by which certain habitats and species are to be protected, the illegal fishing ecosystems can harm that have a delicate equilibrium.</seg>
<seg id="111">However, while actions against illegal fishing was once protected by bureaucratic hurdle and also by the snail, with the information between individual countries, so the actions occur nowadays in real time, with traceable at FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, the individual countries can share with each other for example lists existing licenses, news on suspects activities or details that you have noticed or experienced during a port inspector.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very attentive when they move on the open seas by means of satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This makes it possible to mark the authorities, ships that fish in Forbidden areas. also, so suspects drive routes - some such that suggest that a ship loads his shot fish on the way on other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">In the ideal case, such investigations can indicate whether the participating ships have a fishing license, where they were traveling and perhaps also whether they have a criminal.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries which are against illegal fishing, can be found on the basis of such information then the adoption of such ships in their ports. what means that the ships could not sell their charge. and that they can even be forced to pay criminal offences, as in the case of the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "then there is significant financial losses for the owner, which means that the illegal fishing catch is financially no longer worth it." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">And that's what we want to achieve, "says Per Erik Bergh, director Director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consultant company that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to win estimated 20 million USD in lost sales, which undermines the eight members of the network HISH-i every year because of illegal fishermen, which penetrate into East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishermen that attracts the region of commercial fishing from all over the world. among these also illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">These practices include actions such as sailing under false flag, counterfeit license papers, indicating fantasies, the fish-protected species and fishing in nature conservation areas.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they targeting the lack of international co-operation and make the weaknesses of a not complete organized control system" "", "says Long." "" "earlier a ship could illegal fishing and a country could then say" "" "you darker to walk my harbour." ""</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say "Come to me". "and just this legale loophole tries to close FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its foundation FISH-i has participated in more than 30 studies of suspects ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has criminal networks uncovered, distributed counterfeit licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has followed rugged ships tracked and found.</seg>
<seg id="128">Because of its cooperation with Interpol, the international authority to fight crime, FISH-i can share information on illegal fishing over large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "" "" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organized crime," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system which should help FISH-i, suspects ships concise.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo with friendly permission of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is always developed, helps also to convert the illegal ships that likes to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "" "" "illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide its activities and its position," "" "says Duncan Copeland, boss analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO, which also deals with fishing data and FISH technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships will turn off their automatic identification systems, which they can no longer be Georgian by satellite.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland therefore helps to build a system that connects different information levels together. it should help FISH-i to find criminals with larger precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team of African nations can actually influence the undoubtedly global issue of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened together with Google and the marine protection organisation Oceana, the platform Global Fishing Watch: a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed worldwide by means of the position of each traceable ship worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "together with the neighbours to get a better picture of what is doing - that is simply sense," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources for investigation." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this at a global level." "" "Pew Charitable trusts has a similar project to run where a global system allows the persecution of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities not only felt crime, but they are also deterred.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that have been confiscated in the past without a license and barely had consequences of consequences, now they know that they are observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i participated in the meantime a 33% increase in fishing sales, since fishing boats to buy more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia helped, Greko 1 ascended, the inspectors found there on board tow, whose use is prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo with friendly permission of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "other countries will notice these successes." "" "the effect is so strong that now also other countries do copy," "" "says Kiilu." "" "in West Africa several hundred million dollars will disappear by illegal fishing." ""</seg>
<seg id="148">"" "there are six countries gathered in 2015, to the so-called West Africa Task Force." "" "they now fight illegal fishing, according to exactly the same model as FISH-i." "" "with certainty, the aim is to create even more such initiatives and structures in other regions," "" "says Copeland." ""</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's youngest member country will report his first big triumph: in October it was Greko 1, a ship that was under false flag. and not only was the ship used without a license and have been used towing networks, which are now prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the ship was also penetrated also in Forbidden waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "" "with the take of measures against Greko 1, the strong sign that it is against illegal fishing." "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time evidence that such special, collaborative approach to protect the oceans actually works throughout the world sea.

<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and published here with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to watch the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentinian city of CÃ³rdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">In the meantime, Quijano said now in the context of the great La Perla-Ribera process in the province of CÃ³rdoba to his father.</seg>
<seg id="201">In the process, which ended on 24 August 2016, crimes were examined, which were committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano has not chosen his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Starting at the brush, the same name as his father carry up to the brutal military installations in jail in La Perla, which he observed in the age of 15, he has suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">34 years long he kept the secret of secret for himself.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation then I believed that was fine.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a salary.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child of 15 years one does not notice that you are manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">I could not realize that my father was a thief, Folterer and murderer.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was gendarmerry. during the Argentinian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a time of State aphorism, his father from 1976 to 1978 deputy commander of secrecy 141 in jail in La Perla.</seg>

<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijanos son, a man who had experienced over the years the extent of the atrocities that he had experienced as a boy, and who said before a federal court against his own father.</seg>

<seg id="222">The abbreviation ERP stands for EjÃ©rcito Revolucionario del Pueblo, - revolutionists of the people's military - the military arm of the revolutionists of Argentina.</seg>

<seg id="226">On the military base I had to destroy Papers who had heard the prisoners.</seg>

<seg id="233">All of this was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">He gave me a little into a ceiling and commanded to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a big clump of silver.</seg>
<seg id="235">On that day I went to the other end of Baracke where the stolen items were completed and signed me with a guard.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">There, the prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">I pointed out and saw a lawn where people were tortured.</seg>
<seg id="239">She looked like a dirt bed and metal springs.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that they fortified that one end of a cable. the other end was attached to the body of the person who was just captivated there.</seg>

<seg id="352">The daily Kyoto Shimbun wrote in Kyoto:</seg>
<seg id="353">"how could it come to such an English translation?</seg>

<seg id="357">The police of the Prefecture of Kyoto apologized for the translation errors. furthermore, they stated that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published.</seg>

<seg id="359">"" "" "" "we sincerely hope that older people felt offended by the insufficient correction (the translation) of our part," said the police. "" "</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">To place you need two important skills: passive voice knowledge to understand the output text and to commit active language skills to transfer him into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter demands the active mastery of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers in the case. in general, the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the language language - native speakers should be.</seg>
<seg id="379">So a French language should translate as an example from English to French - not from French into English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ workers with English as a mother tongue, which could make translations into English. this may be lacking of understanding of the surplus, cost reasons, or the relatively small number of English native speakers, to learn the Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies that even have no foreign employees, have translations nevertheless left-to-internal. then the Japanese staff will be considered the best to be in translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Automated translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The distorted and puzzling sentences, which arise by machine translation, show that this technique can not replace a long one human translator. this applies to some languages very special.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strange English wordings in Japan, including the puzzling prints, often used T-shirts or bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not read or not to be understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr users Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Interpreting errors do not like to be a jewelry or at least harmless. however, by large companies or by the government who have the funds to guarantee higher standards, we can expect more careful translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">In the future, the city of Kyoto takes a serious source of its translations into the future.</seg>

<seg id="393">Later, other users wrote that the internet presence of VPITV and El Capitolio TV will be no longer available.</seg>
<seg id="394">Also other online radio stations overtook recordings of the protests in Caracas, which were organized by oppositionists who resist by the government of NicolÃ¡s Maduros.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests began in early April after the Supreme Court was dissolved the parliament and transferred the Parliament's tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos DÃ­az, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a Traceroutes. he pointed out that the connection was curved, and recommended the users, VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the Internet.</seg>

<seg id="401">Traditional media have been hesitant since 2014 in the reporting of protests. at that time, the Commission was on telecommunication to them with money and lockings if they continue to report on demonstrations as the Commission saw this as a "call to violence."</seg>
<seg id="402">Without cable TV and informative national TV channels I signed up again at @ vivoplaynet.</seg>

<seg id="404">The local NGO VEsinfiltro confirmed that not only Vivoplay is inaccessible through a blockage of the Domain Name System (DNS), but also two more online transmitters. this also affects the Internet site, at which the National Assembly carries its meetings.</seg>
<seg id="405">Previous researches of the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had surrendered that the local internet provider will sometimes use DNS. it is a technique that is incompatible with the DNS server requests specified by certain domains.</seg>
<seg id="406">When a website is blocked by the DNS server, the server is inaccurate or denied the request at the call of such a website.</seg>

<seg id="410">Eight hours later he was released, and VPITV went back on show.</seg>

<seg id="458">But they all went further to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina has been sent as Criadita in the capital Asuncion.</seg>
<seg id="460">In the house of her employers Alvarenga worked between four and six hours every day.</seg>
<seg id="461">They had to share the time so that you still have time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">She stood up every morning at five o'clock and prepared the breakfast for their employer.</seg>
<seg id="463">For example, they purified the fridge, panned the living room, polished the furniture and disinfect the floor.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was at the end she went home and had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="465">The more she finished with learning, the more free time she had.</seg>
<seg id="466">But also this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers.</seg>
<seg id="467">Alvarenga says she had never had hungry, but I also didn't get any food. "I was allowed to pick up more books from the library of the landlord as a meal from the fridge," reminds them.</seg>
<seg id="468">The library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord, a former military and sympathizers of the Partido Liberal, a liberal party, which was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who was in power from 1954 to 1989.</seg>
<seg id="469">At some evenings of the landlord Alvarenga, next to him stand and guides from Oppositionings as "Sendero" or "El Pueblo."</seg>
<seg id="470">He tried to persuade them to convince the reports of the official media on the regime of the dictator.</seg>
<seg id="471">He kept her for intelligent, but did not hold him with her. "the landlord had found someone who heard, while he spoke about politics," she says.</seg>
<seg id="472">"they allowed me not often to visit my family because they were the opinion that I would go there again" bad habits. "thus they said that Alvarenga belongs to the Indigenous Group of the ReÃ­, at home their native language ReÃ­ would speak.</seg>
<seg id="473">"" "" "" "their Lord feared that they had made the education they had enabled to lose." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="474">But it was totally clear that she got for everything she got from them with their hard work.</seg>
<seg id="475">Also at school Alvarenga discriminated against. "one thing that is almost never spoken, are harassbing and the rails that cries are exposed to school when they go to school.</seg>
<seg id="476">Because the other children have parents, they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents, a criadita.</seg>
<seg id="477">I couldn't invite anyone to my home. I had no friends house at school or in the neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="478">In my youth, in the time where friendships develop, I feel particularly clear that I belonged to no group.</seg>
<seg id="479">The isolation was the worst of everything, "explains Alvarenga.</seg>

<seg id="487">The ad got five "Likes" and many comments.</seg>
<seg id="488">A woman from the village Ãemby wrote that she had been a eleventh girl and gave her telephone number.</seg>

<seg id="504">On the basis of the law, a place would be set up, which is necessary to use citizens and to use social media.</seg>
<seg id="505">Within six months of acceptance of the law, users and users have to register on the website of the site with their correct names and recruitment numbers to be able to use social networks.</seg>
<seg id="506">If it fails to do this, that might be a punishment of up to six months in jail or an ATM.</seg>
<seg id="507">The bill, which consists of six paragraids and divided into local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as "any application that runs through the Internet and used to communicate with others by means of voice, video channels and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law is enforced if the draft is not evidence of how Egyptian authorities should not be imposed on the fact that the Egyptian government currently does not register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure regulation on the level of social media companies.</seg>
<seg id="509">Riyad Abdul Sattar, parliamentators and Patrons of the Legislative situation, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users and users received a username and password by the firewall, blocked Facebook. "</seg>

<seg id="514">I feel strong in the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt with regard to things that deal with technology.</seg>

<seg id="518">"" "" "" "to be adopted by the law, the draft must first be discussed in the legislature of the Parliament and the constitutional committees before it goes into plenary debate." ""</seg>

<seg id="527">Why is this particular way of leopards so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">Like Raza shows in the video, the Persian Leopard is the only surviving beast in the Kurdish ecosystem, and the health and the prosperity of the ecosystem depends also on that a big predattier exists.</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian leopards actually in the wild bobsled is low and goes against zero. when the team in video therefore makes sure that she's a recording of a great cat in the camera-all, Raza breaks in pure joy.</seg>

<seg id="544">At the beginning of March 2017, the newspaper Kahoku Shimpo, the advances that have been achieved over the past six years to rebuild the lives of those who were affected by the "" "" threefold catastrophe "" "," a tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima disaster. "" "</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, located in the prefecture of Miyagi. the prefecture of Miyagi was a strict prefecture of Japan in the north-east, which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of thousands of people from Miyagi and neighbouring prehistoric times Fukushima and Iwate were forced to disappear, because the tsunami had all the coastal towns disappear from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">In addition, the prefecture of Fukushima still lived a nuclear accident, already alone had to leave 160 000 inhabitants its houses.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows from a local point of view which advances six years later to rebuild the life of the local resident.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper contains both statistics of Japanese reconstructions and survey results of affected people themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The housing situation in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned spare parts (which was given, saigai kouei juutaku) in the Prefect Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate were finished.</seg>
<seg id="552">The biggest success of the three prefectures, Miyagi recorded, here 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima is formed by 70 percent the final light.</seg>
<seg id="554">However, one always makes every effort to relocate six years after the catastrophe, evacuated by Behavid of Behavid.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the triple catastrophe almost 80 000 people saw themselves forced to live in Behavid.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016 still 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate were living in such containers.</seg>
<seg id="557">Nearly 40 percent in 2011 evacuated from Fukushima still live in emergency accommodation, whereas Miyagi was successful here. over 75 per cent of the evacuated, which was hauled by the disaster in Behavid, were converted into final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwata the number is here at 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of works and everyday life in the three concerned fectures</seg>
<seg id="560">As the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper was able to establish 1074 of 1100 schools, which were affected by the misfortune, their pforten to December 2016 were re-opened, which makes almost 98 per cent of schools of three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, industrial reconstruction is far more difficult in the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="562">While almost 100 percent of the fishing harbors in Iwate and Miyagi are now back in operation, Fukushima only 30 per cent of the fishery harbors have resumed its operation.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the atomare accident, moved in the three prefectures of agricultural land large-scale fires.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas, using only 66 percent of the agricultural land in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed agricultural land in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">"" "it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the atomic fact, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed Ackerland of Fukushima, are located in the" nuclear power zone "" "." "" "</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, the tourism expanded again and again, but here Fukushima still remains backward.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist figures in Miyagi and Iwate are back to 90 percent on the same stand as before the unhappiness. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only have 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants, it seems more difficult to earn their livelihoods.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to be able to find an overall picture, the newspaper introduced numerous surveys under the local population and among the evacuated people. they asked them about the state of rebuilding and also how their empathy against the tsunami risk has changed.</seg>
<seg id="571">In their introduction to the article the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo led a survey to bring more about the tsunami consciousness under the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey brought that 83.1 per cent of the local inhabitants have taken measures to be prepared for the future earthquake and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of the respondents, that still not enough in the catastrophes of disasters.</seg>
<seg id="575">As it stands for those who had to evacuated from the prefecture of Fukushima</seg>
<seg id="576">In its output to the anniversary of the earthquake, Kahoku Shimpo Zeitung has strengthened its attention to the position of the evacuated from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima not only had to experience the tremendous earthquake and the devastating tsunami experience, no, the prefecture of Fukushima was also a witness to the worst, catastrophenols, atomic accident, the Japan ever had to experience.</seg>
<seg id="578">Of 160 000 Evans from Fukushima, nearly 63 000 people were moved into areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016 a little more than 23 000 people came back to Fukushima in permanent replacement houses.</seg>
<seg id="580">After the booth of 2017 there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima off their home-prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In disaster areas most of the evacuated areas are most of the evacuated ones who still have to return to Behavid, Iwate and Fukushima with massive building projects. here is building projects, the part of the Olympic Games are to take place in Tokyo.</seg>

<seg id="585">These global connections are important as they challenge our prejudices to expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small.</seg>

<seg id="628">It is two years ago when the activities were laid down in the sugar cane factories.</seg>
<seg id="629">After the awakening, the sugar cane industry stood still in the region, and the factory lost after and after its installations, until only the smells of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to be reinvent.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some are rarely the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resorated and commutes daily to the factories that even grind.</seg>

<seg id="634">He heard that it is in the east of the region of sugar factories that have been in operation after a long time, because they were preserved.</seg>
<seg id="635">This was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene reminds themselves exactly that in MaÃ±ali would be preserved the sugar cane factory, but the promise has not been kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugars industry already resisted the plagues, the case of socialism, the low market prices, the inefficiency, the bad administrative decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016 the production was 1.6 million tons of sugar, less than 1910 produced quantity.</seg>
<seg id="639">The message would have been a motive for the country a few decades ago, but the bad yield are already no news anymore.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugars?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway station of the community already saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically outdated, and hardly competitive, they were unportable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to focus on producing the most efficient factories, the annual production objectives amounted to 4 million tons.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories that can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution to unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of the sugars plantations and the rise rise in the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless the sugar price rose from about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">"" "from 2017 until 2025 the price of unrefined sugar between 15 and 16 Centavos will be issued, according to the report published report" "" "agricultural perspectives" "" "by the OECD and FAO, the Economic and Food Organization of the United Nations." ""</seg>

<seg id="654">In the following years, the breastfeeding of a total of 98 sugar cane factories, more than 65 million people received their full salaries for further education.</seg>

<seg id="658">Almost all respondents are in the same opinion: not one of them have been informed that the factory was shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order to get the place they formed a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first closing year, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was officially distributed documents, which would only be removed with regard to the parts that would be removed, addressing the addresses and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Uluru Rosales del Toro, only the minister could dismiss any withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From there the responsibility was handed over and the letters were more and more common.</seg>

<seg id="692">Young people of the First Nations communities in Canada deal with topics that are important for them. they do it by means of Hip Hop, thanks to a number of walking-workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan-Tour have been offering mobile audio studios directly to schools and youth centers in order to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live recording sessions.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by educators David Hodges who lives in Montreal and worked in North Quebec with ten Cree communities and then worked together with the Cree Hip-Hop Group The NorthStars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop is thus rising that the young participants in conversations like "cultural identity, language, debate, love, self-acceptance," or whatever they always comes to mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos, where young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team worked with other first Nations communities in the British Columbia province and was invited to organise similar workshops with the tribe of Winnebago in the U.S. state of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Akilak' yoo in the area of the tribe of the Kitsumkalum First nation in British Columbia, for example, the story of the Highway 16, also called "Highway of tears", at which nearly two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases have been largely unsolved.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First nation uses the motif of a video player to mediate, how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite influences from globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in India-indigenous languages, although the young people do not always master the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation recorded, the chorus is sung on Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved here received a little help from Gary Jolly from Northstars Hip-Hop Group, who gave them a Strophe in dialect Eastern dialect Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebookside of N'we Jinan stands at the Strophe in outlines, as well as a translation into English, which is translated into German here:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like no one would ever be interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to go on earth further my days</seg>
<seg id="707">That is the day when you take our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we as youth have lost our path in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise up one day one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">How they can grow and lead to our youth as well</seg>
<seg id="712">So they can do what they are determined by the creator</seg>
<seg id="713">In the commentary on the reader, the reader and feeder of the Cree-language Kevin Brousseau also adds a post and adds the Strophe in syllable (which is also published on his blog and published here with permission):</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan one can see almost every restaurant plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers what exactly is standing on the menu, will be displayed close to the entrance shokua.puru (which was used, "" "" plastic models of dishes "" "") of each spectacle, which is served in this restaurant. "" "</seg>
<seg id="720">The customers look at these plastic meals and decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is an entire industry dedicated to the production of these plastic meals.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the tokiosk district Kappabashi there are a variety of these small businesses that produce even those plastic dishes made by the German filmmakers Wim Wenders in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese, these plastic meals are so common that they don't even find them any more. a new trend is turning it today in a showy phone accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver Matome published the blogger itinii series of social media links and photos, which show this unusual twist with the shokuhin Sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new with plastic chaired mobile phone bands, as they are shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu Kaufhaus.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods have turned to kitschy objects, as in this case, cooling cabinet magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few shocues cooling magnets for a new exhibition at Tokyo-Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom of essences will increasingly become more awake.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case, a kaans-don was turned (a popular travel bowl with seafood) into a mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as a mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also made this part for the exhibition in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that includes your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to watch like an apple, with a candle for the mobile phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And that is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile phones and mobile phone designers make your own artwork. in this case ikura or salmon is used, a popular topping which is served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "there is someone who would say:" "" "wow, cool, now I can do my cell phone with salmon?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I believe I will probably be the one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic geries can also take a less appetizing shape to surprise for example colleagues or family members unpleasant.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our new mobile phone-stands has the shape of melted ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also travel balls (onigiri), earrings and palms from dry salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">Further scissary plastic meals can be found at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter the hashtag #, you are looking for...</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports in- and foreign media on the infamous "struggle against drug trading" in Mexico, the most misses and transmissions regularly only in statistics. however, these reflect not at all the extent of the human tragedy, which this battle takes place.</seg>
<seg id="750">The report on drug bosses such as El Chapo GuzmÃ¡n, the head of the Sinaloa-Kartell, squeezed the stories of the victims of the conflict perfectly into the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">On the day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks upon the sorrow, or to the churches that have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Behind each body, behind every bone report in the hundreds of gearing tombs, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never be cure.</seg>
<seg id="753">"" "this is why the Mexican news portal Animal PolÃ­tico das Digital Project" Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco "" "" (German: "" "" with drug outlets we learn ")" "" to give these victims a voice and tells stories of people who put in the struggle between prosecution authorities and cartels.

<seg id="754">Animal PolÃ­tico describes the project so:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime can not be afraid to fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are much deeper.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, if businesses close, because they are threatened by drug dealers, and whole communities therefore have to drive many kilometers to buy something like milk.</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of the victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video with the title "Vidas que cambian por el miedo" (German: "as fear lives") tells exactly these stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">One main character is Guadalupe, a father who searches for every weekend of secret tombs after his son.</seg>

<seg id="771">You stand out the insurance of my Father, but it does not get paid out because that require a steroid request.</seg>
<seg id="772">Where should we get that? "</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprender a vivir con el Narco," why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">We do not only have to show the faces of those who ask the fear. we must show the international community the conflicts, the fragility and the state of government.</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high risks.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reader of Animal PolÃ­tico, wrote this contribution from Taxco, in the federal state of Guerrero in central mexko.</seg>
<seg id="778">Your contribution reminds us that violence should never be considered normal, no matter what type it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">Disease and Sensory journalism, I have already known for some years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I'm coming to newspaper kiosks every day and see the front pages with pictures that actually only come from a textbook for criminology or from actors.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I have the feeling as if I am the only thing that is attached or sad. it affects how a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or see this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">It further writes:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it is not normal that my 10-year cousin thinks that he wants Narco (German: drug dealers) if it is great. and it is also not normal that people listen songs about the "heroism" of the offenders when they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is as if they were those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that they might have something like that.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness if stories led to mere numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">The invariance of the human being is incredible for me when the death of six people and the nesting of 43 students in a neighbor that they were justified. "</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they try to argue that they remain spared by such tragedies, if they do not stir and silent.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the post "four months of pressors in the capital city: how a family with threats has been looted. in it, it describes how armed crime month for month money from their business, until it was not only destroyed by the business but also their family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how some people can change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain is never passing, the trauma remains, the fear comes up again when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers also.</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The further we are removed, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">It included her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when they are kidnapped or kill.</seg>
<seg id="798">I asked myself in these terrible days if wines would dissolve my deep-rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to crying. I have to learn to live with the ache.</seg>
<seg id="799">The journalist Mario GutiÃ©rrez Vega published the article "The Forgotten Children of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez: one of the generations drawn generation."</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions on how: who cares for the child of a mixed woman and a man who murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow up in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexicos?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents take care of them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a commodity and he tells you had to teach himself how to make a egg cooks, potatoes brows, tortillas warm makes and 'Chichi' for the babies who live with him. this is his name for the preparation of the vial of water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for the whole life of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old she said that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood had been over two years earlier than he just saw some blocks from his home, which saw the bloody serche of his father, which was shot by armed men from a squandering car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in JuÃ¡rez saw this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 when violence through organised crime and the struggle against it was mixed with the already existing social problems in JuÃ¡rez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010 JuÃ¡rez the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murder according to the citizen of the citizen of public security and the government of the Government of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the prosecutor called 3103 Morde. this corresponds to the cut 8,5 Morden per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of thousands of hundred thousand stories, which leaves the organised crime in Mexico and penetrate into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories are still living in the face of new headlines. but this project is reminiscent of those that we may not forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco," Animal PolÃ­tico 2015 called the data journalism project Narcodata, whose aim is to portray the complex information behind the written struggle against drug outlets, which has tortured the country in the last four decades, in understandable manner.</seg>

<seg id="819">But how is the year after something the first time? content in social media, whether true or untrue, tends to continue to persist.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let's take this photo of a terrible accident in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) seven years ago.</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first publication it was misleading to advertised tragedies which actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false pairing of image and event - "false description" or "false context" in terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - denied not the fact that there are abundant reporting about events in the DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions concerning our desire for images on messages.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010 a gas trolley wagons the place Sange in the east of the DR Congo, crushed and exploded. in doing so, 230 people came to life.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war in Africa, Africa has been neglected and devastated for years and devastated. the streets in the region became a dangerous pathway full of strokes, which were difficult to drive.</seg>
<seg id="827">Ironically, the petrol-wagons fell victim to the victim.</seg>
<seg id="828">Administrative guardians described a fireball, the incubating homes, including a cinemas nearby, which was full of people that looked at the football championship.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses twisted and disguised corpses scattered in the streets scattered.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burnt to the imfession.</seg>
<seg id="831">A picture with the title "This is Nigeria." from the Imgur users mystical Monkey, 12 January 2015.more photos of the incident form the gray scenes of this day.</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example for this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of hollow body that are positioned on the ground while people look at them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story does not find its end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years, the same photo was engendered several times on social media, blogs and other platforms, but cannot be attributed to the related tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>

<seg id="839">Houses and stores have been burnt down and corpses in streets and bushes.</seg>

<seg id="841">"" "but the figures could not be confirmed." "" "no one stayed back to count corpses," "" "said a citizen to Human Rights Watch." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many were destroyed, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only on satellite images the subsequent time could be portrayed.</seg>
<seg id="844">The occasion for the attack was also unsolved, but the army protectionery in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerian and trying to win the Boko Haram, country (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture from the Democratic Republic of the Congo came again, as evidence of the fact and potential scope of the attack was presented:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre to 2,000 people took place two days to Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">You are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this abusive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of misdescriptions; Africa Check has documented assignment of Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases, the picture was taken as a testament to massages.</seg>
<seg id="852">One step further brings personal comments such as this example, the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to deliver arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The picture from Sange also joined in combination with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a lightning, published by the United Nations, those who were able to flee blows, rape and several dead, some through burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported by the violence against the Rohingya, Posts, like the following on, which brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from a suction Arab news page, which was more susceptible to the president of Myanmars Thein, monks and politicians would have participated in the assassination of the Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the picture from the DR Congo to show this information.</seg>

<seg id="934">Suggested these mood of mis- and falseinformation that actual atrocities are untrue and narrowly the real Greys of what actually happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo, in Nigeria and in Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of violent images has already been debated in detail (here for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that the remittance of images of a refusal to recognize the tragedy. sometimes these images are requested even by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern is that violent images reader and audience desensitise and take them the ability to feel empathy (such as this study, which examined, such as violent media act to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot regarding violent representations in the news media to discuss is fact that they are indispensable for the current message reporting.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists experiment, because with algorithms in order to support the fight against "Fake News". you will think thoroughly about situation where an image is something suggested, which actually can also be solved by the context or on completely misused way.</seg>

<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the initiative Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS) is the detection of stories in their original language a possible response to it.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported a short overview of another initiative by Steven Bird, the Unreplaceable Blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">"" "" "" "however, the focus of TLS is not on the written word, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and become the language variety of large cities." ""</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syrian Palestinian web developer Bassel Khartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi, has been mixed since over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and relatives were continuing the campaign for his freedom and remember the contributions he has made for an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: publica, the annual conference on digital culture, which will be aligned in Berlin, devoted an event to the # FreeBassel campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1186">MÃ©lanie Dulong de Rosnay, a researcher at the CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara RÃ¼hling, business manager at Book Sprints, a publisher of the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective enquiry (The cost of freedom: collective postresearch).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book that has been published last year and is available to license freely, contains a number of sets that deal with free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it is called:</seg>
<seg id="1190">"" "" "" "this book wants to discuss how motions are constructed for free knowledge and what the real costs are connected with which this is connected." ""</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge, have page on page to look over the fog who surrounds our newseds and to create some sense from our different experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, beloved and celebrating Internet-volunteers, who has been detained in Syria since 15 March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was painted out of the directory of Adra prison, where he sat on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then, we have no information about its current state or residence.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title Collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice that push for his release and want to know him back in his normal life and freedom.</seg>
<seg id="1196">To see how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us have to start thinking about their own fates, deeds and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we decide to do?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we abandoned in this process of temporarily extreme convictions?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The Webdeveloper for Open Source and digital activist has been in custody of Syrian government agencies since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015 Bassel was transferred from the Adra-prison, a non-military institution, transferred to an unknown place.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and Angentin Noura Ghazi, reported that the "military police Bassel had taken on the basis of a" strict secret "command of the military Court from his cell in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that she had been contacted by persons on November 12, 2015, who presented themselves as an insider of the Assad administration and presented them from a alleged death struggle against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">His residence and condition remains unknown but still unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Basle played a crucial role in attracting access to the Internet and knowledge of the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, Technologist and at the moment the head of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel writes on the sides 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Basle cultural prototype was looking forward to the work he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyras virtually.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the crossroads of numerous civilizations and here merge Greek-roman architecture types with hiesful traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Bassel could not know that ten years after he started working with this work, the IS would put everything in doing this architecture, which is not only embodied the cultural heritage of Sysriens, but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This strike into the digital archaeology and conservation has created a period of time that will be invaluable for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Ironically, Bassel could not finish this project yet.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my entire life with it, dream of freedom and he taught me to embrace them.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel put me English in, even when he was already in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with every one who has asked. he taught others Indetained to read and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel has opened the gate to technology. he taught me to use both computer and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also brought together other instices as they use computers, at least theoretically, without having actually kept one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waste (waiting), a promoter that she wrote to her husband in the years 2012 until 2015 when he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura have worked together on the book for a year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">They muged the lyrics to him if they visited him and he put them out of the Arabic to English.</seg>

<seg id="1255">Mosambians reacted with anger upon a corruption in which a government member returned after half of his sentence to the workplace in the state apparatus, where the corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is a Diodino Cambaza, arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment together with four other defendants (around 800 000 Euro) for 22 years.</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds from the Mozambique airports, whose advice Cambaza stood between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 because of good guidance and immediately requested his resetting into the company, which happened on 19 April then also.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with an opinion of the General Administrative Bar of the Republic, which claims the application, there would be no obstacles reason for Cambaza, again to refer to his old post as the company did not accomplish disciplinarders after his detention.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many citizens are not doing the action well.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Centre for Public integrity (Centro de Integridade PÃºblica, shortly CIP), an local institution committed to public transparency, condemned into an interview with the Deutsche Welle to make the decision of the company, the director again:</seg>
<seg id="1262">Represents a return in the fight against corruption and clarifies the lack of transparency and is even a return with regard to the efforts of our legal system, so the CIP.</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we take to notice is that the company should have a disciplintra in opposition to the contravention of the opposition.</seg>
<seg id="1264">However, the company apparently declining and prompted no appropriate legal steps to apply the appropriate functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">EgÃ­dio Vaz, a significant voice in the Mosque social media, this behaviour also refuses and considers the case as a "resist":</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza was a competent type, he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to sentence in prison and that half of which had dinner.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could keep paid lectures and motivating speeches, he could consult and keep his image polish.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since it is incompetent, he has agreed to be integrated into the company that he helped to cause damage.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza is happy to pay for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Contradictory!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mozambians and student of Political Science in Brazil says that the director had no morals:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza was rewarded by the state, because he inquired it I can't believe that one has been rewarded with someone in such a way that has already cowarmed the state.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza is missing the morals and serve the state, * he had already served a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead he only serves themselves at the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as a handele has become an inexhaustible source of money and the state itself is tired of this man who was recharged and ultimately sentenced to a long prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey ZeÃºte preferred to remember the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, recall that a thief belongs to prison:</seg>

<seg id="1289">According to the statements by Facebook-users in Myanmar, the famous Social Network took their posts on the net because they included the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although the origin of the word is still discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East-Indian origin or in general as adjective. "</seg>
<seg id="1291">"" "Facebook censored the word" "" "Kalar" "" "or you are looking for (in Burmese script) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma within the social network." ""</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radicalal nationalist movements of the word has given an extremely valuable connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that mostly used by Ultra-nationalists as a hate speech against Muslims, which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to fight-hate language in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of sensual content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'may normally be associated with racism but the word itself is not automatically calling-hate language.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that even posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts in the purpose of its use.</seg>
<seg id="1297">In addition, there are several burial words with the different meanings that have the same letter as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, chair is written on Burmese also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters, as well as other words like 'Kalar Pae' (Spage), 'Kalar oat' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebookier Aung Kaat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends has been erased today because he enthuses the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends in a rich way if they knew how he could alleviate his back pain by doing a vocabulary.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The proposition ku la - "healing" (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression very, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different responses to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Hit is the opinion that she will reduce Al-speech National Nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook analytic must be that it must distribute all posts to disseminate racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">"" "Facebook deletes the word" "" "Kalar" "" "not manually." ""</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filtered the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The detection will not understand what you write on Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead, the post office is carefully to analyse and control it by checking the next words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar Pae" (mediaeval).</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good is that these three-legged nationalists spread to spread the hate-language, a pretty good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcised its nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to all who disseminate information, may not stop the efficiency of this strategy for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and Wechat have proven that the censorship of keywords often become a kiss and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks will simply begin to use a new word or an alternative notation of the zenith of words to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described as Facebook began to delete his posts when he only wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' from the social network is banished:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I was aware of this new Directive on Facebook, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the Word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post office has been removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to the Liken, posts and parts of content for 24 hours, because of the post "Facebook Community standards did not escape."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has a variety of posts away from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate of radicalal nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post has been removed, which has nothing to do with hate language:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author told his mind about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook would have to do more before the beginning of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community to ask advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook might have a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma by their platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "" "" "such words to censze will only bring more hatred within the different communities." ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">"" "it also seems as if they have started it without local context or technical support and so words like" "" "chair" "" "or" "" "inheritance curry" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they have made mistakes, they did not attempt the falsely deleted Posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits, they would like to make a great turnover, this would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks automatic censorship has taken care of much mockery among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users now make use of Facebook funny and consciously write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate language to see if their posts are taken from the net.</seg>

<seg id="1343">The children's toe is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago.</seg>
<seg id="1344">On 9 June 2017, the Parliament approved a law unanimously decided to offer this practice so that the saving age is now under 18.</seg>
<seg id="1345">Before this change of the spouse some members held the dualistic and Muslim religious communities in practice, and in May 2016, brother Harrypersad Maharaj, the leader of interreligious organization (IRO), a group, the representatives of the various religious groups of the country gathered that the state does not interfere, since that, age do not determine the maturity. "</seg>
<seg id="1346">This happened, regardless of the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contractual partner of the UN's rights law, the minors as, each person under the age of 18. "</seg>
<seg id="1347">Statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the share of children who were married with 15, in Trinidad and Tobago 2.8 percent, and with 18 it was 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011 the statistical office of the country confirmed that of 1997-2007 more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online-petitions and social media movements that strives to create laws to infront, followed at the foot and graceful of great support. undoubtedly, they help to bring this outcome.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nevertheless, not everything went smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">A Hindu-leader, for example had no concerns, the critics of the children's before, they should, are damn't care of their own affairs. "</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition sort of tension in this actually uncomplicated thing, and eventually we got doubts as to whether the opposition would agree to the Legislative bill at all.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But at the beginning of 2017 the legislative draft was decided against the children's toe - despite four senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent who was discussed at the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him a law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the President of the country must agree and announce the law.</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the senators of the country on Facebook gave an status update, which Leslie-Ann Boiselle was again posted on Instagram:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill of law against children's toe was decided in the Representatives of 35 votes against it, and no one decided against it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">After having been decided before in the Senate, the draft can now become the law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of social media users was enthusiastic because the laws were finally changed at the children's toe.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook-member Lovell Francis, who was a prime minister in the Ministry of Education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It has too much time and unnecessary just needed to disguise the core of the thing, but do you know what? the children's toe is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago now and that is almost every price.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel Jackson think it was definitely long enough to create the practice, Lara Quentrall-Thomas overjoyed that the day was finally come:</seg>
<seg id="1362">Public Status Update on Facebook by Lara Quentrall- Thomas, which said:,, Excellent news!</seg>
<seg id="1363">The Austrian Act has been decided.</seg>

<seg id="1365">Folder Mutota, whom the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD) listens to a civil society that openly spoke openly about how important the adoption of the law was, noted:</seg>
<seg id="1366">The saving age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of the religious confession of 18 years.</seg>
<seg id="1367">The draft to the amendment of the Act has been adopted today, on 9 June 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1368">In the House of Representatives there are 41 members and of which 35 were present at the vote.</seg>
<seg id="1369">"" "" "" "all members who were opposed to the law have voted for the law." ""</seg>

<seg id="1375">But a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Maharaj therefore, the Secretary General of Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the most famous Hindu-organization of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1376">Months ago, Maharaj has proclaimed his intention to undertake judicial steps, the law should be passed and he seems to redeem his promises.</seg>
<seg id="1377">During the general state of Paris Al rawi, a feeder of the law, said, unless Maharaj on the law should act, most social media users would like to tackle the debate on the subject differently.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell suggested:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Dear sat, if we, instead of talking about the discussion, in a way that only panic and disgrace may say that the state, our daughters, protects them that they may be of great, hard-minded men who are accountable to them, would you then ready to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you believe it is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">However, whether it comes to a judicial approach against the law or not, this legislation is an important step - however, there are still places in the world where children's toe are legal or still the norm, though there are laws which they say.</seg>

<seg id="1391">The English-speaking Wikipedia-page was presented on 18 January 2012, contradictory to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright law in the United States, internationally blacked.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">Since over a month now Turkey unlock the popular and on the crowdsourcing principle based encyclopedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day by day is clearer how important the platform for users is to find helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporter and fans of TV series are opposed to blocking.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many technologists versed Internet users are used to use renal tools for blocked websites (an up-to-date article from the New York Times reported that Turkey has the third largest VPN emvalence in the world), most usual Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been lowered since 2008 by Wikipedia, as recently published in a published report by Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society on Harvard University, will take place regular blockages of the Internet since 2007, after the Internet law (No. 5651) was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">In China, Turkey is the second most famous country in the world, when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform continues to be blocked, there are now several Mirrorpages (pages that mirror the content from Wikipedia and frequently updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), as the platform passed all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized Peer-to-peer network (i.e. machine-machine connections) which is not based on the system of domain names and therefore makes a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is not available in spite of its statutory prohibition.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blogpost IPFS reported about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After we have heard the news (via the blocking from Wikipedia), we put everything from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, the possibility to read the contents on decentralized and distributed way.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to view at least all Wikipedia content, even if they cannot achieve the website www.wikipedia.org.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS was also assumed that this step was independent of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is only about screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to handle the sperm.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansiklopedi.org, a Mirrorside of Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that everyone can use to host similar Mirrorpages when in the respective country Wikipedia is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported subhashish Panigradii - Global Voices, as well as employees at Mozilla in the Panigradii's Open Speaks "Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a Mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">One accesses another URL that is not the original. that which one can see is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">In essence, the server directs the request to the right Wikipedia page so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself then when they are locked in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was with the photos that he saw around him, never satisfied. they were blurred with poorly positioned motifs and seasoned colours.</seg>
<seg id="1418">The motivated him to carry himself a camera with himself and try to settle the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">Then he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar strives to bring down to the international stage as an animal world.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his homeland right next to the Chitwan National Park, offering him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that steer attention to Nepalan animal world.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described Facebook, like him this first-class situation helps in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Parks, a world natural heritage. what could it be better for a passionate wildlife photographers!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested at home as I suddenly called Navaraj (the manager of Chitwan Gaida Lodge). he had received a call from my Father that on the banks of the Rapti river would be a leopard.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is only a few minutes away from the village of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I started with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father had watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river where the Leopard was and I immediately began to crashing pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar aims to cooperate with the authorities to gain international recognition for Neptune and would like to deepen the understanding of the wild animals that wild animals are not as horribly as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know it, because he was faced with tigers from face to face:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger can't be bothered by the opinion of the sheep!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleep time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also I was at home because of the darkness on the way back home, when suddenly the king of the Buster appeared. he immediately starts, we see ourselves and he salute me through the Sal-trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar the logo "I click for Conservation" (lit.: I click for environmental protection) on his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">However, his passion for the advancement of Neptune and Wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days, and lived mostly in a tent in order to make at the Bardia National Park recordings of Ottern. up to 12 days it lasted until he took a tiger photographed and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist income.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This entry was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and originally appeared on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international community organization from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was published here as part of a content sharing Agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, it is to avoid women with the greatest care, the name of her husband or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead they use a pronouns or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh women give women that they should respect the husband because of the social pressure, as well as fear of the consequences, they should respect the norm to maintain this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year Malati Mahatoto was condemned by a hypocrisy and rejected by their family and the village community after having addressed a reunmarried relatives.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of their wives are also not mentioned in the name, is also common among men. however, they have much less right instructions to fear, if at all, they should not occur in this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the district Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health personnel, as well as housewives, a unique club, and were therefore quickly become the main progressive topic of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them to discuss and discuss the intricacies of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states, he is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, which is operated by the Community Video Volunteers and advocates the reduction of Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Pahas worked for seven years with the help of her video camera on the exposure of practices, such as children's heir to the exile of HIV- and AIDS infected, and guides these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">It tells about how these clubs have created a safe place for these women, and they simultaneously made the ambassador of the change at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video, which showed the Rohini in its discussion, acted by women, who did not name her husband's name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this issue because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patriarchate with a problem that women can easily identify with.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Not to address the name of her husband is a bracelet, which they maintain all obligations and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman has respected her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not stop this is considered a backbone as a woman without morals.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition has become so deeply rooted, that we have never made thoughts about this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning was Rohini, who had never called her husband so far, at home on how it works.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband were silent for a long time after the video was at an end.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"" "" "" "Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said, I would like to name it from now on his name." ""</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in luggage, Rohini started its first discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "Patriarchate" never before. some believed that there was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women tried to get the discussion with an exercise.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked any participant to tell the name of her husband with different emotions - happy, upset, sad, affectionate and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then she asked all, "If we cannot tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us how they want, means that they do not respect us?</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equal? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when she brought the name of her husband on her lips," says Rohini Pawas from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra on the Break of a centuries-old tradition, in the married women never speak the name of her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that during the whole exercise, she decided to go just before him; another one decided to move the whole ancestral frustration against him and his family by cursed him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Still in the rush of adrenalin to have broken with an ancient brushing, the women decided that they would actually attempt at home to name her husband's name.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they held their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next days Rohini received a variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband called a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas they put in the head: his wife could not stop his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it at dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law she was starred, she got fear and said that it was an error.</seg>
<seg id="1511">"" "another woman said," "" "Rohini meant to do it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant in was less understandably and the situation deformed in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as the wearing of the zinnoberred dot on the forehead, which indicates the spestatus:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do only women show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband, that I would carry the zinnoberred spot if he also saw it.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I heard it to carry it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not stopped completely, but mine, they are now in a better position to choose to themselves, not to carry it on some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "we do a trip on each discussion." ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "" "" "I don't want the women to ensure that what could hear," "" "says it." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">In recent months they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes; they danced and sang and reported about things they had never thought beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have been talking about some things, for example like our identities to our husbands, never talked so honestly.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to say certain things loud, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round, we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have carried only saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most is that okay, but some wanted a salmon Kurta, a wide shirt about a pants, wear; they have not drunk.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After much dispute and discussion about the merits of their own clothing, the morals combined with the Saris and much more, smed Rohini her own couple of curtas (Oberhemden) into a discussion, so that the women could wear them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next they have decided to plan a trip to Goa where they can carry jeans and Rohini is certain that they will be able to create it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question, whether in the five months since its first discussion club has changed a little, the Rohini confirms that things are slowly coming into roles:</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have only done small steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women probiased it a few times, but then heard back to say the name of her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, included me, do it yet, but only if they are alone and no other family members are involved.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two say the name of her husband: only one or two women now carry zinc on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes that they want to achieve in their lives - like feiling for more freedom of movement or the own closeness - at the end of a hard to navigating river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self confidence, they will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am it too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each one of us confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not just limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes in the club home and other people of it will talk about what we are talking about and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We are all sitting in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1626">A photo of Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia that probably has been made recently.</seg>
<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on July 8, 2017 in Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of detained Chinese dissidents Liu Xiaobo has drawn attention in the international community after his lawyer has been announced at the end of June that he has been sent to hospital due to liver cancer in the final stage.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009 Liu was sentenced to eleven years imprisonment for "Subversion" (state of state), after joining the Charter of the Charter 08, a manifesto which was calling for democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">The State Department in China has referred to Lius case as "an internal matter," and a spokesperson he said it as "not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country."</seg>
<seg id="1633">Nevertheless, China will continue to call up from the international community, the Nobel laureates and his wife, Diers in Liu Xia, allowed to release him a treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others are completely outwiped out.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summarised some reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Pointer Ra-ad al-Hussein, the High Commissar of the United Nations for Human Rights, met at the end of June Chinese officials to discuss the fall of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">A spokesman refused to comment whether the United Nations should exercise pressure in order to allow liu abroad a treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway and Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's prime minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister BÃ¸rge Bring have refused to answer questions about Lius release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway went to Stocks, after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu, although the Norwegian government rushed to do so that this is ultimately nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were continued until December last year. only in June, Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon trip to China since the exports since 2010 were largely blocked.</seg>
<seg id="1643">Once the message had spread that Liu was serious, the Nobel committee brought its hope for a unconditional release to express and lud liu to pick its prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to its adherence, he was not able to counter his prize.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament adopted a decision to liberate Liu and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support where he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The peak diplomats of the EU, Federica Mogherini, demanded China also for the release of Lius on how to take part in an explanation at the 30th of June:</seg>
<seg id="1649">At the same time, we expect China to elevates all restrictions of Mr Lius wife and family members.</seg>

<seg id="1654">"" "the request of the U.S. message attracted an angry answer from China, with the utterance of the State Department that" "" "no country have the right to intervene and unanswered remarks about Chinese internal affairs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley told that China should offer the couple:</seg>
<seg id="1656">Protection and freedom such as freedom of movement and access to the medical care of his choice, which they claim according to the Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations.</seg>

<seg id="1664">On 28 June, the Canadian ambassador John McCallum China called on to provide appropriate medical care and give him the opportunity to worry about his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Lius Anwalt told AFP previously that Lius wife, Liu Xia, who could visit him every day, but the police have always been able to visit the room in the hospital and that it is Liu not permitted with someone outside, including his lawyers, speak and contact.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum tells on:</seg>
<seg id="1667">Canada demands China to liberate its international human rights, including freedom of expression, to preserve and liberate the rights for the exercise of these rights.</seg>

<seg id="1670">All necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo receive all treatments which he, regardless of where, requires. furthermore, his wife and family may have contact to him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news station France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, the State Department announced that there is no further information that France will eventually take him.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan</seg>
<seg id="1673">"" "" "" "the Council of the mainland affairs in Taiwan called on 27 June to release Liu and to demonstrate a greater tolerance to those seeking peaceful means to promote political reforms and democratic development." ""</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Taiwanese Legislative legislators, Yu Mei-nu by the ruling Democratic Progress Party, China also called on to allow the sick intellectual liu to treat themselves in Taiwan.</seg>

<seg id="1676">The spiritual leader in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, showed himself very worried in an explanation on 28 June by Liu and gave that many have asked him to pray for Lius well-being.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my faith that the initiatives he took and for which he was strictly punished, to a harmonious, stabilising and affluous of China, which in turn would have contributed to a peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I felt personally very moved and encouraged, when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens inspired by Liu Xiaobo, the Charter 08 signed, which stands for democracy, freedom and the rule of law in China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid since Singapore is recognized at an international level as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice, K. Shanmugam should be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This observation has triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branches of the State Chamber of New York, the minister noted that many people criticized the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He support Singapore as a city should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... nobody asked whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "the blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice," "" "the logic to ban" "" "to defend the existing authoritarian" "" "power in Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and attachments to create this valuable country, one hear that we will ultimately be no country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the semblance of a flight before the responsibilities, a mandatory infringement.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore if you are not my country, eat country then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons mentioned by Shanmugam were not very noble: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries, given it, he appeared undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In contrast, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently run by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Once you reach the core point of the topic, the good old glue emerges from the authoritarian rulers to pretend Democrats, leaving logic, because it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the final effect, the very last week of Shanmugam gave answers to his American guests with regard to our press, our youth-dictative, our political system really non-responses.</seg>
<seg id="1703">Appropriate questions tarded with non-responses to rational way.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls for Shanmugam to clear his opinion, since they did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country, but a city is, so which country belongs to our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I understand nothing.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the effort to clarify this point unless he was paid for, to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By clicking on the blog he has published his comments on the reviews that you should begin to read the entire co-ordinance of the conference, in order to better understand the context of the statements of Shanmugam, according to which Singapore is a city and no country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcription.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said that Singapore is rather a" "" "city" "" "as a country," "" "he said why the elections in Singapore would be so unimportant, even if we enjoy free and fair elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He lived Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said, Singapore" "" "was not a country," "" "he has obviously not meant to be in this sense." ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, who makes a leader of a growing generation, such a polemic statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am talking about what the Minister of Justice Minister of Singapore has said,...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the Old Guard, what I do - whether I agree with them or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes that he really believes and aware of what he defends.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The Temasek Review defies the weaknesses of Shanmugams Argumenten:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"" "Mr Shanmugam" "" "benchbeliever has committed a mistake" "" "or was it a misleading speaker?" ""</seg>

<seg id="1744">Depending on the situation the conversation takes place, it is considered politely to show interest in his interlocutor by putting personal questions.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In my mind, then the default answer then follows: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, Eishockey, Nature." many Canadians might be inwardly inwardly especially when they are held for Americans but don't disturbs me that.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For anyone who does not know himself, there is little that distinguishes us Canadians from Americans.</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians are well visible on their backpack when travelling.</seg>

<seg id="1898">On the path of migrants that Europe or Latin America cross, certain places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, it is located on the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is led by a 59- year old, a small woman with a corals with corals with corals and gold-colored earrings in TeddybÃ¤ren form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">It is called ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name of Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather they have become a target for Africans and Haitians who are on the journey.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel does not have any charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about 2.50 dollars the night sleep the guests in simple rooms, with cold, crumbling walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - yet there are hundreds of African and haitianic migrants here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Ms. RamÃ­rez, the people come in full small buses and from the upper part of the coast begin to call her: "Mama Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment it is rather quiet but this year RamÃ­rez already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have already slept on the map.</seg>
<seg id="1912">It does not want to reject anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings them to hospital when they are sick, they buy them drugs they may not pay, they massaged them with a balm that exhausted from the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, has recently arrived.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa is a reasonable nickname for Mrs RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The Family Sebastiao (with her daughter Merrui, who has a yoghurry) with ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>

<seg id="1919">"yes, yes," answers with a smile. "I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister who hopes to go to Boston to find her husband and the three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They have already lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on the way to the United States to make normal a first stop in South America and then move towards north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa. "Mama Africa is a well known name on the track," explains Felix Michelet, a Guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells us that the Haitian and the Africans often travel together the way and that Africans are already talking to Whatsapp of Mrs. RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">How many of his Wayshowers, Michelet has lived in Brazil before and worked as construction workers on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the football championship.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy was weaker, he has started his journey into the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money in order to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will contact RamÃ­rez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"" "" "" "Mama Africa is our mother and we never let them go again," "" "he smelly." "" "we will always stay in contact." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1932">Ms. RamÃ­rez told that their guests often send text messages if they have gone to kiss them or to report her about the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">It declares that their Christian faith in the drive of their work is.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She does not know much about Africa, but their guests have brought her to prepare chickens as in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Ms. RamÃ­rez is perhaps very well known here, but it is not the only spark of hope for migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city there is a dead end to JesÃºs of Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">In this winter, Valenzuela and his family have started migrants in her little house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is polzist and found that the bus tickets are sold to numerous African immigrants.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He has begun to help them get a reasonable price, then he has offered them his house for one dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment 25 people are there, mainly Haitian.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleeping on ceilings on the ground, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I lived in the United States," he tells. "I experienced what they experience.</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people can help and others do not help. that's the reason why I give them my support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">After having lived for three years, he was transferred to a raid on his labour market from the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants that travels through Tapachula, comes from Central America, other inhabitants also open the doors of their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">JosÃ© Antonio Cordova MelÃ©ndez told me that he fled to people in Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to press money from him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for an accommodation and a unknown, one allustomed, has offered him their roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later, the family still lives there and they tried to decide where the next steps should go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the courses we consult their phones quietly.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus has arrived today and has 20 new guests, a large part of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Ms. RamÃ­rez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgically, because of those who have gone.</seg>
<seg id="1955">As a proud grandmother she blush her in her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There are one of her daughter with African hair spots that you made a customer in, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and Old.</seg>

<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang inhabitants are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">A check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjang from Twitter users, have given us...</seg>
<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, a ethnic minorities in the west of China, are forced to install a spyware on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10, the mobile users of the Tianshan District of the City of Urumqi received a cell messages in which it indicates the District government to install a surveillance app called Jingwang (or "Web Cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "the communication is said that the app will be entitled to access terrorist information" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">"" "" "" "but kÃ²s the authorities also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism." ""</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture, because they had already installed the app, messages with a private Wechat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the communication of the police force that the app would determine the sources and the distribution paths of terrorists, along with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information" including videos, pictures, ebooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is the blockage of pornographic websites, from online scams, Trojan and phishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online, and to control the own home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with filtering for minors should help the children to develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote" state actors or even hackers could manipulate the home network of a person or to steal it.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is consistent with other measures to control digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While notifications about digital censorship in China mostly focus on the experience of users in larger cities in the east and south, the reality is very often dark for those who live in distant, oppressed ethnic minorities such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">To limit unrest and dissatisfaction in the conflicting areas, the authorities often arrange extreme censors and monitoring measures as well as routinous Internet terminations.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The news based on Twitter-based media outlet "Images from Mainland China" (which was posted by a Checkpoint), showed photos of a checkpoint, at the police officers, subsequently overchecked whether they had installed the surveillance app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian ensure that people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification demanded that the people will install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are detected at a checkpoint using a device without this software, they could be detained up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a return for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have been forced to use the people who are meant for older people to use.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of bondage through rest technology.</seg>

""</seg>
<seg id="1985">After installing Jingwang, computer and mobile phones are used in Xinjiang to electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The provisions in Jingwang are potentially a reaction to the instructions of the city party Council to minimize the dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All governmental entities, authorities and the party connected institutions including universities and research institutions are obligated to follow the instructions of Cybersecurity office when operating their computers and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A current report by Freedom House, a U.S. American human rights organization, mentioned also these new monitoring methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, the authorities published on 27 June in a district of regional capital of Urumqi, a regulation with the statement to all the residents and entrepreneurs, until 1 August their "personal ID cards, phones, external drives, portable disks, notebooks and media cards" to register in local police.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The jordan Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time indoors; sometimes he scourges to his screen, sometimes to his computer, and again to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what you can leave, is a cigarette between his fingers or his with nicotine to discover lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the top floor of his family house, which has been part of them since 1967; in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and Hdaibs family had compelled to escape from their village in Palestine in which they had lived as rocky (about: Farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">"" "" "" "for six years Haib is a passionate activist who faces the conservative majority and asks her native opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapmusic." ""</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, often deals with topics such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, but also calls for the core of the entire Arab world. all these topics do not only find in his hometown Amman relevance, but also in cities that range from Damascus in Syria to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With its 25 years, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not restricted in his mind by borders, and may according to his own statement with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he does not give it openly, he swept up against the American foreign policy a special bow.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his sympathy for those who try to survive in war areas, to do anything with his identity as a "Palestinian winged of second generation," even if he was born in Jordan, and has never been in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"" "" "" "I don't think of my own life circumstances so" "" "stressed Hdaib." ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">Then he adds: "I think so, because I am a man," while in water solstists it in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan. in this time it is intended for Muslims, from sunrise to sunset.</seg>
<seg id="2105">The jordanic law also states that public consumption of food is illegal during the Ramadan.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee on a sensing hot Junitag has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically, the gap of warm coffee and the salient of the Kent cigarette in the nose is first and foremost of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan like a prison feels like a prison in the open sky, especially when looking at a view to neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Of therefore, it is easy to do basic things - as to drink in public during the Ramadan water - to not land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the interior of the Department of Jordanian has canceled a appearance of the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some parliamentarians who support the Islamic Action Front - the jordal branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual side of Hamed sensuo, the cultural and traditional norms of the country contradicts and the main reason for the concert.</seg>
<seg id="2112">"" "the S & D spokeswoman in the Islamic coalition of DIMA Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that had been told the concert" "" "because of the sexual orientation of the slave." ""</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many claim, the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world be more dangerous activism, which represents the old approved legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the entire region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila did the jordal people as "progressive supporter of human rights," which continues to stand for an intellectual and cultural pluralism. "</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement probably might not be just silluous rhetoric but in fact, a more and more clear reality is reflected in Jordan, which occurs in Haibs's work clearly.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016 Hdaib traditional Gender normen to Leibe, trying to portray his vision of the fate of Arabic women who have failed sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of an apparently down-known woman whose arms and legs stretch themselves up to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who really should trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Over the past years, the number of "volunteers" has increased in Jordan - the inofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of volunteers in 2016 reached their peak; however, the institutional infrastructure is lacking in order to support the women, the victims tried murder or domestic violence have become reasonable.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law for breaking down the year 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence, "at undetermined time in prison," and for their release is often a years of bureaucratic effort, as well as the guarantee of the family necessary that the woman has nothing to happen.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaibs Music enjoys great popularity and is known for it, do not shy away from issues that are long as tabu in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib shows that his work is political, however, that he is his music, the full of explicit quotes on sexuality, freedom and expression cannot be separated from politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man.</seg>
<seg id="2125">"" "he was a policy of politics" "", "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2126">"" "in a song called" "" "Edward Sa'ed" "", "Hdaib takes the question of the Palestinian identity." ""</seg>
<seg id="2127">"" "in" "" "Lawla al 3aib" "" "and in" "" "Ghareeb" "" "is the focus on poverty." ""</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of the songs that are politically politically, can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib published a song with the title "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and any other is it too."</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market, on which one can get in his words, "what you want" - be it faith or non-faith, hetero- or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that hardly anyone talks to Jordan on the rights of gay and lesbians and that comments on equality of LGBTQ + individuals were still heavily censored in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014 Hdaib resulted in an interview for the popular jordal OnlineProgramme Roya to remember that his comments were scrapped from the context, and had been censored in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but it was only a processed version," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today Hdaib acquires Hdaib open for the Arab LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance towards homosexuals do not speak to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentioned Abu Nuclear, a poet of the eighth century that has remained in memory even today thanks to its homoerotic poetry.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nuclear that later once on behalf of the caliph should work to write in the eighth century openly about homosexuality, why can Jordanier that not?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemitic kingdom there is nothing new more that the government attack attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the jordal message service took several former government-level and members of the teacher's association, with the reason, they have expressed critically on the comments in social media, which coincided with the deeply rooted in the land of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of what is the concert Hdaib opinion, only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanier.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him, progress is a permanent giving and taking. Jordan has replied Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - it is Hdaib - consists of slow, precious and inner changes. it is certain that these changes take place from day to day at the heart of the jordal society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Ultimately, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, also, from a Arab world without interventions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">"" "he dreaming not only of it, his work until Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of them." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will deal with music, art and literature of genuine and basic openness - and not by bombs, stretching and artificial kind, and at least he hopes that.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until it is far, Hdaib will continue and therefore also resist.</seg>

<seg id="2149">Nebuta is one of the three largest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These large, extravagant warriors are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">We suspected that it is a variant of the Tanabata festival, which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of Tohocus. another theory means that the stronghold, the drums and dancing over more than a thousand years have been handed over to the north-east to force the indigenous people of the region, the Emishi to force into the knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We could make a few great seats, so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">One can only imagine how big these parts are...</seg>

<seg id="2157">I saw myself again the Meguro Gajoen again for a long time: two trolleys are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless it is for many people who take the trip to Aomori to take the Nebuta festival the only truth - and to spend a wonderful way in this summer:</seg>

<seg id="2167">Rarely were outer appearance and body care so important as in this story, as they help preserve the Peruvian youth from the crime and to promote a legitimate profession like those of the hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Perus's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic center of Lima - a region with a very high crime rate, where street rob and illegal drugs are allotted daily.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, appearance and thus also the fancy hairstyles of famous sportsmen like Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Chile), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led to become more and more normalized into the experienced hands of hairdressers that can make these elaborate hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles that go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the competition of the hairdresses of your "Batalla de Barberos," which has been held since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There are experts to join each other to show who can be able to create the most eccentric layout, as you can see in the following video (more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as school Augusto Salazar Bondy, found here in El Callao, found here an opportunity to persuade young people from them to find their weapons against hairdressing tools, and instead of bad ratings to receive a training in hairdressing art that allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the offering opportunities have seen dozens of young people that they can take a profession which is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">The school offered special training workshops before the end of March, and reported on some of their successes:</seg>

<seg id="2181">"" "the following article is the edited version of the" "" "love message" "" "guerrilla warfare" "", "which has published the international online magazine Tea After Twelve." ""</seg>
<seg id="2182">The contribution will be published here in a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write only love for people who we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not yet much more important, people who feel embarrassed with affection?</seg>
<seg id="2185">Exactly this question went to the two young Colombian activists from the foundation of Bogota and Cristian Palacios from the Young-Youth Foundation, no more from the head and inspired it to the campaign Cartas por la ReconciliaciÃ³n (letters to reconciliation) to write young people to write guerrilla warfare.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently, her country's showroom of a historical event and they wanted to contribute to their part: after years of talks, the Colombian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guerrilla FARC (German: revolutionary forces of Kolumba), which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">International was considered the submission of peace agreement as so significant that the Colombian President JosÃ© Manuel Santos was awarded for his merits for the Nobel Peace Prize.</seg>
<seg id="2188">But in front of the Columbians, there is still a long way until you can speak of a real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla warfare that have been living in illegal camps for many years, had been exposed to war rhrhetoric and brought up their weapons around the clock to integrate themselves into life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society in turn, who had accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deeply hatred of guerrilla warfare has now to record them into their ranks and assist them in building a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombian was joined together and would need to help with the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And this is exactly what they did: until now, thousands of young people have written letters - love message to former guerrilla warfare in order to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign are 6900 letters - one for any former guerrilla warfare that should be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the letters of reconciliation arose at the world summit of the Nobel Peace Prize, who took place in BogotÃ¡ in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk to Kailash Satyarthi who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This explained that we love the human who we love, write on Valentine's day thousands of love, but those forgot they need much unnecessary.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plan, he told him to share his love with people this year, the most urgent need.</seg>
<seg id="2198">So the plan was to write letters of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC, who now find their place in society and have to build up a new life. "the letters will show that Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history to a common history of peace," they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Until now, more than 2000 letters have been collected within the framework of the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia like Cali, Manizales, MedellÃ­n, Barranquilla and BogotÃ¡.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought that someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over on 19 March in one of the UN camp in Caldono-Cauca.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students at the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city administration of Cali and Leonardo from the foundation of Bogota travelled to the camp to overtake the letters personally.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC set up as they had done before to counter the precepts of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they received no precepts, but letters of sub-protecting people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for all involved. "it's incredible how many different feelings you can go through just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between," told the political knowledge-student Manuela JimÃ©nez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, an employee of the governor of the province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After we had passed the letters, a former warrior led me through the camp of guerilla-fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cambuches" (a kind of cottage, in which the guerrilla war live) saw I saw a guerrilla warfare that wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to enter, because beside him on the bed there was an MGL-pomegram, a deadly weapon in the thorn-pipe.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "I still spoke it and asked," "" "hello, what do they just?" "" "I answered," "" "I answering a letter that someone wrote to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Never before in my life someone has written a bit so beautiful, so I repented to it. "there I suddenly hit the tears about the cheeks.</seg>
<seg id="2214">I embraced him very firm and set me next to the pomegraners.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was sorry to the war, was sorry to be all the years of faithful companions of this fighters and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never had anything else from life expectedly than war. he had never imagined the FARC, was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers before the hunger strike. "I never thought someone would be forgiven me for my fault.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society out there that waits with open arms for us.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now I learned just how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"" "but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">For prelude, students and some leaders of the FARC came together to a discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as war and the FARC already acted in hiding.</seg>
<seg id="2223">That is why the leaders of the FARC, the history of the organization, their ideals, and gave insights into their views on the peace process: "many years have experienced how social injustice we have the opportunity to develop into a political party, we can help to make the society more equitable.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "" "" "for a purpose of this scale, it is worth to overcome all obstacles," "" "said one of them." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">To hear these people who had never heard heard and had no choice right now, and to realize that people who have often seen as a monster and even hate, even people with beautiful feelings were converted by their living conditions and their environment was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the land lives, does me hurt.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforted me that all men - also those who have killed and so much damage caused us to teach us something and give a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo GonzÃ¡lez, the commandant of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, for example DarÃ­o de JesÃºs Monsalve, the Archbishop of the city of Cali, the following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombian was prophesied, that after the disarmament peace would rule.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities there will always be people who are prepared to take up arms and to protest to their rights. and that is also completely justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We of the FARC are now putting on peace, to a policy without arms.</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call all defenders of peace - no matter which race, religion or ideology they listen - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and bringing sacrifices, as we know from our own experience, that nothing is simply. those among us who defend life as the basis of existence will become many difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2251">Already since her childhood she sensed that she was a woman in reality.</seg>
<seg id="2252">When she grew up, you become aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for them, why she moved to Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="2253">After a group of Chechnyan was experienced by the gender equality of their landlady, hunting was opened on Sabrina.</seg>
<seg id="2254">Fear for her life she moved to the United States in the end.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I was active as a volunteer helper in a human rights organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day was told me that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">It was a friend of Dagestan, a transine that tasted in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2258">She had no money, so I took her without hesitation.</seg>
<seg id="2259">While I tried to help her, he made a friend, a copy of my documents and spread it all over the internet, with my telephone number and a picture of me. he sent them to his tschethenian friends, with the following message: "then there are no men more in Chechnya that can remove these shame?"</seg>
<seg id="2260">After that, the photos made by my documents from the whole WhatsApp took the round.</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015 I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">"" "when I was straight, a few shopping pieces from the backseat of my car, I heard one of men's voice:" "" "here is a gift for you from your uncle." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned out, I felt anything in my body, but I did nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2264">"" "then I heard a sentence, but this time on twitchastic:" "" "how long do you still want to honor the family, you scandfleck?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I just know that it was a young man, no 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and woke up in the hospital again.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently, some women had got everything and started scream.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital I learned that I had two stitches in my right lung poultry.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which nurse you were placed - in which men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are outdated, there is still my male name dron; but the doctor stood and put me to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very grateful for this.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time in his office, I got it with the fear; it was a Muslim, a caseless name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him that he respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than one month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">In the last February I got threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">This was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was attended by neighbours and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The demanded to send me back to Chechnya to prove that everything was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They asked absurd demands: some said to me, I must prove it by going up without through the roads; others wanted that I had not changed on the official television in Grosny, and say that I was not subject to my gender, that everything was only bad speech, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grains size C - what would I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it is still hard for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older people once talked to my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">They said to her, "They have brought a monster to the world that not only your family, but the whole republic is ashamed.</seg>
<seg id="2290">We can not stir you because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here. "</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother became too much and she put a strike around the neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved into an apartment and a few hours later, under the window was a car with darkened windows and a number plate with a 95 dron.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Once it happened for the third time, I became clear that there was a little lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human right friend audited the numbers plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you fly?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons, I do not want to give up their names, but I will say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With her help I left the country, but then something is believed.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before leaving from Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought them without register without notice, without notice, without everything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and cast it into the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Came and checked to the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">In the moment when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message: "you don't think about, you will be in security, just because you have left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know in which hotel you do. they even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">"" "just to prove" "" "s to prove to you: it is the number 115." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">However, we do not talk about gender equality. however, this is a taboo topic.</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditionally casautic elements I still traded in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">So much I also wish, this emotional barrier can I not overcome.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that, as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to hurt them.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera, I will give me trouble as to watch the person out of their past - so in my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends, those who have stayed dorms?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I have submitted a report to Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For whom I needed current information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I spoke to someone who has sent one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that during the Ramadan were no people arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he didn't manage a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">So I mean, they probably invite the relatives, these are concerned about the problem with the affected person and in the end require a proof that the so-called "honor" through blood satisfaction has experienced.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are now still gay men in these secrecy?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says, there were not very many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, then especially those who have no rich relatives, or who were dropped from their relatives to place Kadyrows court.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are held there so that one can present them later as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Say: should they be inverted, they will show their bodies on TV and claim that they could have attacked any village or a military base.</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"" "" "" "as if these people were not simply vanished, but specifically submerged to radialize itself." ""</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is that now only a mutation or do you have a source of this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was detained one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard has grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There have been nothing new since then.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They have it easy to join.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was self-evident than these people were taken away.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now they were not presented as a bandits, there were so far no reports. we suppose that such actions are quite possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else could it not allow this man to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and kidnapping of people who listen to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation, have already been held in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always carried my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya, I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think before 2003 I was already familiar with a great number, when I lived there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In the Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999 when the Sharia was considered, I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">"" "" "" "Russia was originally to introduce ourselves to the" "" "civil isation" "", "but ultimately, we finally discarded back to the stone-time." ""</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were traded; I had dyed eyelashes, carried the tube and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The security of the sharia has never absorbed me only a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In front of the Russian theatre in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people met as I met.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several benches were standing, and all the city knew about them; they knew why men, young people, there met.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a phrase: Kharda ma Kharda. that is: "Spotto is not about the unhappiness of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">It is often said to children, when they are talking about sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they just have their eyes closed before you because they believed you are sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They have never coded me, never hunted and never beaten.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long stopped this time of grace?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrow stood on the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister for Prime Minister he began to speak on TV about morality.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He did not speak about us per se, but primarily on the behavior of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could feel how the people caught in the city to change.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Who previously smiles and yellow, considered that at one time with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I got back home I could feel how the situation in the Republic has steadily deteriorated.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you proceed now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I do not receive a lot - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the US is not much.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I am still working as a activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of Psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organize teacups, groupings, I begining them to hospital and helping them to get fences.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I have no cents for this.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself when I stumbled away.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslim and would like to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: enter an Hiddenab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: this is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So nature, that has purely nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Tschetschenen, who want to white you with foam in front of the mouth that there are no coils with them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">"" "the Dagestan have those who have the Kabardines which, the Russians also have them: but on the whole planet there are - but" "" "not in Chechnya." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2386">I am from there, that is why it is unpleasant for me to hear so what to hear.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet here as many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go into the mosque and fasten during the Ramadan - live with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">Do you know how many think in transitioning to men who love men, and they believe that you will change his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that is a truce.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different types of sensation in order to be exactly, different life settings.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin and do not be ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry to be here personally, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not sad at all. I just know that I am now myself.</seg>

<seg id="2411">The region where most of the Arabic Ahwazi community living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult for the native Arab population to ride their livelihoods.</seg>
<seg id="2412">In a century ago, the Arabic Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi Monarchy took over power and undertook the 1925 large efforts to end the ethnic autonomy in Iran.</seg>

<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments under the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I am not a feminist, many women react - especially white women who call themselves as intersectional feminists - with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put well thought scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be feminist and why we generally should be all feminist * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, women still earn less money despite equal education than men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation, when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their body.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women come sooner or later in various fields of life to a glass blanket, and that discrimination based on sex still moves across the many different countries and beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I am double and triple among them.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet, when I speak on skin colour, on racism, on black CIS women, on black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women from the Diaspora; when I mention, on which way we have always been physically, psychological and verbal movement, many white feminists and white intersectional feminists are to be silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">"" "however, everyone agree that women - all women - should come together to lift" their voices and "" "" Kumbaya "" "," my Lord "" "" to achieve equality (some) of women. "" "</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don't want to talk about that it is in addition to sexualised violence a institutionalised form of racist violence that we are exposed black women in two fold ways.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnicities and countries of origin earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girl and girls are referenced with a migration background of school than white girls, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black spheres and women are exposed to a higher risk to suffer domestic violence and violence in partnership, as white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I will say that all men, all men and all of all humans have the same rights; on the other hand, I can not join me as a black woman, in whose centre the white woman stands, which refuse to take into account injustices in their mind, which refer to both the gender and the skin colour of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affiliation in a white-feminist pledge that has always rejected me and countless other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"" "Soekner defendant 1851 in her speech:" "" "am I not a woman?" "" "I am not a woman?" "" "and I refuse to maintain a ideology, in which the black woman in historical ways is a dehumanised and marginalized nature." ""</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join me groupings, which also absorbing our customs and customs to drive their egocentric programme.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to put white women the importance of trimmer of skin colour and gender. for some of them will continue to mention the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to honor them one better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although the intersectional feminism was founded to give women of different arrivals and boundaries themselves from the white feminism, is still the word "feminism" in his name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to get rid of myself completely and completely by the feminism and called me the movement of the Womanism, which was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman, rather insistent that interseduction is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever before we define black women in our own ideas and embarked us into the spheres, which are created by us for us.</seg>

<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists immediately call separatism and exclusion after they read these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement, by which the black woman is concerned.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a bluristic environment, I can lift black women and women of other cultures, because in this paradigm I exist.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I will be recognized as part of this paradigm due to my dark skin and because of my existence.</seg>

<seg id="2490">It is difficult to determine how many women are really misdiagnosed, says Myrian GonzÃ¡lez, researcher at the Centro de DocumentaciÃ³n y Estudios, a social-scientific research institution in Paraguay. "there are various statements and reports that will not even raise the extent of gender-specific violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2491">The available figures are however alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, at the District State Bar 9600 ads went on account of domestic violence. at 70% of it, it was about violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 ads due to domestic violence in the peace process. also here 86% of the ads came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the ads, 40% of women said they were physically misdiagnosed, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">These statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the paraguayischen Frauenministerin Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually displayed. "on any woman who are not reimbursed in Paraguay because of psychic misconception, 9 women who do not do this.</seg>
<seg id="2498">On any woman who are reimbursed because of physical distracts, two women, who do not do this, "stated them at the end of 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since women's murder in Paraguay have no own criminal law, the prosecution authorities can not be adequately documented how many women were murdered by their current or former partners every year.</seg>
<seg id="2500">Until August 2016, journalists were at least 12 cases of feminism in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator for human rights in Paraguay is at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to their estimates, in Paraguay every ten days dies a woman due to violence by men.</seg>

<seg id="2505">Before Mariana BrÃ­tez the firm friend of Carlos Vera was insisted that she called his name to him all of her former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In the beginning they didn't want this, but then after. this should repent them forever.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos together. but two years she bore the mental violence against women - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time recognizing the most severely recognizable:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought that I would become victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">If I read about it earlier, I always thought that that only women's happening to dismiss the ones because they let themselves be deceived by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that I would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana uses social media to report about the misraging through Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without name, she wrote posts on Facebook, where they described his insults and various attacks during their two-year relationship and told how he had isolated them.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically, whether he ever raised the hand against them, and refused to confess that his behaviour was also a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why they had fallen for such a long time by Carlos and did not leave him earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as they wanted to say that victims of misconduct would have at least a certain complicity to it.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos that does not come from Paraguay, fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner was mischipped.</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the network Yo te CREO ("I think") that consists of women, which are all victims of misconduct.</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case everything started with psychic mixing.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Their affluent partner eventually managed to persuade them that it was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat her.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victorias displays at the authorities without a result and also from its relatives, she received no support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">It led a process against her former partner who developed into an unsposiable legal struggle between Paraguay and their home country, in which it was mainly about money, power and influence of their former partner.</seg>

<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the movement # NiunaMenos (# non-One) are part of a campaign on Twitter which is supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original draft of the law considers that Femizid was to explain and defierced to an independent criminal law, as it is already in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">So the Legislative text was changed in some points to also win the MPs for the law so that the way for decriminalisation of abortions will be banned, which is currently prohibited in Paraguay and can be punished with up to five years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original bill introduced, most of the (bureaucratic and economic) procedural costs that have to bear the victims of violence currently, if they just want to report and receive a safe accommodation to set up the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argued that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient financial resources for it:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay is distracted as part of human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Here, a rethinking must take place so that violence is no longer considered a little Normal.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Whoever tacklates this facts make himself guilty and contributes to the fact that the perpetrators will get straightened out.</seg>
<seg id="2538">We have to refund such a long ad until distraction is no longer considered normal.</seg>
<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the law was adopted in the paraguayischen Senate. previously, parts of the law had been changed. yet, among other things, a passage was painted, which called the partners in cases of domestic violence for reconciliation.</seg>

<seg id="2563">On 26 September 2016, the first negotiations took place in the trial against Al-Maamari, Al-Haj and Al-Abri.</seg>
<seg id="2564">The Court condemned the three journalists to prison and ordained the final closure of the newspaper.</seg>

<seg id="2568">Al-Abri was sentenced to a year in prison and an money in the amount of 1000 Rial (2600 US dollar), after having the use of "a information network for the dissemination of material that could pose a danger to public order."</seg>
<seg id="2569">For Al-Abri, a deposit was fixed at the amount of 5000 omanic rial (13 000 US dollars) and was released on 22 August 2016 prior to the judgment.</seg>

<seg id="2589">For the need on site medical research there are two reasons: for a lack of global health system many medicines and vaccines that cover the special medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria in the poorest countries of Africa have far more grave effects than elsewhere, and lack of investment for the exploration of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies are a big problem.</seg>

<seg id="2629">Frank Morton have been bred in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">His company offers 114 varieties, such as Outreddish, the first plant cultivated by NASA astronauts in Space and consumed.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Almost 20 years Morton's work was done only by his own objection and the question how many salateries he can get, limits.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000s, he remarked that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use them for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents are not only used for individual varieties, but also for specific properties such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green or green leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">In recent years, more and more of these patents have been filed in more and more plants like grain or cardboard boxes. due to these trends, plant breeders, environmental protection and atomic facts ensure food security for the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia old tradition, Morton still smells, he needs to be longer since his work is becoming more and more difficult due to limitations.</seg>

<seg id="2637">"" "so we have to do that now, but it is a break with the breeding-tradition" "", "he says." "" "I think these patents go to Salads." ""</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand before judgment, no one can breed more of a new salads, because all the characteristics are already patented. "he thus makes as good as possible and tried to breed those features that he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, however, it is very careful and strives to use no material that is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the US and everywhere in the world: open Source Breeding ("Open Source").</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International spacecraft ISS red Roman salads in the "greenhouses" of the station bred and eaten, there will be tested whether plants are cultivated in space.</seg>

<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like it would come from the IT area and not from the plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for "open-Source" seed) is inspired by the movement for free "open Source" software that provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was called into being in order to ensure that some plant species and gene are not protected as intellectual property and permanently available for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">Within the framework of the initiative, just Ossi, the U.S. breeder can commit to us that others can use seeds from them freely.</seg>
<seg id="2647">This does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and they can sell their seeds. "open source" breeders only permit others who breed their seeds, to breed it in order to breed so own varieties, and it is not immediately abees - two aspects which are banned or prescribed by many plant-plants.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its start in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the emerious professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi-Vormembers Jack Kloppenburg are control of the seed and the opportunity to breed new plants, both important for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter or only little to exploit seeds with natural resilience.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg stresses that the "open-source" movement does not work with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not, from ecological agriculture or not. "who wants to buy good, locally and sustainable producing vegetables, as it is offered at farm markets, should also know that the way it is bred on how this vegetables is bred.</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "food addictions without seed is not possible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative commit to others their seed continues to be free of charge. thus, their action in contrast is to patent seed and plant characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo of Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supplies is jeopardised because the available pool is due to the increasingly diverse intellectual property rights on plant material, which thus has always been reduced, unconditionally shrinking.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, Executive director of the Ossi, has engaged in their doctoral thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. it found out that about a third of all cartography characteristics is protected as intellectual property, thus it is suitable for plant breeders either at all or only available.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants there are such estimates not yet, but experts such as Luby suppose that massaging plants such as wheat in even bigger style are patented than salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants will be so bred that they have targeted features - from those in which their taste or colour improves up to such, due to which they prosper in certain environments and threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties point out that the available plant material for breeder caused by more and more patents. genetic diversity is currently constrained than ever since the changed conditions are much worse due to climate change much worse.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail Monsanto-Specherin Carly Scaduto that genetic diversity is generally important and also decisive for monetos activities. with a total of four banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Economic Affairs of the United States, the company is committed to maintaining the genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">"" "however, it contradicts that intellectual property supports other breeders, because" "" "patents and the protection of plant varietfed innovations." "" "a patent is basically taken a plan that everyone can follow once the patent has expired." ""</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others with another method to get to the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Such protection does not inhibit innovations, but promotes them by providing more material and know-how to the public. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees the other: 20 years to wait for a patent reading, is certainly not innovations.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you need to wait for a long time, to breed plants that have been adapted to the changed environmental conditions, one would have lost the battle already.</seg>
<seg id="2669">But the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a general public and continue to remain: "independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such formalities, and monetaires are not attractive to us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">This is what drives us, and it will make us impossible if we cannot continue to use the best and latest genetic resources. "</seg>
<seg id="2672">Overall, Morton is bothering to patent on the concept of itself, plant features: "we do not create the characteristics really itself.</seg>
<seg id="2673">They make up the plants themselves and as breeder we finally had no idea how the plants do that.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeder in the U.S. state Oregon and Ossi, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "who bred a variety, also bred its own values in it.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believes in industrial agriculture with large courtyards and monocultures, for whose cultivation it needs herbicide, bred in its varieties of this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is accurate. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (such, which are on international markets, but smaller than Monsanto are patents, they create most smaller seed companies, even without patents - either they reject this patent or they do it for too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case.</seg>

<seg id="2721">"" "" "" "still the Egyptian authorities" "" "content on the Internet." ""</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a columnists.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend around the 05.August, the Egyptian government continued the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported above selfers.</seg>
<seg id="2724">"" "August, the network published an opinion on Facebook, in which it sharply criticized the Egyptian authorities for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region." ""</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information Appeal - despite this attack and the mockling of Egyptian law and the constitution to defend oneself in this part of the world, it was never as important as now. ANHRI acknowledges that all technical possibilities have been exhausted to overcome the blockage and not to imitate. we insist on our task to fulfill our task.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered to be the first censored website of a human rights organization in Egypt, after the authorities blocked more than two months 21 web pages, as e.g. the independent news page MADA Masr, Arabic-speaking edition of the Huffington Post, and that out of Qatar stammering network of Al Jazeera because of the more congenital support of terrorism.

<seg id="2728">In addition to ANHRI in addition to ANHRI's blog, Ahmed Gamal Ziada has no access to Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada used his blog for the spread of columnists and articles which he does not write in Egypt with public websites and media.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog, which he was directed to handle the censer apparatus of the Egyptian government, even the aim of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider of which also is heated in the blog is also accessible, on the other hand, it is further accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photographer, spent nearly 500 days in captivity, after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces during December 2013, while he reported about the Studentenwerk and a video, how the police exercise physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His article revolve mainly about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada expressed by the government and reflected what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The blogs to lock is very old, however, has priority in the era of Abdelfatal tah al-Sisi. and even if the blockage of blogs may not be significant for the world, it is however it for two reasons for me:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It has succeeded to impart me the feeling of an insulating state; an arrest, a attempted murder, anticipation of the National Security Council, blocking blogs as well as any other website for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proven that I was not in vain. in other words, my words have an influence, even if only on a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First I used it to post items to handle the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">But now, after they have blocked him and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The mugs go the way up to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (AFTE) of Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06. August 133 websites. this took place technical tests in the networks of different Internet Service Provider (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">AFTE also documented the blockage from suppliers, through the transformation of boarding facilities and private surfing, so called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in its research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12, we noticed how the blockage of websites that VPNs offer.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such a practice indicates the intention of blocking the government to block and filter content to the Egyptian users.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The situation will additionally be wormmed that the Censory decisions are taken behind closed doors, thus the Egyptian population has no legal basis, which they can proceed in court against these actions.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with censorship and whom will they attack next attack?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants argue.</seg>

<seg id="2761">The motives for their decision explained the newspaper so:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in any big city in the world like murder, robbery, sex interrupt, etc. all, which happens from civilized standard and what happens only in Rio, will be in the section "War in Rio." (...) This is our way to call: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not include our eyes before the cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video that was shared on Facebook, OctÃ¡vio Guedes, the editor of the newspaper, that this decision is not an occasion for pride, but rather a sign of failure.</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war of war in a country that does not recognise the war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist of the newspaper explained that there are according to indications of the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 843 areas which are controlled by criminal organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial department the newspaper writes:</seg>
<seg id="2768">Us is aware that a war discourse when it is distorted, even if it can be used, atrocities of the police, who only shoots and then ask questions to tucked.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose aim is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Is the name "War" more than it protects?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil argues the journalist CecÃ­lia Oliveira against it to call violence as "war." this is their opinion a justification of the failed security policy through the media and could make it difficult to account for the police account.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and bad planning - as extra in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel, education, and a historical and self-counterfeiting of public service.</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the following civil war, many Syrian cities are suffering from brutal siege and blockages, mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to victories Watch, a joint initiative of the peace organization Pax and the Forschungsinstitut The Syria Institute, are located in Damascus and Umland, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib currently around a million Syrians in a state of siege.</seg>
<seg id="2804">Especially strongly affected is the region East Ghouta, where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013, the lives of hundreds of civilians called for.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organizations and the Syrian opposition go out, based on studies of the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre of Assad regime has been practised.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, these have been controlled by rebels outside of Damascus under siege which led residents to rely on local or through tunnels and control points.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Due to the long blockade, traditional foods such as meat has become unattainable for large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">In return, a group of Syrian humanitarian aid and academics teaches the inhabitants of East Ghoutas, as they can plant their own mushrooms as a "life-saving food source."</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alnida and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Mushrooms do not belong to the conventional ones, in Syria and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine. however, they do not make an attractive nutritional source for many inhabitants of the besieged East Ghouta.</seg>

<seg id="2873">In a night in the autumn of 1994 the conquest of Afghanistan began through the Taliban.</seg>
<seg id="2874">Two years ago, a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mujahedin groupings which had conquered the short-term pro-Soviet government. thus, Afghanistan has become a country of terror and despair.</seg>
<seg id="2875">Right at that time Asharaf Barati, a 13-year-old boy, who belongs to the ethnic group of Hazara in the province of Ghazni in Central afghanistan, for the last time with his family at dinner.</seg>
<seg id="2876">Even if his mother did not say it at that time, she knew that she would not see her son a very long time - maybe even more.</seg>
<seg id="2877">In dawn the boy should set up.</seg>
<seg id="2878">His uncle would pick him up and bring him to the mugglers.</seg>

<seg id="2884">Abdul Ali Mazari, the leader of Hazara domed party hzb-Wahah had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Hazara suddenly felt vulnerable.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban opened for their hatred of Hazara and ever closer.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara provoked the country towards Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">Some days after his escape, Asharaf found himself in Pakistan again.</seg>
<seg id="2888">He worked for a couple of years in a coherence. the work was heavy and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of his low wages, and went to Iran. once again, he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and towed sacks with mortar who were heavier than he himself, in order to earn their livelihoods.</seg>
<seg id="2890">At that time, life of Afghan refugees in Iran was characterized by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really tough," reminded Asharaf in an interview with Global Voices. "we (afghan refugees) lived in a leakesstanding building on the jobsite, on which we worked.</seg>
<seg id="2892">There was no services there and no heating. we hung nylon in front of the open windows so that we do not invaders at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years Asharaf left his life without papers in Iran and made ready for the trip to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous crossing on the sea, he suffered shipwreck and stranger on a small, uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected its asylum entry, Azzaf 2002 came to Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time had homeless homeless, ran alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church who distributed twice a day of food to needy.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that Italy is due to relatively high loading quotas a kind of second chance for expired asylum seekers. it is also true that the conditions that asylum seekers in the country are catastrophic.</seg>
<seg id="2898">The civil rights organization Civil War Union for Europe writes, the system is suffering from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">"" "the vast majority of the asylum seekers will be accommodated in the more than 3000" "" "special reception centres" "". "this is an improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unprepared staff." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to Italian law, asylum seekers can only be assigned to an entrance center, if they have officially placed a request for asylum - what can occur after the registration of the asylum application.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who have no money for accommodation, either reliant on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So there is also Ashark.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his unboundless way of life helped Ashark to release themselves out of these conditions soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After having made several years different work in the construction industry, Ashark tasted its entire savings in the establishment of a hostel in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This was so good that after a while he opened a second hostel and a snorkel.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharaf Baratis success story is now subject of the documentation "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind Venetian luxury - a Hazara in Italy") of the director Amin Wahidi.</seg>
<seg id="2907">The film received the Venice City Award, which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Lots of bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to inofficial estimates, approximately 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years some of the Afghans company emerged, including tailors, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Hamed Ahmadi had the idea to his restaurant Orient Experience in which the waiter and the chef had mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu's menu is told by the various afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek dishes the history of their trip to Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2919">The Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened in Padua the restaurant Peace & amp; Spice and also behind the Pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a Sushi restaurant in Rome are also called Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">However, Asharafs objectives reach far beyond the Italian food trade and the retail outlets and aim back to the country which he had to leave a teenager as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"" "" "" "where a risk is, are also possibilities," "" "says Ashark with a smile." "" "I want to invest in Afghanistan." ""</seg>
<seg id="2922">I never forget my country and I can not live happily if I know that my people suffers.</seg>
<seg id="2923">I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country, especially for women.</seg>
<seg id="2924">They represent the half of society and have to get the same possibilities as any other. "</seg>
<seg id="2925">Asharpenny also forged plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul where people can learn packaging and consistency techniques. "in this way, they can sell their harvest on the market and improve their financial situation," says he.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The development of successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubts, but in the end there are stability and prosperity.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Asharaf has made this journey itself. now he wants to also help other Afghans on this path.</seg>
