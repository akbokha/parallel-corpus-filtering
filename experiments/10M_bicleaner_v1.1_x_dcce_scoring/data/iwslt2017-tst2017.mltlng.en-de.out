this is James R@@ isen .
you may know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times Re@@ porter .
long before anyone had heard of Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book in which he is spectacular that the NSA have illeg@@ ally listened to the phones of Americans .
but it is another chapter that should leave a permanent impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation in which the CIA gave literally dra@@ fts for an atomic bom@@ b .
if the crazy sounds , read it .
it is an incredible history .
but do you know who the chapter did not fall at all ?
the US government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; almost 10 years the government has been determined against ra@@ isen and urged him to call his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; public sources &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this move he became a symbol of the pattern of government , whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers to condemn and to defeat journalists .
according to the first constitutional referendum , the media has the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right if media cannot get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the mud that they will give .
so as the government in R@@ isen , he did something , what many coura@@ geous re@@ porter had already done before him : he refused and said that he would prefer to go to prison .
from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen lived with the risk to go to prison .
but then , just days before the process , something extraordinary .
suddenly , even though they have been granted for years , that it would be imperative in their case , the demands of the government were dropped off .
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring , re@@ porter and sources can always hide less .
rather than to fail and bring forward @-@ ups to the statements , you could also carry out his digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators shall be concerned without his consent , his telephone calls secret ,
just like his e @-@ mail data , financial and banking information , its credit return , and even travel reports with the list of its flights .
in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and ris@@ ens supposed source .
unfortunately , this is just one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect Whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , but instead the judiciary has more condem@@ ns us than all U.S. governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government is too much from their work as ge@@ heim .
since September 11 almost every article on national security was the result of that a whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers went to a journalist .
so we put the press coverage into the game that should be protected by the first Constitutional Court , because the government has always more possibilities to do all .
but just as technology has allowed the government to handle the rights of re@@ por@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources .
and indeed , they can do that from the moment they get in touch rather than in retro@@ spect , in the testimony of the testimony .
today , there is communication software that has not yet been written as a R@@ isen book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls .
a such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source transmission system for whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , which was originally developed by the internet @-@ famous , which was developed by us against Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation in which I have been working .
instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news site , just like the Washington Post .
you can upload or send information to documents , as with any ordinary contact form .
this will then be encrypted and stored on a server , to which only the respective message agency has access .
so the government cannot obtain any more information secre@@ tly , and many of the information they would ask would be available from the outset .
Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect press freedom in the 21st century .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new sp@@ y technologies that end@@ anger us all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is to us to ensure that not only technology in@@ ator such as Edward Snow@@ den have a way to give mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers ,
those who want to report more ab@@ norm@@ alities in the care of soldiers . or the next environmental workers who suggests the alarm for sigh@@ ted water from F@@ lin@@ t . or a Wall@@ street @-@ Insi@@ der that war@@ ns us before the next financial crisis .
after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights .
thanks .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 , the largest data le@@ ak of history was published . &#93; &#91; we b@@ aten Robert Pal@@ mer from Global W@@ itness on a declaration . &#93; This week we were told by news about a L@@ eck of 11 million documents of the law firm Mos@@ sh@@ on in Panama . &#93;
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax hav@@ ens .
we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers have to companies such as mos@@ bag Fon@@ se@@ ca and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up ? &quot;
we actually see the e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages as the whole system works as it works .
this has already resulted in the first very direct consequences .
Iceland Prime Minister is res@@ igned .
also , there are reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator B@@ Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad mailbox in tax hav@@ ens .
it is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russia President Vladimir Putin leads to over a tight friend of children &apos;s days , a famous Cel@@ lists .
now there will be a lot of rich people and others who wait for the next release , and to the next unveil@@ ed documents .
now that sounds like the P@@ lot of an agent or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham @-@ novel .
it seems to cri@@ es from you , ordinary people .
why should us see what happened ?
but the truth is , if the rich and mighty men are able to hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens and not all of their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and this affects all of us .
for my organization , Global W@@ itness , these revelations are phenomenal .
in the whole world , media and leading politicians , such as secret tax hav@@ ens are used by some few to hide their assets and conce@@ aled their assets -- something that we have been discussing and revealing ourselves for ten years .
I think many people will appear this whole world very confusing , and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax hav@@ ens work .
I always imagine it like a mat@@ r@@ jo@@ vice @-@ chapel .
so one has a firm in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these prayers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be very difficult for criminal enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what is happening . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I find it interesting that in the US there are fewer reports on this matter .
pres@@ um@@ ably because there were so far no prominent Americans who came in these revelations , this sc@@ andal .
now it is not so that there are no wealthy Americans to hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens .
however , by the principle of which this tax hav@@ ens function , mos@@ bag Fon@@ se@@ ca has less American customers .
if we had a backup of the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA .
in fact , it is so that in some US states it needs less information to provide less information to establish a company than to get a libr@@ card .
this kind of in@@ transparent in the US has allowed employees from school districts to gam@@ ble school children .
it also permits sc@@ amm@@ ers to ab@@ stain from special investors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects all of us .
here at Global W@@ itness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does that actually work ?
so we sent an un@@ covered investig@@ ator at the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator gave himself as African minister , who wanted to bring suspected money to the USA to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
we really sho@@ cked it that all went up to an Adv@@ oc@@ ate of our investig@@ ators , how he could transfer his money .
these were all occur@@ ren@@ ces . none of these lawyers took us as clients and of course no money was handed over to anyone . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important to consider this not as a single case .
it is not about a single lawyer , which made our un@@ covered investig@@ ator suggestions .
it is not about a single leading polic@@ y@@ makers , wrapped in a sc@@ andal .
it is about how the system works , established by the corruption , tax evasion , poverty and instability .
and to cope with this , we must change the rules .
we have to change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult .
this may sound very nasty as if we could do nothing about it ; as if nothing could have changed , as if it is always the rich and powerful ones .
but as a sal@@ uted optim@@ ist , I see that some things have begun to change .
over the past few years we have witnessed more transparency , what the owners of companies are concerned .
the subject took political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G8 Summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
since then , the EU is recorded in central regi@@ sters at the national level who really lies behind firms in Europe and who controls them .
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lag@@ ging behind .
representatives of both parties have introduced a legislative draft in both parliam@@ ent@@ arians , but this does not make the progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how these Panama revelations , this huge insight into the world of tax hav@@ ens , used as a means to ensure more transparency in the US and globally .
for us at Global W@@ itness this is a moment for changes .
we need ordinary people who are angry if they see how other people can hide their true identity behind proj@@ ectors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need executives in the economy that arise and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ transparent is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognise the problem and use it to end this kind of transparency through laws . &quot; &quot; &quot;
together we can finish the in@@ transparent , which now makes this kind of tax evasion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing , finally end .
this is the story , as I was almost kidn@@ apped and in the trunk of a red Maz@@ ow@@ y it would be .
a day after I finished my design study , I made a back@@ ho@@ f@@ ale .
a guy in the Red Maz@@ da remained and looked like my stuff .
he bought one of my works .
he was alone in the city and just took a road trip through the whole country . afterwards he would go to the peac@@ cor@@ ps .
I invited him into a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where do you sleep today ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not know yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I thought : &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the peac@@ em@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really is planning this . I will not kidn@@ apped in the trunk of a grain that land .
this is a small trunk @-@ room !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard myself : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have a air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bet@@ ter , how please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at night I was then in bed , I deeply moved to the ceiling and thought : &quot; Oh husband ! what have I ro@@ cked myself down ?
a wild alien in my living room .
what if he is crazy ? &quot;
I got such fear that I got out of bed , on ten points on the door , and my bedroom door closed .
but he was not crazy .
we are still in contact .
the artwork he had bought from me today is in his class@@ rooms . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my view .
perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood as stran@@ gers , actually friends , who were only waiting to be discovered ?
people on my balloon , was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress .
let &apos;s take a while , two years later ...
I am unemployed , almost bank@@ rupt , my fellow @-@ inhabitants draws from and the rent is increased .
I learned that there was a design conference in the city at that time . all the hotels were fully booked .
I believe creativity can do it to transform fear into fun .
I wrote my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I survived how we could earn something about it . our apartment will accommodate a designer Bed and Breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk , including a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a site and founded so &apos; air@@ mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; AI@@ R@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air@@ mat on wooden floors .
they found it great , and we too .
I am sure our cheese @-@ ham o@@ mel@@ t@@ ettes was completely different because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them through the whole city . when we passed our last guest and the door to the castle fell , star@@ ed Brian and me .
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
the things came into roles .
my former co @-@ inhabitants , N@@ ates Ble@@ char@@ czyk , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out whether one could make it a business concept .
so we presented our investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people publicly post images of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of room , whose doors you are closed when visiting .
over the internet you can join wild people to stay with them .
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited , that the rocket would ign@@ ite .
but indeed they do not .
nobody who is still completely at Tro@@ st , would invest in a business , the stran@@ gers allowed to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because we as children all have learned that stran@@ gers are dangerous .
if you have a problem , you said to things that you can do well . we could des@@ ig@@ ail .
at the Kunst@@ akademie we learned that design is much more than just looks and hap@@ tics -- it is the overall experience .
we had learned how to des@@ ig@@ nt objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust through design , between people who have never met before .
can design afford as something ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a sample , which degree confidence we asp@@ ed .
it is a 30 @-@ seconds experiment . it will force you out of your comfort .
thum@@ bs up if you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I would like to un@@ lock your mobile phone .
give your un@@ lock mobile phone to your left seat .
this silent approach of panic that you can now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door the first time .
for the only thing is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your text , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to keep the un@@ disturbed cell of a stran@@ ger in your hands ?
most feel the responsibility .
so most of the guests feel even if they stay elsewhere .
only for this reason can our company exist .
only once , who has now actually Al Gor@@ es mobile ?
could you announce on Twitter that he will be responsible for the President of the President ?
you can now return the mobile phones now .
you now have experienced what kind of confidence we want to build . I want to tell you of some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail on this experiment ?
what if your neigh@@ bor would have imagined only once with his name ; if he would have told where he comes , how his dog or his children are hot ?
imagine that you would have 150 ratings , which say all : &quot; he can really very well disp@@ elled mobil@@ es ! &quot;
how would you feel when you had to leave your mobile phone ?
because a well @-@ covered feedback system strengthens the confidence decisive .
in the beginning we did some things wrong .
it was difficult for the people to leave negative assess@@ ments .
in the end , we decided to wait until both the host and guest had given their arrangements before we created them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we have conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other , dependent on how similar they are at age and residence .
little surprisingly , we trust the people most , who are most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social pre @-@ bi@@ ased .
thrilling is exciting when you add the call of a person -- in our case by distribu@@ tions .
if you have less than three assess@@ ments , nothing changes .
but one has more than ten , changes everything .
a good reputation sti@@ ckers com@@ mon@@ alities .
so the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences .
furthermore , we ro@@ de that confidence is dependent on how much you are priced .
here you see the reaction to the first message of a guest .
when one tells too little , such as &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you do not get an answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you tell a lot , as for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- -- the request is also not accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so there is an optimal degree of openness , such as &quot; Tol@@ le Art &quot; in your apartment ! I make a holiday with my family holiday . &quot;
how can I create it with design to restore this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text . we also give tips on which topics you should write something .
our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudi@@ ces against stran@@ gers .
what we did not expect was the great amount of people who were more than willing to dis@@ miss these prejudi@@ ces .
here you can see how many people take our offer .
you can see three things .
firstly : incredibly good luck .
second : the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
third , a need that was not covered before .
for us the business is just very good .
of course there are times when not everything runs smoothly .
there were guests who have un@@ allowed parties celebrated or rented apartments .
hosts have guests in the rain stand .
at the beginning of the project I worked for customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the front line when confidence was broken .
there is nothing wrong than this calls . it does so , if I only think about it .
the disappointment that you hear in the voice of the ru@@ fer , and will always be our greatest motivation to continue to improve ourselves .
fortunately , from the 123 million @-@ medi@@ ated nights only had a fraction of a problem .
for people trust each other rightly .
if trust works , there can be wonder@@ full .
one of our guests made a holiday in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host took him to the hospital .
he even ended blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect house for travellers who tend to be deser@@ ted due to sitting activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
Javier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real protective gel that can save life , even though they don &apos;t know at all .
you drive one in your own car to hospital , if you die , and wait while you get a b@@ yp@@ ass .
because they don &apos;t want to feel lonely , they bring books over .
you can even stay longer without calculate the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
of course , not every stay does .
but these relations behind the pure money @-@ action are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
when I stum@@ bled about this term for the first time I asked myself :
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions together ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about an economic trade . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is now just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hire industry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the thing is not justified . &quot; &quot; &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people set up a part of themselves , and that changes everything .
if you travel nowadays , this is to compare with Fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but it is less auth@@ en@@ tically auth@@ en@@ tically .
what if travel would be a rich buffet from local impressions ?
what would be if at any place you visited , a group there would wait to show a thoroughly and to show one at a bar @-@ pent@@ our district of which one has never heard before ;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star cook ?
nowadays apartments are designed according to privacy .
what if we would like to make apartments accessible from the ground ?
how would that look like ?
what if cities would accept the thoughts of mutual share ?
I imagine cities that allow us to society and relationships , instead of lon@@ eliness and de@@ preci@@ ation .
in South Korean capital Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking places that were owned by the government ,
were now offered by residents . students who were looking for a b@@ aker ,
were convey@@ ed to people whose children were moved out . the incub@@ ator programs have been initiated ,
to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . through our platform alone today night 7@@ 85 000 people will be a guest in 191 countries in a stran@@ ger or even host .
the idea seems to be so crazy as it was brought to us .
we did not re@@ invented the wheel .
hospitality has been there before .
there have been similar sites before us .
so why has just our works ?
apart from luck and timing , we realize that you can share the right design with the components of the trust .
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
I find this amaz@@ ingly ,
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it when a red Maz@@ da drives over to me .
we obviously know that design cannot solve any problem .
but if it could help us if it had this great influence I ask myself to be able to use design soon .
thanks .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a believers ? a experts ?
maybe even a sister .
or oppressed , subjected to brain@@ washing , a terrorist attack ?
or simply a delay at the safety check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you blame for your negative impressions .
so the media are people that look like me .
a study revealed that 80 % of the report on Islam and Muslims are negative .
studies show : Americans mean , most would not know Muslims .
probably people do not speak with their U@@ ber drivers .
for those who have never met a Muslim : it is great to know you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee maker -- double es@@ presso , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a se@@ ash@@ ore @-@ fitness fan@@ atics ,
and I am a practicing , spiritual muscles .
but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not so born .
I decided to do this .
when I was 17 years old , I met the decision to ou@@ ten me .
no , not as a hom@@ os@@ exual man , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my femin@@ ist friendship were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why are you oppressed yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Lus@@ atia was , at that time , for me , it was a femin@@ ist independence , and in contrast to the pressure I felt as 17 @-@ year old , to suit me a perfect and un@@ reachable beauty ideal .
I have not only believed the faith of my parents .
I have been with the cor@@ an .
I read it , thought after , asked in question , doub@@ ted and believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow surrender that deep@@ ened with every reading of the Quran .
the beauty of the rhythm brings me sometimes to the wine .
I know myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
had you ever feel that someone you perceive , you fully understand , and yet somehow loves ?
this is how it feels .
later I married and started , like all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineering .
I later , after my marriage , a child , and lived basically the &quot; Egyptian American dream . &quot;
then that horrible morning came in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember where they were there .
I sat in my kitchen , had a mu@@ cked at the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; E@@ il@@ unsubscribe . &quot;
since was smoke , air@@ planes flew in buildings , people sp@@ ill from the buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock turned into indi@@ gn@@ ation quickly .
why should I do something ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I switched on the TV channel and heard : &quot; &quot; &quot; ... Muslim terrorists &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; on behalf of Islam &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oh , my God .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not only my country attacked , but in the N@@ u turned me the acts of others from a civil war into a susp@@ ects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the same day we had to go through the Middle West of the USA to move into a new city and begin with the construction of the building .
I remember -- when we exhau@@ sting me -- so deeply it went into my seat , and I was afraid to be recognized as a Muslim .
we moved to our apartment , in a new city , in which it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then heard , and I read the warnings of the national Muslim organizations , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be vig@@ il@@ ant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be cau@@ tious , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lead in well illuminated areas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed in the whole week .
then it was Friday at that week -- the day , where Muslims gather to the prayers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the warnings , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not go on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I saw myself the extensive coverage .
the feelings were comprehensible , understand@@ ably , and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or from people whom one held for Muslims , to the Free and struck .
there were really Bran@@ ches in mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because people who attacked this country have attacked our country .
I have put away the anger of the people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to explain itself constantly .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
nowadays , we can actually hear people : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims .
when will we get rid of them ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church as a tum@@ our in the body of the USA .
it is only the question : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
you know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tum@@ our as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor can only be found under observation .
the alternatives are meaning@@ less because the question is wrong .
Muslims are , like all other Americans , no tum@@ our in the body of the USA , but a vital organ .
thanks !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , decre@@ e and Olympi@@ ans .
will the closure of mos@@ ques are safer ?
there will be perhaps a few parking places , but do not stop terror .
the regular visit of a mosque leads to people of other faith toler@@ ant , and to show larger citizenship .
and as a leader of the police in the Washington , DC recently reported : people are actually not radi@@ cal@@ ised in mos@@ ques .
they are radi@@ cal@@ ised in their cellar or in the bed before a computer .
in the radi@@ ological process , one has found that it starts online . as a first , the person is cut off from their church , even by their family , that the person believes that terrorists are the true Muslims , and anyone who desp@@ ises their behavior and their ideology is a tra@@ itor or from faith .
if we want to prevent radi@@ cal@@ isation , we have to stop the people to go the mosque .
some are still claiming that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS establishes their brut@@ ality with the Qur &apos;an .
as a Muslim , as a mother , as a person , I think we must do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add ourselves into their imagination , if you recognize them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thanks !
the IS has so much to do with Islam , as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x @-@ Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology reasons on their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
but if you put a look at it , she does not drive what she las@@ hed in their &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality , which they read these things into the Scriptures .
an outstanding Ima@@ m told me recently an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she sho@@ wered to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was exactly the opposite . each cl@@ ergy with whom she had spoken , she brought to the silence and told her that their anger , their sense of injustice in the world , it would only bring in difficulties .
nothing inspired and something that could have been given to her anger , she was a primary goal for the instru@@ cted by extremi@@ sts who gave her a solution .
this Ima@@ m created the connection between God and its church .
instead of having accused them for their anger , he showed their constructive ways for a real change in the world .
what they learned in the mosque , keep it to join the IS .
this was an insight , as the Islam@@ opho@@ bia me and my family affects .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect anyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affects our democracy every day , on our freedom of freedom ?
one study -- actually show several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : when we fear , at least three things happen .
we are rather accepting an author@@ itarian governance system , conformity and prejudi@@ ces .
a study shows : if you have reported test persons , reported in which negative about Muslims was reported , they are rather military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumc@@ ision of rights of American Muslims .
this is not just an ac@@ adem@@ ic problem .
if you look at when the mood against Muslims down@@ wards -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in advance of the Iraq war and during two election periods .
so , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Mos@@ lem terror as I expected it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can actually be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public to under@@ mining the foundation of a free society , the sensible and well informed citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the handling of Muslims is an early War@@ n@@ sign .
we may feel it the first but the toxic air of fear prevents us all .
in the assignment of collective blame , it is not only about to explain themselves .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple that lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school .
De@@ ah was a sports@@ men .
he was at the dental faculty , talented , lots of promising ...
his sister would say to me that he was the sweet@@ est , generous man , whom she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was ast@@ ounding and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when is such a sealed young man ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne on her brother and his wife , her neighbour , Craig Stephen H@@ icks , she was assass@@ inated , just as the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an who was in the afternoon . he did it in her dwelling , as with a execution , after having posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page .
he poured out eight times on De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can be not only imm@@ oral , but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
are we gone to the mosque , or stayed safe at home ?
we thought it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about which America we want to leave our children , one that would control us through fear , or one where we can exercise our religion freely .
we chose the mosque .
with our son in the children &apos;s seat we drove Switzerland , with high pressure on the mosque .
I took him out , my shoes went out , went into the prayer hall , and what I saw I left me .
the hall was completely filled .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , than@@ ked himself and called our guests , for half of the gathered themselves Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , believers , and non @-@ believers who had come , not to attack us , but to join us .
at this moment I have collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they have courage and compassion panic and prejudi@@ ces were drawn .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose for the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
are you going to be number safe ?
or you will join them that mean : we are better than that .
many thanks .
thanks beautiful !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what do you say to those who might say that you &apos;re going to hold a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thinking with deep mind , in a class@@ y thinking factory , i.e. an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , dec@@ eive you not . I am totally normal .
I am not an exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
if you look at the Muslims around the world , and I did that with the largest ever performed study on Muslims around the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want labour and they want to live in peace .
so I am in no respect an exception .
if people seem like an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken and they are not the exception to the rule .
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for cra@@ fting , stands shortly before , to become a billion @-@ shop business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journalism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial drug . possible , this is made in research institutions worldwide .
before air @-@ net access to our social consciousness j@@ umped , has a autonomous fleet of flying machines in the F@@ RAC Centre in France live a six meters high tower from 1 500 bricks . some years ago they began to fly with rop@@ es .
by connecting trains reach high speed and acceleration to narrow space .
you can also build self @-@ permanently falling structures .
you have learned to wear bur@@ dens , handle tur@@ mo@@ il and in general react to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our goal is to exceed the limits of the possible in the autonomous flight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so that a system works aut@@ om , it needs to be collective , where in the room the mobile objects are located .
in our laboratory at ETH Zürich we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to concentrate on rapid development of dynam@@ ical Tas@@ ks .
for today &apos;s demo@@ s we use a new localization technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , a total of our laboratories .
there are no external cameras .
each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in space , to determine calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands can be found at the highest level e. g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start and &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called H@@ eck@@ starter ,
a plane that tries to beat two bas@@ ins with a cap .
as other star@@ ters , it is efficient in the down@@ ward flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all its variations .
in contrast to most star@@ ters you can float it , and therefore has large advantages when starting and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always one side @-@ side .
a restriction of yeast star@@ ters is that it is sensitive to turbul@@ ence such as wind turbines .
we develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the air machine does not matter in which position the optimal position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
during our research we often provide basic abstract questions about the core of the matter .
such a question would be for example : what is the petty @-@ possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons why you want to know the answer to such a question .
helicopter are known for example as machines with a thousand movable parts that accum@@ ulate to hurt you .
decades ago could fly out pil@@ ots remote @-@ controlled flight devices , which had only two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a rear ru@@ der .
long ago we discovered that F@@ lie with just one works .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically easy remote @-@ operated plane device . it was invented in front of shor@@ th@@ under .
it has only one movable part , a prop@@ eller ,
no fl@@ aps , hinges and Quer@@ ru@@ der , no further actu@@ ator or chec@@ ker surfaces , only a prop@@ eller .
though it is mechan@@ ically simple , happens in the inner life very much so that it can fly stable and can move across space .
nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear @-@ star@@ ters . to bring it to the fly , I have to take it correctly .
the probability that it is right to throw when all of it is low , therefore I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening .
when the mon@@ osp@@ ace is a practice in indul@@ ging , this machine is here , the om@@ ni @-@ Cop@@ ter with its eight prop@@ eller , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that he is not only symmet@@ rical .
that is why it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
in this way he receives the au@@ ral ability ,
move in the space to all directions , no matter which direction he is rot@@ ated or even as he ro@@ ses .
of course it is complex , mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers .
some is in@@ conceivable in models , the rest is split directly at the fly .
let &apos;s see this in .
when flying machines are to be part of our daily life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine consists of two separate two prop@@ eller aircraft .
this turns into clo@@ ck@@ wise direction
and the other against the clo@@ ck@@ wise .
when one builds them , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
however , something wrong -- an engine or prop@@ eller falls off , the electronics or a battery -- can fly the machine further if limited .
we will demonstrate that by making a half fli@@ ght@@ less .
the last demonstration examines synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units makes a range of aesthetic expression .
we took commercial micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ter -- every single weighs less than a sli@@ ce of bread -- and equi@@ p them with localization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where in space it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no limit .
hopefully motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine there would like to be on Broadway a f@@ lit lamp@@ shade .
of course it is difficult to predi@@ ct the influence of this technology .
for guys like us the reward in the development and the creative process lies .
it serves as a memory , how wonderful and enchanted of our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever creatures allowed to form it in so spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
many thanks .
1.3 billion years ago , in a very distant galaxy two black holes are getting together more quickly , they turned into the mass three thousand in a tenth of pure energy around .
this short moment did it shine brigh@@ ter than all stars together in all galax@@ ies of the whole of us known universe .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they do not put your energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was handed over into the space @-@ time frame itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let &apos;s arrange the events initially only time .
1.3 billion years ago there was a multi @-@ cat@@ chy life in the world .
since then , the Earth has produced some things : cor@@ als , fish , plants , sau@@ rier , people and -- God stand by us -- even the internet .
a group of about 25 years ago decided to build a group of particularly coura@@ geous -- R@@ ai Weiss from the M@@ IT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver from the Cal@@ tech -- an enormous laser det@@ ector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which arise approximately by col@@ li@@ ding black holes .
the majority held them for crazy .
but enough people recognised them as crazy genius , so the US National Science Foundation has financed their idea .
after decades of development , construction , conception and extremely much hard work they built the det@@ ector LI@@ GO : the laser Inter@@ fer@@ omet@@ er- gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ wave @-@ observ@@ atory .
in the following time , the precision of LI@@ GO could considerably increase what the recognition performance increased enormously .
therefore , it is called Advanced LI@@ GO .
at the beginning of September 2015 LI@@ GO was started for a final test run to clarify some smaller , stub@@ born problems .
on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the commissioning of the det@@ ector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two col@@ li@@ ating black holes are through the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the det@@ ector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the f@@ arewell of my to@@ d@@ ill father .
basically that were the fruits of my life .
all that I had worked , is no longer science @-@ F@@ ic@@ tion ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ c@@ rank@@ shafts made of black holes and their through observ@@ atories like LI@@ GO measurable signals . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a scr@@ ap@@ oration in the fabric of space and time .
during the temporary the wave , the space and its entire content is stretched into a direction and into the other .
for illustration lead lec@@ tur@@ ers in courses to rel@@ ativity @-@ theory often plays a proper dance .
&quot; stretching and dra@@ fts , stretching and kno@@ bs . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves are extremely weak , even ridic@@ ulous .
on 14 September , for example , each of us was stretched on the waves of the waves and stretched out . the stretching of an average person was 10 high -@@ 21 .
this means that 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 Therefore , one declared the LI@@ GO @-@ employee for crazy .
with a five kilometres long laser det@@ ector , and that &apos;s already absurd , this length would have to be measured on less than a thous@@ and@@ el of the radius of nuclear power . that &apos;s gr@@ ot@@ esque .
at the end of his classical text about gravity
described Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder , hunting for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties in the construction of such det@@ ectors are extensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ cists are angry and with the support of the public , certainly all obstacles will be overcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to LI@@ GO . Scott affir@@ ms that LI@@ GO is more a ear than an eye .
I want to explain what this means .
visible light has a wav@@ el@@ ength that is much smaller than the things around us : facial extracts , the size of your cell phones .
this is quite practical , because you can customize a picture or a map of things by taking the light around you from several points .
when killing is different .
audi@@ ble tones have a wav@@ el@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
that &apos;s why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things which means you particularly much :
the face of your child .
instead we listen to certain properties like clay and pitch , rhythm and volume , to close the history behind it .
&quot; now speaks just Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob she breaks . &quot;
&quot; du@@ mmer Bob . &quot;
the same goes for gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
with them we can not make simple pictures of objects in all .
but by paying attention to changes in am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least lie for LI@@ GO the measured frequencies in the audi@@ ble area .
so if we convert wav@@ e@@ pattern in sc@@ all , we can hear the universe literally .
the gravity to listen , can tell us about the collision of two black holes , which my colleague Scott has already been busy for a very long time .
SH : two black , not rotating holes , cir@@ cl@@ ash simple : w@@ up@@ p !
turning the two bodies very fast , you hear the same cir@@ cl@@ ash with an additional sound change . this sounds like this : W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u !
it is a kind of movement @-@ liter@@ al , shaped into the wav@@ e@@ form .
AA : on 14 September 2015 -- a date , which at least I never forget -- listening LI@@ GO : &#91; Sur@@ ren@@ al sound &#93; Jem@@ ini , who knows what he must listen , this is as sound of -- SH : ... two black holes each with 30 @-@ fold sun mass , which is about as fast as the rods of your mix@@ er .
AA : we are considering what this means .
two black holes , the dense body in space , one with a mass of 29 son@@ es , the other with a mass of 36 different , revol@@ ve around one hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know about it because we heard it .
therein lies the permanent meaning of LI@@ GO .
LI@@ GO is a completely new way to explore the Al@@ ls as it has never been possible before .
on this path we can listen to the universe and listen to the invisible .
much in space we can -- virtually or basically -- not see .
a super @-@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why mas@@ onry stars in Super@@ nov@@ ae explo@@ de .
they are very useful . of them we have learned a lot about space .
the exciting physical procedures happen but in the core that lies behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and si@@ licon .
we will never pass through , since this op@@ ak are .
gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves perme@@ ating iron , as if it would be more transparent glass . the urine would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it because the judgment is covered by its own fl@@ ashes .
using gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and the most important thing : I am optim@@ istic that in all things we have never seen before we have never seen before , and of which we do not have any idea . things that we only discover when we listen .
in fact , LI@@ GO found right in the first attempt of things that we did not expect .
my colleague at M@@ IT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the LI@@ GO project , says to this topic : me : the kind of stars that produce black holes are the dinosau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies from prehistoric times . the black holes are the Sau@@ ri@@ erk@@ no@@ chen for our archaeological work .
LI@@ GO allows us to have a completely different perspective on the events in space , on the origin of the stars and finally also on how we went out of this chaos .
AA : the challenge now consists of being as coura@@ geous as possible .
thanks to LI@@ GO we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and circulation of the cosmos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories - a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and all .
for what could be more beautiful than to listen to the urine ?
now is the time of great dreams .
do you dream with us .
thanks .
some time ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a year I would say to all &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was afraid of which I feared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no matter if it made me nervous , me in unpleasant situations , I forced me to say &quot; Yes . &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
did I want to start with the swing ?
no , no , no , yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : just what to do , I feared to rec@@ tify my fear .
my fear , speeches to keep my social fear -- Pu@@ ff , weg .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes &quot; has changed my life .
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
but there was a definite yes that changed my life to an un@@ expect@@ edly . it started with a question of my youngest .
I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ ald . and Emer@@ son , the youngest ones , calls for in@@ explic@@ able reasons all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if they were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kittens , I need milk for my beak @-@ asse &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she asked me once I could play with her when I was straight on the go . and I said , &quot; yes . &quot;
this yes was the beginning
a new attitude in my family . from there I sw@@ am to play with them whenever you ask me . no matter what I just do , or where I go , I say always Yes -- every single time .
almost . I am not perfect , but I am uns@@ ett@@ led me .
it has a magical effect on me , to my children , to our family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it also has an astonishing side effect : only recently , I really understood that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saved my career for playing with my children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have a real dream job .
I am author . I think things from , we@@ ars you to life .
dream@@ job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream@@ job .
I Cre@@ ire TV . I produce television .
I do TV , in great style .
in this TV season , I am responsible for spending 70 hours of program in the world .
four TV programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
each shipment has hundreds of jobs , which did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
a new episode all nine days times four shows , so all nine days 20 million dollars TV , three broad@@ casts , 20 episodes : sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : know To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours of television ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my TV ies run on Thursday on Thursday night .
all over the world , my series are running in 256 languages in 67 languages for 30 million people .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broad@@ casts that I have created himself , and not only produced , so still ob@@ end@@ lessly . I have to find time , really silent , creative time to gather my fans around camp@@ fire and tell my stories .
four television series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fire that burn around the world .
do you know who is doing this ?
nobody , that &apos;s why I am a Titan .
dream@@ job .
I would not like to impress you .
I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
I say to you , so that all of you who work so hard if you &apos;re talking about a company , a country or a classroom to take me seriously if I &apos;m talking about work so that I don &apos;t only understand on the computer and f@@ anta@@ si@@ ere , and it &apos;s true if I say , I understand that it is not dre@@ aming at a dream@@ job .
it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , everything blood , everything swe@@ at -- no tears .
I &apos;m working much , hard and I love it .
when I am deep@@ ened in the work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country from nothing .
it is , when I set troops up , when I turned up on a canvas .
as well you have a high tone , leaving a marathon .
it feels like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all this at the same time .
I love to work .
it is creative , mechanical , exhau@@ sting and in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ating , funny and dis@@ rup@@ tive , clin@@ ically and mother@@ ly , cru@@ el and rational . and the best thing about it is sums .
there is such a change in me if the work is running well .
a money begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the money sounds like a animated street , I could drive forever on her .
many people take their money if I &apos;m writing to them that I &apos;m writing writing that writing me joy .
understand me not wrong , this does it .
but the money -- when I began to work and work with television production when I began to work and work , build , creating and working together , I discovered this cause , this money , this energy . the money !
the sums is more than writing .
the money is action and activity . the money is a drug .
the money is music . the money is light and air .
the money is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a money , then you can not strive differently from the size .
the feeling , not otherwise to be compared to size , no matter what price .
this is called the sums .
or maybe it also means a work@@ a@@ holic .
maybe it is called genius .
maybe it is called ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I do not know .
I know only that I am not for failure , and I just know that I love the sums .
I just want to tell you , I am a Titan , and I know that I don &apos;t want to ask for it .
to put one clearly : the more successful I will , the more there are more over@@ flowing borders , the more work there , the more things at the same time , the more watch me , the more I write history , the more expectations there are .
the more I work to succeed , the more I have to work .
and what do I say about work ?
I love work , not true ?
the country , which I create , the marathon , whom I cycle , the army , the high tone , the sums , the money , the money .
I like this sums . I love the sums .
I need the sums . I am the sums .
am I only that money ?
and then it stops the money .
revised , over@@ laid , exagger@@ ated , hidden .
the money stops .
now my three daughters are acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to the truth that their m@@ ama is a single division of work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my mom will not be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and Emer@@ ald says : &quot; kittens , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da Land . &quot;
it is the children of an Tit@@ ans .
you are baby @-@ Tit@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the money stopped .
the sums of the engine was revers@@ ed .
I don &apos;t loved my job anymore . the engine was off .
the sums came not back .
my money was broken .
I made the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours days , worked out , no repentance , don &apos;t deleg@@ ate , a titanium is not , there is not , with all @-@ heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no money .
in me there was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a show @-@ Titan ,
everything was gray , I just had no more fun anymore .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the money and the money I was .
so what makes you doing if what you do , the work you love , suddenly f@@ ade ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ha@@ l thee out , stupid by the author @-@ Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know , you do it , you are doing , you love to be a teacher to be a teacher to be a teacher , a painter , Bill Gates , and knows how to stop the money if you stop the money , when the money stops , who is you then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
if the song of my heart stops , I can survive in silence ?
and then my &quot; South @-@ states wa@@ it@@ ress presents me a question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am on the way outside , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; late &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and she says , &quot; Mama , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do you play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I will already say NO , when two things are aware of :
first , I have to say Yes to everything and secondly , they did not call me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kittens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it does not call anyone more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kittens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when is that happened ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I miss it when I am Titan and my money la@@ under@@ ed , and here all changes my own eyes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so she says , &quot; Mama , &quot; Do you play ? &quot;
and I say , &quot; yes . &quot;
it is nothing special .
we play and her sisters encounter , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing unusual .
but it is outstanding , because my pain and my panic , in lon@@ eliness and in the lack of the land , I cannot do anything except suit .
I am focused .
I am silent .
the country , which I create , the marathon , whom I cycle , the army , the high tone - they no longer exist .
everything that exists is sti@@ cky finger and hum@@ id k@@ isses , delicate voices , wax sti@@ pen@@ cils and the song in which it seems to release , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so close that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breath@@ ed .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me is dis@@ sol@@ ves .
a mental door goes up and an energy club comes in .
and that is not immediately , but it happens .
I feel it .
the money slowly comes back .
no full volume , hardly there , it is quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there .
not the sums , but a money .
and now I feel like I would know a magical secret .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that is all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something that we have forgotten .
the money , the working environment , the Titan@@ ic sum , this is just the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , when I am I tell you who I am , when I describe myself with broad@@ casts and TV hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real money is .
the money is no power and it is not work @-@ specific .
it is dependent on the pleasure .
the real sums is dependent on love .
the money is the river which comes from the lust of life .
the real sums is self @-@ confidence and peace .
the real sums were ignored the pressure of history , the expectation of the tasks , the expectation and the pressure .
the real sums is simple and original .
the real money is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps my God whis@@ per@@ ed the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a Titan ?
it is just love .
we all need a bit more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say Yes .
I do this at a fixed rule , so that I can free myself as a work@@ a@@ holic from any debt .
it is law , I have no other choice . I have no choice if I want to hear the money again .
I wish it would be so simple . I am not good in games , I like it .
play not to me as well as working .
the truth does hurt ,
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work , because I love it .
I prefer at the workplace as at home .
this entry is painful , because what a person prefer to be than to house ?
well , I .
&quot; &quot; &quot; honest , I call myself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Titan &quot; &quot; &quot; -- &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of them .
we were fast in the garden , before and back , back and forth .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we cr@@ ush soap bub@@ bles .
I feel predominantly sti@@ ff , absent and confused .
I always ask for my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
my children show me how to live , and the money of the universe meets me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever stopped with the game ?
you can also do it ! let them always say Yes if your child wants to play with you .
maybe you keep me for nai@@ ve , for a dre@@ amer .
there you will probably be right , but you can also do it !
you have time !
and do you know why ? you are not Ri@@ h@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play at most 15 minutes with me until they washed out that they want to do something else .
it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a Mari@@ enk@@ le or K@@ eks replaces me .
and he speak@@ eth my teenage daughter for a whole 15 minutes with me , I am the mother of the year .
there are only 15 minutes , more requires it .
everyone can put 15 minutes a piece , even on a bad mood day !
15 minutes a piece !
no mobile phone , no clothes , no distr@@ action .
the day is short : dinner , the kids enter@@ tained .
but 15 minutes are dr@@ unken !
my children are my charity , my world . it does not have to be the children . it is true to feel the money to have a place for his soul peace .
it is not about playing with your own children . it is about joy ,
about the &quot; Play &quot; in general .
treat yourself the 15 minutes !
find out what you do well .
find out it and keep it yourself .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I don@@ ate and I si@@ ege . friends meet , books to enjoy the day --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just for everything I have given up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in training when I wanted to exceed myself more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes a piece , why not get there for a full 15 minutes ?
what can it be wrong ? nothing !
the money came back in my spare time . the money seems to return if I am not working .
working not without games .
it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office . I listen to new ideas , it fills me and my soul . I for@@ tify myself to new ideas . I use it in full attention and love my work again .
I like the money , but I don &apos;t love it .
I do not need it .
I am not the money , the money is not me ... not more .
soap bub@@ bles and sti@@ cky finger , dinner with friends .
this is my money .
the sums of life .
the sums of love .
the money of labor is part of me , but just a part . and I am so grateful .
it is snow@@ ed that I am a Titan . I have never seen a Titan , the trip to Jerusalem .
I said Yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functional . my camp@@ fire still burn .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the more clear is my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the money . the land which I create , the marathon , whom I run , the troops , the canvas , the sums , the sums , the other , the right sums : the money of life .
the more I feel this money , the more this unusual , lively , naked and new li@@ festyles in me is broad . less Titan -- more !
the more I feel exactly this money , the more I know who I am .
I am author . I think things from , I awake you to life .
this belongs to the job , that means to live his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
for a dream@@ job should be a little dream@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; want to play ? &quot;
thanks beautiful .
I am neuro@@ surgical .
as most of my colleagues I have to do with human trage@@ dies every day .
I know how to change your life from one second to another , after a serious stroke , or after an automobile accident .
for us neuro@@ surgery it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low capacity to self @-@ healing .
after a severe violation of the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , heavy disability .
that is probably the reason why I was surgical neuro@@ surgical procedure .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical interventions .
surely they have heard of one of the most known , the &quot; low @-@ stags &quot; stimulation . &quot; in doing so , one could im@@ pl@@ ore a electro@@ de deeply in the brain , in order to influence the circuit circles of the neur@@ ons that neuro@@ logical functions have been improved .
it truly is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Park@@ inson , which suffered from severe le@@ mon and heavy pain .
but Neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ surgeon is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to us .
with a little help , the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was leading Ober@@ physician and worked day and night in the emergency .
often I cat@@ ered patients with sk@@ ull @-@ stag @-@ trau@@ ma .
you need to imagine that at sk@@ ull @-@ stag @-@ trau@@ mat@@ a , the brain reveals and the sk@@ ull pressure is increasing .
to save life , one has to dimin@@ ish the sk@@ ull pressure .
there is sometimes a part of a s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist , the brain mass .
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
the cells of a tissue loss grow to be comparable with very small children that are out of your families .
you need to find the proper diet , temperature , moisture and the environment to flour@@ ish it .
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts it made Jean @-@ François .
he saw it under his micro@@ scope .
it was a great surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells that are surrounded by small , un@@ mature cells .
perhaps you still know from the bi@@ ologi@@ e@@ Less@@ ons that stem cells are un@@ ri@@ pe cells that can transform itself into any cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small incl@@ ine of the brain .
it is surprising to receive this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast .
they never die , they are imm@@ or@@ tal .
but these cells held different .
they slowly spread out and after a couple of weeks she died .
so we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells , but looked differently .
we needed long to understand where they came .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells hot Dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
you make 4 % of our grand@@ master cells .
you play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the fo@@ etus , they ensure the folding of the brain .
but why do they stay with us ?
we do not know that .
we believe that they take part in the healing of the brain because we find them in higher concentr@@ ations close to brain injuries .
this is not so safe .
but one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells .
we are facing a potential cellular source , allowing the brain healing .
this was what we had to prove .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to take a piece of brain@@ mass from the non @-@ language area , and then the cells are exactly as cultivated as it did Jean @-@ François .
and they then highlight colored , in order to be able to follow them in the brain .
in the last step we have pl@@ agu@@ ed them to the recording of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ ologist Tran@@ splan@@ tation -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we pl@@ agu@@ ed these cells in normal brain tissue tissue ? and what will happen if we pl@@ agu@@ ed the same cells in s@@ late brain@@ tissue samples ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we could work with monkeys .
in the first scenario , we pl@@ agu@@ ed the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that they were completely torn down after a few weeks , they would go back home . the room is already occupied , they will not be used there , so they disappear .
in the second scenario , we put an injury to and r@@ asp@@ ed exactly the same cells , and now the cells were preserved -- they washed up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you can see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were pl@@ agu@@ ed .
the evidence they show are these small points . these are the cells that we caught in vit@@ ro , in the culture .
here we could not stop .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain lesi@@ on ?
so we draw monkey with a manual skill task .
you had to take a feed p@@ ellets from a tablet .
they made them very good .
when they reached a stable skill level , we made the hand@@ mot@@ or@@ ic range in the motor@@ ic cor@@ tex .
then , the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could no longer move their hand .
just as it would happen to people , they spontane@@ ously recover up to a certain degree , just like after a stroke .
the patients are paraly@@ zed and then try to rec@@ u@@ perate with the help of plasti@@ que brain mechanisms . you are rec@@ u@@ perate to a certain degree , just as with the monkey .
when we were certain that the monkey has reached its degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left side you can see the monkey that spontane@@ ously recovered .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from injury .
he is not as precise and not so fast .
see now when we were pl@@ agu@@ ed the cells : the same monkey , two months after the maturity .
I can tell you that was also very exciting results for us .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can free@@ ze them and later use it .
we can use it in other neurological models , for example at Park@@ inson .
but our dream is still to im@@ plant@@ ing them in humans .
I really hope I can show you soon as the human brain gives the means to heal itself .
many thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Jo@@ cel@@ y@@ ne , this is wonderful , I am sure that straight now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who need it . &quot;
I definitely .
of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials at the human race .
Jo@@ cel@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results you have to fill about two kilograms papers and forms to go through this kind of studies .
BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and a very professional team .
BG : take a look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start the clinical studies . if you continue to look into the future how many years it will take until someone can come to hospital and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : this is difficult to say .
first , it depends on the approval of the clinical study .
will it allow us to start the authority to start it soon ?
then you have to carry this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select patients to perform and evaluate treatments if it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
then you have to apply this to a multi @-@ cent@@ ric study .
you really need to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment at any time .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : Jo@@ cel@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting TED and that you have told us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider it as natural .
we do not see democracy as the fragile plant that is in reality , but as a inventory of our society .
we tend to consider it as un@@ changing ge@@ vity .
we believe capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his big desc@@ endant in Beijing have undoubtedly proved that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
indeed , democracy comes with us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was clear to me as finance minister in the Euro@@ group , that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- not likely to affect austerity programs that were realized in Greece .
at this moment I thought there might be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my sincere friends told me that democracy would be abol@@ ished if it would change anything .
at this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for genuine democracy .
I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of a mistake , we could save ourselves the democracy but that we need a true and def@@ ective democracy .
because without democracy our societies are ma@@ stered , our future ble@@ ak and our great , new technologies are wast@@ ed .
on the topic of waste , I would like to refer you to an interesting contradiction , which is currently under threat to our economies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twin Summit &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a summit is known to you . they know and recognize him as the Schul@@ den@@ berg who casts its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the Schul@@ den@@ berg ,
but few of them realize his Gem@@ ini @-@ type .
a mountain of un@@ used cash , which is to be anxi@@ ous , but they are too anxi@@ ous to invest there where it would be productive and in@@ comes to produce , with which one could produce the school@@ berg and also produce all the things that humanity urgently needed , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
in the past 3 months in the United States , in England and in the Eurozone , 3,@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion dollars invested in all the wealth of goods such as industrial plants , machinery , office building , schools , streets , tracks , equipment and so on and so forth .
3.@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars sounds like a lot of money , until one compar@@ es with the 5,@@ 1 tri@@ l@@ lion dollars that have been ro@@ ught the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing to do except the stock exchanges and the real estate prices .
thus , debt and in@@ productive capital form the twin summit , which is not the same due to the usual market mechanisms .
the result are stag@@ nating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 years old in the US , Japan and Europe , and therefore a low overall economic demand that could not invest in which they do not invest . just like o@@ edi@@ pus father , which could not be true in which they would not invest . just like oils , the prophecy of the ov@@ ens could be true that his son would kill him if he will grow ,
un@@ seas@@ oned the circumstances caused , which lead to that o@@ di@@ pus kill him .
this is my ha@@ ste with capitalism --
its exce@@ ed@@ der@@ ous art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to develop our lives , to develop human talents and to finance all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are crucial for the salvation of the earth .
is democracy the solution ?
I already think . but before we continue : what do we understand by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le @-@ defined democracy as the social form , in which the Free and the poor control the government as a majority .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy closed naturally too many --
women , aliens , and of course slaves .
however , it would be an error , the significance of the ath@@ ic democracy due to these incl@@ usions .
the decisive factor in the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that it gave to the working poor , and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more importantly , and crucial that they can give them the right to political co @-@ determination with equal mo@@ ods in questions of state power .
the ath@@ ic democracy has not kept a long time --
as a candle , which shines very light , it is also fast hidden .
however , our present @-@ liberal democr@@ acies do not have its roots in the ancient Athens .
but at the Magna C@@ arta , in the Gl@@ orious Revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American Constitution .
while the ath@@ ic democracy focused on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Magna C@@ arta , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for ruling class .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the liberal democracy was only possible when a full separation of politics and economy is possible and the democratic process was bor@@ dered on policy , while the economy was the world of corporations -- a democratic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democratic zone &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in our contemporary democr@@ acies , since the time that this separation of politics and economics began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two by the economy gradually immig@@ rated to politics and escaped them .
wonder why the politicians are no longer as they are earlier ?
it is not on a de@@ generation of their DNA .
it is because that one cannot be in the government today , and still not in power , because the power is inter@@ viewed from politics into the economy and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my ha@@ ste with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is in about as a herd of rob@@ ber@@ ing that sustain@@ ably the animals , of which they nour@@ ished , dec@@ ei@@ ving that they are star@@ ving at the end .
similarly , it is similar to the economy that has become the politics so far ahead . the power of corporations grows , political goods are de@@ valu@@ ated to increase inequality , the overall economic demand and the managing director of corporations are too frigh@@ tened to invest the cash of their business .
the more successful the capitalism has exp@@ els the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; &#91; the people &#93; out of democracy , the higher the twin summit , and the greater the wast@@ age of human labour power and the welfare of humanity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if this is true , it is obvious that we have to bring the policy and the economy again , and it would be better when the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control it , as in the ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a new idea .
the Marxist left had this idea already 100 years ago and it didn &apos;t flow well .
the doctrine from the Deb@@ ak@@ el of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can recover only by a wonder like in the ancient Athens without creating new species of brut@@ ality and extravag@@ ance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there is a solution : the working poor ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
capitalism does it by replacing Ni@@ ed@@ ri@@ glo@@ hn@@ y through automation and robots .
the problem is , as long as economy and politics are separate areas , the automation can be higher , the duplication , and social conflicts lower , like it -- already very soon as I think -- in countries like China will come .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to shape the economy and re@@ unite the business areas of economy and politics , and ensure that we do the re@@ united area , otherwise we end in a path@@ ological surveillance system that will appear the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the question is not whether capitalism has the technical achievements which he has brought forth , will survive --
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is &quot; solved by a d@@ yst@@ er , similar to the &quot; star Tre@@ k &quot; in which machines are serving the human beings , and people put their energy into the research of the universe , or into a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans &quot; A@@ gora , &quot; in long talks the meaning of life .
I believe we may be optim@@ istic .
so what do so , how could it look like this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; matrix &quot; -@@ similar cor@@ yst@@ ia ?
in the practical implementation I would like to give you a few examples soon .
in the field of companies : ask yourself a capital market where you earn money while you work and where your capital will help you from a job to next , from a company to the next , and the company -- no matter in which one is currently working -- is property of those who work in the company .
then all income deri@@ ves from capital and from exhaus@@ tion and the concept of wage labor is completely obsol@@ ete .
no distinction between those who belong to the companies , but are not working in it , and employees who work there , but no do@@ cking more between capital and labour , no big gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no cont@@ empor@@ al ten@@ ess summit .
in the field of global political economy , please note that our national currencies would have a free swe@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest threshold &#93; , in the interests of all of mankind .
continue to be tra@@ ded that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in that currency -- we call it &quot; the cosmos , &quot; in units of &quot; cosmos &quot; -- and every government pays the sum which corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade surplus from the respective country into a common fund .
imagine that this fund is investing in &quot; green &quot; technologies , particularly in parts of the world in which investment funds are ra@@ ved .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes had proposed in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
today , we have it , especially against the background of a re@@ unified policy and economy .
the world that I describe , is at the same time liber@@ ated , in which it is privileged persons preferred , and Marxist since it is buried the separation of capital and labour in the du@@ st@@ bin of history , and key@@ n@@ esi@@ an@@ ically , globally key@@ n@@ esian .
but above all , it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy .
will we awaken into such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar ad@@ mitt@@ ent ?
the answer depends on how we work together politically .
it is in our hands , and we do it better democr@@ atically .
thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself in your biography itself as liber@@ t@@ arian Marxi@@ sts .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something of what I have just said , then Marx is relevant .
the reason for re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... do we do that , technological development will generate a massive decline in economic demand , which lar@@ ry Sum@@ mer is called &quot; long @-@ term st@@ agnation . &quot;
by transferring this crisis from a part of Earth to the next , as we do it today , it will not only dest@@ abili@@ ze our democr@@ acies , but also the countries whose interest in liber@@ alism is low .
if this analysis is accurate , Marx is quite relevant ,
likewise , as Hay@@ ek , I am a liber@@ t@@ ary Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and therefore I am also perfect .
BG : actually , and now we are at ease too .
Y@@ V : if you are not wir@@ r , you do not think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein , who said this . BG : in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you have said very clearly what you keep from the perspective of the West on China .
do you want to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democr@@ acies , we have the semb@@ lance of democracy .
as I said in my presentation , we have limited democracy to politics while the area , where most of the economy plays -- the area of economy -- a whole @-@ democratic zone .
in some ways , if I must say so pro@@ voc@@ ative , China today resembles the England of the 19th century .
because -- do you remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism to democracy -- this is an error , historically considered .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ al , like John Stu@@ art Mill --
he was particularly skep@@ tical of what the democratic development concerns .
what we can observe now in China resembles the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China now has to propose to do what the West has done in the 19th century , smells of violent to hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : I &apos;m sure that many hear@@ ers are curious to your experiences as Minister of Finance at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I reck@@ oned that that comes .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later on the first half @-@ year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very disappointing , because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
namely , let us say goodbye to the self @-@ suffici@@ ency , and the continuous denial that a massive displ@@ aced line through the Eurozone continues , and continues to massi@@ vely increase the development of the entire European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had the opportunity to be on the basis of the Greek proposal -- by the way , the first proposal was , which revealed this denial -- &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately it is right to do . unfortunately , the powers within the eurozone , within the European group , continues to deny the denial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what is coming .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if you are trying a business system , which is not viable , through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism in life , it will perhaps delay a while , but if then the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rupt and destructive .
BG : what changes do you see ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future if we do not change their construction .
BG : do you have any mistakes in your time as finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- seriously ...
if there is a finance minister , or any minister who claims after 6 months in office , particularly in such a tense situation , he made no mistake , then this is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest error was to sign the request for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on the sides of the don@@ ors to find a common solution .
but this did not exist .
they merely wanted to bring our government to fall , only because they didn &apos;t want to deal with the pre@@ ach@@ ments , which went through the eurozone .
they did not want to conc@@ ede that they have been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
there is worse than the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; none of the Troika of the don@@ ors who have imposed us this policy , and one : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive ton@@ ic of talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone towards someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my greatest fear is that the eurozone is not survived .
for if it does not survive , the inter@@ connected fli@@ ers will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will not be cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire global economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we allow ourselves to hit the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 , that it appears to me , it will also be detri@@ mental to the future of Europeans and non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope that you are wrong in this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you so much that you were at TED .
Y@@ V : thanks .
by Roy Price most of you have never heard , although he is probably responsible for 22 @-@ sized minutes of your life on 19th April 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you .
this goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is a leading at Amazon Studios ,
the TV @-@ production company from Amazon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has a I@@ gel@@ and and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; movies , TV , Technology , Tac@@ os . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for it , shows the shows and the content to produce the Amazon .
of course this is a very hard @-@ fought industry .
there are so many TV series that Roy did not choose any one .
he has to find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he has to find shows that are right on this curve .
this curve is the rating distribution of over 2500 TV series on the IM@@ D@@ b website . the rating continues from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows get this review .
your show will be rated at nine and higher , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows how &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; The Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that make addi@@ ctive , where , after having a season , your brain asks , &quot; where are there any more of these episodes ? &quot;
this type of show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the left side , here at this end , shows how &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ aras &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- -- this should tell you enough what is going on at the end of the curve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roy Price does not take care of being on the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to offer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ aras . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is more thinking about the mean explo@@ iting , the average television -- the shows , which are neither good nor bad , they simply do not inspire .
so he must make sure that he really is on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course it is the first time that Amazon does something , that &apos;s why Roy Price do not risk anything .
he wants to create successes .
he needs a guaranteed success , so it keeps a contest .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and cho@@ oses eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online , where they can look at everyone free of charge .
and if Amazon &apos;s free stuff out there , one finds it right ?
millions of spectators have a look at these episodes .
however they don &apos;t know that they will be observed when looking at this shows .
they are observed by Roy and his team who absorb everything .
you grasp when you start the show when you pause , which parts you ski@@ ps or re @-@ looking .
you collect millions of data to decide with these data , which show they should produce .
in fact , they gather the data , process and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com over four republi@@ can networks . &quot;
you made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but it seems that many people can remember this show because it was not so good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is only an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- since the average of this curve is 7,@@ 4 and Alpha House is in 7.5 -- i.e. something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked .
about at the same time at another company , another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always looking to find this a Super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it something different .
instead of holding a contest , he and his team got the available data on the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the reviews they give the shows , their course , which shows they like etc .
then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience : what shows they like , which producers , which actors .
when they had all the parts together , they entered a wagon and decided not to make a Sit@@ com over four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a Senator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has led to a hit , at least for the first two rel@@ ays .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9,@@ 1 review on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
of course the question is : what happened here ?
you have two very com@@ peti@@ tive , data sealed companies .
they connect them with each other and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because logic somehow states that this should work with everything .
if one collects millions of data , for a decision that you meet , then one should make a good decision .
you have 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
it is optimized by very powerful computer .
the minus what you can expect is good TV , or ?
if data analysis does not work , then this is something frigh@@ tening because we live in a time where we can hold more and more statistics to make serious decisions far beyond television .
does someone here know the company multi @-@ health system ?
nobody . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that nobody in this room will ever get in touch with this software . come in touch with it , you are in prison .
if someone is in prison here in the US and ask for release , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a mis@@ sal is made or not .
just like at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of decide whether a show is good or bad , will be decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate television , 22 minutes , this can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results generated . this is not that a company like multi @-@ health system does not know how to use data .
also , the data sealed companies are wrong .
yes , even Google makes mistakes .
2009 gave Google known that they can say through data analysis out@@ breaks of flu , the lim@@ est way -- through data analysis of Google research .
it worked wonderfully and was a great news of news . the success poison@@ ed in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
it worked properly , year round year , until it suddenly worked out more ,
and no one could say why .
it simply does not work , this was again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data diversi@@ fication companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
despite all these errors , data streams in decisions of life -- in the workplace , in the legal composition , in medicine .
so we should rather make sure that data are helpful .
also I know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded genetics -- an area where some very clever people un@@ imaginable many data to make serious decisions as the decision for cancer therapy
or the development of a medicine . over the years I have recognized some samples about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
have you ever solve a complex problem , do mainly do two things :
as a first break , this problem appears in its parts , so that you can analyze the items ; as a result , you put the items back together to put a decision .
sometimes you need to do this several times , but there are always two things : apart and put together again .
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how power@@ fully , can only help create a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision .
there is another tool for this and we all possess it : our brain .
if there is something that the brain is good , it is parts and pieces re@@ comp@@ ose , even if the information is incomplete in order to take a good decision - especially when it is the brain of an expert .
therefore , I think , Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they have data and mind , where they are also included in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience , why they otherwise would not have been capable of . but the decision on how to take all of these parts again , put together a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; that &apos;s not in the data .
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant that they entered a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon on the other hand did this in the wrong way .
you used to control all their choices , first as they chose TV @-@ ideas , then when they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a Show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they tell us the data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired outcome .
data is helpful for better decisions , but I believe things go wrong when data are starting to control our decisions .
no matter how power@@ fully they are , data are just a tool and not to forget that this device is quite useful .
many of you will be ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; it is amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or no @-@ question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most likely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- exactly here at this moment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will see it later with a technology demo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have previously made some decisions in my life , whereby I should listen to the ball in retro@@ spect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but , as you know of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace it with something much broader than data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
that is perhaps the ball cl@@ ush and clever and clever . ultimately , it is up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right corner .
and I find this as a very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data still pays out to make decisions , an expert in what you do , and risks .
because in the end it is not the data , but the risks that you end at the right end of the curve .
thanks beautiful .
