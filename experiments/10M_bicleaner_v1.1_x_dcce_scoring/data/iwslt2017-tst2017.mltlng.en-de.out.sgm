<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You may know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times Reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before anyone had heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he is spectacular that the NSA have illegally listened to the phones of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a permanent impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation in which the CIA gave literally drafts for an atomic bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If the crazy sounds, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible history.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who the chapter did not fall at all?</seg>
<seg id="9">The US government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "almost 10 years the government has been determined against raisen and urged him to call his" "" "public sources" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">In this move he became a symbol of the pattern of government, whistleblowers to condemn and to defeat journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the first constitutional referendum, the media has the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if media cannot get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the mud that they will give.</seg>
<seg id="14">So as the government in Risen, he did something, what many courageous reporter had already done before him: he refused and said that he would prefer to go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk to go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the process, something extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, even though they have been granted for years, that it would be imperative in their case, the demands of the government were dropped off.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring, reporter and sources can always hide less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rather than to fail and bring forward-ups to the statements, you could also carry out his digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators shall be concerned without his consent, his telephone calls secret,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like his e-mail data, financial and banking information, its credit return, and even travel reports with the list of its flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblower and risens supposed source.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, this is just one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect Whistleblowers, but instead the judiciary has more condemns us than all U.S. governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government is too much from their work as geheim.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11 almost every article on national security was the result of that a whistle-blowers went to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">So we put the press coverage into the game that should be protected by the first Constitutional Court, because the government has always more possibilities to do all.</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as technology has allowed the government to handle the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">And indeed, they can do that from the moment they get in touch rather than in retrospect, in the testimony of the testimony.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today, there is communication software that has not yet been written as a Risen book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">A such technology is SecureDrop, an open source transmission system for whistleblowers, which was originally developed by the internet-famous, which was developed by us against Aaron Swartz, and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation in which I have been working.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news site, just like the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="33">You can upload or send information to documents, as with any ordinary contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">This will then be encrypted and stored on a server, to which only the respective message agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government cannot obtain any more information secretly, and many of the information they would ask would be available from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect press freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">"" "" "" "unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new spy technologies that endanger us all." ""</seg>
<seg id="38">It is to us to ensure that not only technology inator such as Edward Snowden have a way to give misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblowers,</seg>
<seg id="39">Those who want to report more abnormalities in the care of soldiers. or the next environmental workers who suggests the alarm for sighted water from Flint. or a Wallstreet-Insider that warns us before the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">After all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes, but to protect our all constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on 3 April 2016, the largest data leak of history was published.] [we baten Robert Palmer from Global Witness on a declaration.] This week we were told by news about a Leck of 11 million documents of the law firm Mosshon in Panama.]</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">We get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers have to companies such as mosbag Fonseca and say: "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the e-mails, the exchange of messages as the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already resulted in the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland Prime Minister is resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">Also, there are reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator BBashar al-Assad mailbox in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russia President Vladimir Putin leads to over a tight friend of children's days, a famous Cellists.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of rich people and others who wait for the next release, and to the next unveiled documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now that sounds like the Plot of an agent or a John-Grisham-novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems to cries from you, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should us see what happened?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is, if the rich and mighty men are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not all of their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And this affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">In the whole world, media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens are used by some few to hide their assets and concealed their assets -- something that we have been discussing and revealing ourselves for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people will appear this whole world very confusing, and it's hard to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it like a matrjovice-chapel.</seg>
<seg id="60">So one has a firm in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these prayers.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "it can be very difficult for criminal enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what is happening." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it interesting that in the US there are fewer reports on this matter.</seg>
<seg id="63">Presumably because there were so far no prominent Americans who came in these revelations, this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not so that there are no wealthy Americans to hide their assets in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">However, by the principle of which this tax havens function, mosbag Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a backup of the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, it is so that in some US states it needs less information to provide less information to establish a company than to get a librcard.</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of intransparent in the US has allowed employees from school districts to gamble school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It also permits scammers to abstain from special investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does that actually work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent an uncovered investigator at the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator gave himself as African minister, who wanted to bring suspected money to the USA to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked it that all went up to an Advocate of our investigators, how he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">These were all occurrences. none of these lawyers took us as clients and of course no money was handed over to anyone. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as a single case.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer, which made our uncovered investigator suggestions.</seg>
<seg id="79">It is not about a single leading policymakers, wrapped in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It is about how the system works, established by the corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to cope with this, we must change the rules.</seg>
<seg id="82">We have to change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult.</seg>
<seg id="83">This may sound very nasty as if we could do nothing about it; as if nothing could have changed, as if it is always the rich and powerful ones.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a saluted optimist, I see that some things have begun to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">Over the past few years we have witnessed more transparency, what the owners of companies are concerned.</seg>
<seg id="86">The subject took political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G8 Summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU is recorded in central registers at the national level who really lies behind firms in Europe and who controls them.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have introduced a legislative draft in both parliamentarians, but this does not make the progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how these Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, used as a means to ensure more transparency in the US and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for changes.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who are angry if they see how other people can hide their true identity behind projectors.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need executives in the economy that arise and say:" "" "Intransparent is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "we need leading politicians who recognise the problem and use it to end this kind of transparency through laws." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">Together we can finish the intransparent, which now makes this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering, finally end.</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story, as I was almost kidnapped and in the trunk of a red Mazowy it would be.</seg>
<seg id="97">A day after I finished my design study, I made a backhofale.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the Red Mazda remained and looked like my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just took a road trip through the whole country. afterwards he would go to the peaccorps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him into a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "as we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him," "" "where do you sleep today?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">"" "he made the whole thing worse:" "" "I do not know yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought: "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got to know him! he says he would go to the peacemps, but I don't know if he really is planning this. I will not kidnapped in the trunk of a grain that land.</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk-room!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard myself:" "" "I have a air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "a voice in my head said," "" "Better, how please?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I was then in bed, I deeply moved to the ceiling and thought: "Oh husband! what have I rocked myself down?</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild alien in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such fear that I got out of bed, on ten points on the door, and my bedroom door closed.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The artwork he had bought from me today is in his classrooms. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has completely changed my view.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood as strangers, actually friends, who were only waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">People on my balloon, was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's take a while, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I am unemployed, almost bankrupt, my fellow-inhabitants draws from and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that there was a design conference in the city at that time. all the hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I believe creativity can do it to transform fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I survived how we could earn something about it. our apartment will accommodate a designer Bed and Breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk, including a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a site and founded so 'airmattress and breakfast "[AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the airmat on wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it great, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I am sure our cheese-ham omeltettes was completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them through the whole city. when we passed our last guest and the door to the castle fell, stared Brian and me.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">The things came into roles.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former co-inhabitants, Nates Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out whether one could make it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented our investors: "we want to create a website where people publicly post images of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of room, whose doors you are closed when visiting.</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the internet you can join wild people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited, that the rocket would ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But indeed they do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">Nobody who is still completely at Trost, would invest in a business, the strangers allowed to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we as children all have learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, you said to things that you can do well. we could desigail.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie we learned that design is much more than just looks and haptics -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to designt objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust through design, between people who have never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design afford as something?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample, which degree confidence we asped.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-seconds experiment. it will force you out of your comfort.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up if you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Give your unlock mobile phone to your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">This silent approach of panic that you can now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">For the only thing is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your text, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the undisturbed cell of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So most of the guests feel even if they stay elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason can our company exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Only once, who has now actually Al Gores mobile?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you announce on Twitter that he will be responsible for the President of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the mobile phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You now have experienced what kind of confidence we want to build. I want to tell you of some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail on this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor would have imagined only once with his name; if he would have told where he comes, how his dog or his children are hot?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine that you would have 150 ratings, which say all: "he can really very well dispelled mobiles!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you had to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-covered feedback system strengthens the confidence decisive.</seg>
<seg id="173">In the beginning we did some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was difficult for the people to leave negative assessments.</seg>
<seg id="175">In the end, we decided to wait until both the host and guest had given their arrangements before we created them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We have conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how likely it is that people trust each other, dependent on how similar they are at age and residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprisingly, we trust the people most, who are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social pre-biased.</seg>
<seg id="181">Thrilling is exciting when you add the call of a person -- in our case by distributions.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three assessments, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But one has more than ten, changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation stickers commonalities.</seg>
<seg id="185">So the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">Furthermore, we rode that confidence is dependent on how much you are priced.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reaction to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">When one tells too little, such as "Hi!," you do not get an answer.</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "you tell a lot, as for example:" "" "I have problems with my mother" "" "-- -- the request is also not accepted." ""</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimal degree of openness, such as "Tolle Art" in your apartment! I make a holiday with my family holiday. "</seg>
<seg id="191">How can I create it with design to restore this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text. we also give tips on which topics you should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not expect was the great amount of people who were more than willing to dismiss these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you can see how many people take our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">Firstly: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third, a need that was not covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us the business is just very good.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times when not everything runs smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have unallowed parties celebrated or rented apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have guests in the rain stand.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked for customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the front line when confidence was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing wrong than this calls. it does so, if I only think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that you hear in the voice of the rufer, and will always be our greatest motivation to continue to improve ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, from the 123 million-mediated nights only had a fraction of a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">For people trust each other rightly.</seg>
<seg id="210">If trust works, there can be wonderfull.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made a holiday in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host took him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even ended blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travellers who tend to be deserted due to sitting activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real protective gel that can save life, even though they don't know at all.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive one in your own car to hospital, if you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want to feel lonely, they bring books over.</seg>
<seg id="220">You can even stay longer without calculate the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">Of course, not every stay does.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money-action are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled about this term for the first time I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money transactions together?</seg>
<seg id="226">"" "" "" "it is about an economic trade." ""</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "but it is now just" "" "hire industry" "", "the thing is not justified." ""</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People set up a part of themselves, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">If you travel nowadays, this is to compare with Fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but it is less authentically authentically.</seg>
<seg id="231">What if travel would be a rich buffet from local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What would be if at any place you visited, a group there would wait to show a thoroughly and to show one at a bar-pentour district of which one has never heard before;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star cook?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays apartments are designed according to privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to make apartments accessible from the ground?</seg>
<seg id="236">How would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the thoughts of mutual share?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that allow us to society and relationships, instead of loneliness and depreciation.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korean capital Seoul, this project has already begun. many parking places that were owned by the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Were now offered by residents. students who were looking for a baker,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were conveyed to people whose children were moved out. the incubator programs have been initiated,</seg>
<seg id="242">To finance new start-ups in the Share Economy. through our platform alone today night 785 000 people will be a guest in 191 countries in a stranger or even host.</seg>
<seg id="243">The idea seems to be so crazy as it was brought to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality has been there before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There have been similar sites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why has just our works?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from luck and timing, we realize that you can share the right design with the components of the trust.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find this amazingly,</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it when a red Mazda drives over to me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We obviously know that design cannot solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us if it had this great influence I ask myself to be able to use design soon.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believers? a experts?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or oppressed, subjected to brainwashing, a terrorist attack?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay at the safety check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media are people that look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of the report on Islam and Muslims are negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: Americans mean, most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people do not speak with their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For those who have never met a Muslim: it is great to know you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee maker -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A seashore-fitness fanatics,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing, spiritual muscles.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not so born.</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do this.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 years old, I met the decision to outen me.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as a homosexual man, like some of my friends, but as a Muslim. I decided to wear the Hijab, my head.</seg>
<seg id="277">"" "my feminist friendship were horrified:" "" "why are you oppressed yourself?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="278">The Lusatia was, at that time, for me, it was a feminist independence, and in contrast to the pressure I felt as 17-year old, to suit me a perfect and unreachable beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only believed the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have been with the coran.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought after, asked in question, doubted and believed.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was trust and slow surrender that deepened with every reading of the Quran.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythm brings me sometimes to the wine.</seg>
<seg id="285">I know myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Had you ever feel that someone you perceive, you fully understand, and yet somehow loves?</seg>
<seg id="287">This is how it feels.</seg>
<seg id="288">Later I married and started, like all the good Egyptians, my career as an engineering.</seg>
<seg id="289">I later, after my marriage, a child, and lived basically the "Egyptian American dream."</seg>
<seg id="290">Then that horrible morning came in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">I sat in my kitchen, had a mucked at the end, looked at the screen and saw the word "Eilunsubscribe."</seg>
<seg id="293">Since was smoke, airplanes flew in buildings, people spill from the buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disorder?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock turned into indignation quickly.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should I do something?</seg>
<seg id="299">"" "I switched on the TV channel and heard:" ""... Muslim terrorists "" "..." "" "..." on behalf of Islam "" "..."... "" "..." "" "..." ""... "" ""... "" "..." "" "</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh, my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">"" "" "" "it is not only my country attacked, but in the Nu turned me the acts of others from a civil war into a suspects." ""</seg>
<seg id="302">On the same day we had to go through the Middle West of the USA to move into a new city and begin with the construction of the building.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember -- when we exhausting me -- so deeply it went into my seat, and I was afraid to be recognized as a Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved to our apartment, in a new city, in which it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">"" "and then heard, and I read the warnings of the national Muslim organizations, said:" "" "be vigilant," "" "be cautious," "" "lead in well illuminated areas" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed in the whole week.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday at that week -- the day, where Muslims gather to the prayers.</seg>
<seg id="308">"" "and again the warnings," "" "does not go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw myself the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">The feelings were comprehensible, understandably, and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or from people whom one held for Muslims, to the Free and struck.</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really Branches in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because people who attacked this country have attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I have put away the anger of the people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to explain itself constantly.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing against questions, I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">It is the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Nowadays, we can actually hear people: "there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we get rid of them? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church as a tumour in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">It is only the question: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malignant tumour as a whole and a benign tumor can only be found under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are meaningless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims are, like all other Americans, no tumour in the body of the USA, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, decree and Olympians.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques are safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">There will be perhaps a few parking places, but do not stop terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit of a mosque leads to people of other faith tolerant, and to show larger citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a leader of the police in the Washington, DC recently reported: people are actually not radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or in the bed before a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">In the radiological process, one has found that it starts online. as a first, the person is cut off from their church, even by their family, that the person believes that terrorists are the true Muslims, and anyone who despises their behavior and their ideology is a traitor or from faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalisation, we have to stop the people to go the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some are still claiming that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS establishes their brutality with the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="339">As a Muslim, as a mother, as a person, I think we must do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add ourselves into their imagination, if you recognize them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam, as the Ku-Klux-Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology reasons on their "Holy Book."</seg>
<seg id="344">But if you put a look at it, she does not drive what she lashed in their "Holy Scripture."</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality, which they read these things into the Scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam told me recently an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she showered to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said the problem was exactly the opposite. each clergy with whom she had spoken, she brought to the silence and told her that their anger, their sense of injustice in the world, it would only bring in difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="350">Nothing inspired and something that could have been given to her anger, she was a primary goal for the instructed by extremists who gave her a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam created the connection between God and its church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of having accused them for their anger, he showed their constructive ways for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What they learned in the mosque, keep it to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight, as the Islamophobia me and my family affects.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect anyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affects our democracy every day, on our freedom of freedom?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually show several neuroscientific studies -- show: when we fear, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We are rather accepting an authoritarian governance system, conformity and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study shows: if you have reported test persons, reported in which negative about Muslims was reported, they are rather military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look at when the mood against Muslims downwards -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in advance of the Iraq war and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So, Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Moslem terror as I expected it.</seg>
<seg id="365">"" "" "" "it can actually be a tool to manipulate the public to undermining the foundation of a free society, the sensible and well informed citizens." ""</seg>
<seg id="366">The handling of Muslims is an early Warnsign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it the first but the toxic air of fear prevents us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the assignment of collective blame, it is not only about to explain themselves.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple that lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a sportsmen.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was at the dental faculty, talented, lots of promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would say to me that he was the sweetest, generous man, whom she knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was astounding and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"" "" "" "when is such a sealed young man?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="375">Just a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne on her brother and his wife, her neighbour, Craig Stephen Hicks, she was assassinated, just as the sister of Yusor, Razan who was in the afternoon. he did it in her dwelling, as with a execution, after having posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="376">He poured out eight times on Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism can be not only immoral, but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Are we gone to the mosque, or stayed safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We thought it and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was about which America we want to leave our children, one that would control us through fear, or one where we can exercise our religion freely.</seg>
<seg id="382">We chose the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the children's seat we drove Switzerland, with high pressure on the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, my shoes went out, went into the prayer hall, and what I saw I left me.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made an announcement, thanked himself and called our guests, for half of the gathered themselves Christians, Jews, Buddhists, believers, and non-believers who had come, not to attack us, but to join us.</seg>
<seg id="387">At this moment I have collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they have courage and compassion panic and prejudices were drawn.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose for the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Are you going to be number safe?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or you will join them that mean: we are better than that.</seg>
<seg id="393">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thanks beautiful!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have hit a nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder what do you say to those who might say that you're going to hold a TEDTalk, a thinking with deep mind, in a classy thinking factory, i.e. an exception and not the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say, deceive you not. I am totally normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am not an exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I am as usual as it is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="402">If you look at the Muslims around the world, and I did that with the largest ever performed study on Muslims around the world, people want normal things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want prosperity for the family, they want labour and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I am in no respect an exception.</seg>
<seg id="405">If people seem like an exception to rule, then often the rule has been broken and they are not the exception to the rule.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: thank you. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">What began as a platform for crafting, stands shortly before, to become a billion-shop business.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drug. possible, this is made in research institutions worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air-net access to our social consciousness jumped, has a autonomous fleet of flying machines in the FRAC Centre in France live a six meters high tower from 1 500 bricks. some years ago they began to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting trains reach high speed and acceleration to narrow space.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-permanently falling structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">You have learned to wear burdens, handle turmoil and in general react to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">"" "" "" "our goal is to exceed the limits of the possible in the autonomous flight." ""</seg>
<seg id="415">So that a system works autom, it needs to be collective, where in the room the mobile objects are located.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zürich we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to concentrate on rapid development of dynamical Tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos we use a new localization technology of Verity Studios, a total of our laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in space, to determine calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "external commands can be found at the highest level e. g." "" "start and" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called Heckstarter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A plane that tries to beat two basins with a cap.</seg>
<seg id="423">As other starters, it is efficient in the downward flight, much more efficient than helicopters in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most starters you can float it, and therefore has large advantages when starting and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always one side-side.</seg>
<seg id="426">A restriction of yeast starters is that it is sensitive to turbulence such as wind turbines.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the air machine does not matter in which position the optimal position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research we often provide basic abstract questions about the core of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be for example: what is the petty-possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons why you want to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopter are known for example as machines with a thousand movable parts that accumulate to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago could fly out pilots remote-controlled flight devices, which had only two movable parts: a propeller and a rear ruder.</seg>
<seg id="435">Long ago we discovered that Flie with just one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monospinner, the mechanically easy remote-operated plane device. it was invented in front of shorthunder.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only one movable part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No flaps, hinges and Querruder, no further actuator or checker surfaces, only a propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Though it is mechanically simple, happens in the inner life very much so that it can fly stable and can move across space.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear-starters. to bring it to the fly, I have to take it correctly.</seg>
<seg id="441">The probability that it is right to throw when all of it is low, therefore I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening.</seg>
<seg id="442">When the monospace is a practice in indulging, this machine is here, the omni-Copter with its eight propeller, an exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that he is not only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why it is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">In this way he receives the aural ability,</seg>
<seg id="447">Move in the space to all directions, no matter which direction he is rotated or even as he roses.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course it is complex, mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some is inconceivable in models, the rest is split directly at the fly.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's see this in.</seg>
<seg id="451">When flying machines are to be part of our daily life, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine consists of two separate two propeller aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">This turns into clockwise direction</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against the clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When one builds them, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">However, something wrong -- an engine or propeller falls off, the electronics or a battery -- can fly the machine further if limited.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate that by making a half flightless.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration examines synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units makes a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took commercial micro-quadcopter -- every single weighs less than a slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where in space it is and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully motivate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine there would like to be on Broadway a flit lampshade.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For guys like us the reward in the development and the creative process lies.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a memory, how wonderful and enchanted of our universe is, and that it allows creative, clever creatures allowed to form it in so spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="469">1.3 billion years ago, in a very distant galaxy two black holes are getting together more quickly, they turned into the mass three thousand in a tenth of pure energy around.</seg>
<seg id="470">This short moment did it shine brighter than all stars together in all galaxies of the whole of us known universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they do not put your energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was handed over into the space-time frame itself and the universe exploded in gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let's arrange the events initially only time.</seg>
<seg id="476">1.3 billion years ago there was a multi-catchy life in the world.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then, the Earth has produced some things: corals, fish, plants, saurier, people and -- God stand by us -- even the internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">A group of about 25 years ago decided to build a group of particularly courageous -- Rai Weiss from the MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from the Caltech -- an enormous laser detector to search for gravitational waves, which arise approximately by colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">The majority held them for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognised them as crazy genius, so the US National Science Foundation has financed their idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, construction, conception and extremely much hard work they built the detector LIGO: the laser Interferometer- gravitational-wave-observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the following time, the precision of LIGO could considerably increase what the recognition performance increased enormously.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore, it is called Advanced LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015 LIGO was started for a final test run to clarify some smaller, stubborn problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On 14 September 2015, only a few days after the commissioning of the detector, the gravitational-waves of the two colliating black holes are through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell of my todill father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically that were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All that I had worked, is no longer science-Fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicrankshafts made of black holes and their through observatories like LIGO measurable signals. but what are gravitational-waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a scraporation in the fabric of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">During the temporary the wave, the space and its entire content is stretched into a direction and into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">For illustration lead lecturers in courses to relativity-theory often plays a proper dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and drafts, stretching and knobs."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational-waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On 14 September, for example, each of us was stretched on the waves of the waves and stretched out. the stretching of an average person was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">This means that 20 zeros after the comma, followed by a 1 Therefore, one declared the LIGO-employee for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five kilometres long laser detector, and that's already absurd, this length would have to be measured on less than a thousandel of the radius of nuclear power. that's grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classical text about gravity</seg>
<seg id="502">Described Kip Thorne, a co-founder, hunting for the waves as follows: "the technical difficulties in the construction of such detectors are extensive.</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "but physicists are angry and with the support of the public, certainly all obstacles will be overcome." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to LIGO. Scott affirms that LIGO is more a ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than the things around us: facial extracts, the size of your cell phones.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical, because you can customize a picture or a map of things by taking the light around you from several points.</seg>
<seg id="509">When killing is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible tones have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">That's why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things which means you particularly much:</seg>
<seg id="512">The face of your child.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead we listen to certain properties like clay and pitch, rhythm and volume, to close the history behind it.</seg>
<seg id="514">"now speaks just Alice."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob she breaks."</seg>
<seg id="516">"dummer Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same goes for gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">With them we can not make simple pictures of objects in all.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by paying attention to changes in amplitude and frequency of waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least lie for LIGO the measured frequencies in the audible area.</seg>
<seg id="521">So if we convert wavepattern in scall, we can hear the universe literally.</seg>
<seg id="522">The gravity to listen, can tell us about the collision of two black holes, which my colleague Scott has already been busy for a very long time.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, not rotating holes, circlash simple: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Turning the two bodies very fast, you hear the same circlash with an additional sound change. this sounds like this: Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement-literal, shaped into the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on 14 September 2015 -- a date, which at least I never forget -- listening LIGO: [Surrenal sound] Jemini, who knows what he must listen, this is as sound of -- SH:... two black holes each with 30-fold sun mass, which is about as fast as the rods of your mixer.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: we are considering what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the dense body in space, one with a mass of 29 sones, the other with a mass of 36 different, revolve around one hundred times a second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know about it because we heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the permanent meaning of LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="533">LIGO is a completely new way to explore the Alls as it has never been possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this path we can listen to the universe and listen to the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in space we can -- virtually or basically -- not see.</seg>
<seg id="536">A super-nova, for example. I would like to know why masonry stars in Supernovae explode.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. of them we have learned a lot about space.</seg>
<seg id="538">The exciting physical procedures happen but in the core that lies behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never pass through, since this opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational-waves permeating iron, as if it would be more transparent glass. the urine would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it because the judgment is covered by its own flashes.</seg>
<seg id="541">Using gravitational-waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important thing: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen before we have never seen before, and of which we do not have any idea. things that we only discover when we listen.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, LIGO found right in the first attempt of things that we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO project, says to this topic: me: the kind of stars that produce black holes are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies from prehistoric times. the black holes are the Saurierknochen for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">LIGO allows us to have a completely different perspective on the events in space, on the origin of the stars and finally also on how we went out of this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now consists of being as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to LIGO we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and circulation of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories - a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and all.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than to listen to the urine?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Do you dream with us.</seg>

<seg id="556">No matter if it made me nervous, me in unpleasant situations, I forced me to say "Yes."</seg>

<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to start with the swing?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: just what to do, I feared to rectify my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear, speeches to keep my social fear -- Puff, weg.</seg>

<seg id="566">"yes" has changed my life.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a definite yes that changed my life to an unexpectedly. it started with a question of my youngest.</seg>

<seg id="574">A new attitude in my family. from there I swam to play with them whenever you ask me. no matter what I just do, or where I go, I say always Yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I am not perfect, but I am unsettled me.</seg>

<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am author. I think things from, wears you to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dreamjob.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dreamjob.</seg>
<seg id="584">I Creire TV. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I do TV, in great style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season, I am responsible for spending 70 hours of program in the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each shipment has hundreds of jobs, which did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode all nine days times four shows, so all nine days 20 million dollars TV, three broadcasts, 20 episodes: scandal, 15 episodes: know To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours of television,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my TV ies run on Thursday on Thursday night.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world, my series are running in 256 languages in 67 languages for 30 million people.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broadcasts that I have created himself, and not only produced, so still obendlessly. I have to find time, really silent, creative time to gather my fans around campfire and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four television series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfire that burn around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who is doing this?</seg>
<seg id="598">Nobody, that's why I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dreamjob.</seg>
<seg id="600">I would not like to impress you.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it because I know what you think when the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">I say to you, so that all of you who work so hard if you're talking about a company, a country or a classroom to take me seriously if I'm talking about work so that I don't only understand on the computer and fantasiere, and it's true if I say, I understand that it is not dreaming at a dreamjob.</seg>
<seg id="603">It's all a job, all work, all reality, everything blood, everything sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I'm working much, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I am deepened in the work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country from nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is, when I set troops up, when I turned up on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">As well you have a high tone, leaving a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">It feels like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all this at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanical, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and disruptive, clinically and motherly, cruel and rational. and the best thing about it is sums.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me if the work is running well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A money begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the money sounds like a animated street, I could drive forever on her.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people take their money if I'm writing to them that I'm writing writing that writing me joy.</seg>
<seg id="616">Understand me not wrong, this does it.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the money -- when I began to work and work with television production when I began to work and work, build, creating and working together, I discovered this cause, this money, this energy. the money!</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The money is action and activity. the money is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The money is music. the money is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The money is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a money, then you can not strive differently from the size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling, not otherwise to be compared to size, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Maybe it is called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Maybe it is called ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I do not know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I know only that I am not for failure, and I just know that I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to tell you, I am a Titan, and I know that I don't want to ask for it.</seg>
<seg id="632">To put one clearly: the more successful I will, the more there are more overflowing borders, the more work there, the more things at the same time, the more watch me, the more I write history, the more expectations there are.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to succeed, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what do I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, not true?</seg>
<seg id="636">The country, which I create, the marathon, whom I cycle, the army, the high tone, the sums, the money, the money.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sums. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the sums.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only that money?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then it stops the money.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revised, overlaid, exaggerated, hidden.</seg>
<seg id="642">The money stops.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mama is a single division of work.</seg>
<seg id="644">"" "Harper tells people:" "" "my mom will not be there, but you can write my Nanny." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="645">And Emerald says: "kittens, I want to go to Shonda Land."</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of an Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">You are baby-Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the money stopped.</seg>
<seg id="649">The sums of the engine was reversed.</seg>
<seg id="650">I don't loved my job anymore. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums came not back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My money was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I made the same things as always: the same Titans work, 15 hours days, worked out, no repentance, don't delegate, a titanium is not, there is not, with all-heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no money.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me there was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a show-Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was gray, I just had no more fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the money and the money I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what makes you doing if what you do, the work you love, suddenly fade?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "I know some may think:" "" "hal thee out, stupid by the author-Titan." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know, you do it, you are doing, you love to be a teacher to be a teacher to be a teacher, a painter, Bill Gates, and knows how to stop the money if you stop the money, when the money stops, who is you then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">If the song of my heart stops, I can survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "South-states waitress presents me a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I am on the way outside," "" "late" "" "and she says," Mama, "" "" Do you play? "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="673">And I will already say NO, when two things are aware of:</seg>
<seg id="674">First, I have to say Yes to everything and secondly, they did not call me "" "" kittens. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="675">"" "it does not call anyone more" "" "kittens." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="676">When is that happened?</seg>
<seg id="677">"" "" "" "I miss it when I am Titan and my money laundered, and here all changes my own eyes." ""</seg>
<seg id="678">And so she says, "Mama," Do you play? "</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say, "yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">It is nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play and her sisters encounter, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book "Everybody Poops."</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing unusual.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding, because my pain and my panic, in loneliness and in the lack of the land, I cannot do anything except suit.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am silent.</seg>
<seg id="686">The country, which I create, the marathon, whom I cycle, the army, the high tone - they no longer exist.</seg>
<seg id="687">Everything that exists is sticky finger and humid kisses, delicate voices, wax stipencils and the song in which it seems to release, or whatever the girl in "The Ice Queen."</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so close that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathed.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me is dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes up and an energy club comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that is not immediately, but it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The money slowly comes back.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, hardly there, it is quiet, hardly audible, but it is there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the sums, but a money.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I would know a magical secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that is all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something that we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The money, the working environment, the Titanic sum, this is just the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, when I am I tell you who I am, when I describe myself with broadcasts and TV hours and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real money is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The money is no power and it is not work-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It is dependent on the pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sums is dependent on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The money is the river which comes from the lust of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real sums is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real sums were ignored the pressure of history, the expectation of the tasks, the expectation and the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sums is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real money is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps my God whispered the wrong words, for which God told me that I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a bit more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say Yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I do this at a fixed rule, so that I can free myself as a workaholic from any debt.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no other choice. I have no choice if I want to hear the money again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so simple. I am not good in games, I like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Play not to me as well as working.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth does hurt,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work, because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer at the workplace as at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This entry is painful, because what a person prefer to be than to house?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">"" "honest, I call myself" "" "Titan" "" -- "" ""</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">We were fast in the garden, before and back, back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We crush soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">I feel predominantly stiff, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always ask for my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the money of the universe meets me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why have we ever stopped with the game?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also do it! let them always say Yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you keep me for naive, for a dreamer.</seg>
<seg id="742">There you will probably be right, but you can also do it!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? you are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play at most 15 minutes with me until they washed out that they want to do something else.</seg>
<seg id="748">It is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a Marienkle or Keks replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">And he speaketh my teenage daughter for a whole 15 minutes with me, I am the mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">There are only 15 minutes, more requires it.</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can put 15 minutes a piece, even on a bad mood day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes a piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile phone, no clothes, no distraction.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the kids entertained.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are drunken!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my charity, my world. it does not have to be the children. it is true to feel the money to have a place for his soul peace.</seg>
<seg id="758">It is not about playing with your own children. it is about joy,</seg>
<seg id="759">About the "Play" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you do well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out it and keep it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="763">I'm not perfect in it. I donate and I siege. friends meet, books to enjoy the day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"" "" "" "do you want to play?" "" "just for everything I have given up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in training when I wanted to exceed myself more and more." ""</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes a piece, why not get there for a full 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can it be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The money came back in my spare time. the money seems to return if I am not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working not without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office. I listen to new ideas, it fills me and my soul. I fortify myself to new ideas. I use it in full attention and love my work again.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the money, but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I do not need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the money, the money is not me... not more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap bubbles and sticky finger, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my money.</seg>
<seg id="775">The sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sums of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The money of labor is part of me, but just a part. and I am so grateful.</seg>
<seg id="778">It is snowed that I am a Titan. I have never seen a Titan, the trip to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said Yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still functional. my campfire still burn.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the happier I and my children.</seg>

<seg id="795">Thanks beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am neurosurgical.</seg>
<seg id="797">As most of my colleagues I have to do with human tragedies every day.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how to change your life from one second to another, after a serious stroke, or after an automobile accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgery it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low capacity to self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a severe violation of the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, heavy disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">That is probably the reason why I was surgical neurosurgical procedure.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="804">Surely they have heard of one of the most known, the "low-stags" stimulation. "in doing so, one could implore a electrode deeply in the brain, in order to influence the circuit circles of the neurons that neurological functions have been improved.</seg>
<seg id="805">It truly is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson, which suffered from severe lemon and heavy pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">But Neuromodulation does not mean Neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeon is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to us.</seg>
<seg id="810">With a little help, the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was leading Oberphysician and worked day and night in the emergency.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I catered patients with skull-stag-trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">You need to imagine that at skull-stag-traumata, the brain reveals and the skull pressure is increasing.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save life, one has to diminish the skull pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">There is sometimes a part of a swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, the brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">The cells of a tissue loss grow to be comparable with very small children that are out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You need to find the proper diet, temperature, moisture and the environment to flourish it.</seg>
<seg id="823">This is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts it made Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw it under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">It was a great surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells that are surrounded by small, unmature cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you still know from the biologieLessons that stem cells are unripe cells that can transform itself into any cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small incline of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to receive this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells held different.</seg>
<seg id="835">They slowly spread out and after a couple of weeks she died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like stem cells, but looked differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand where they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells hot Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">You make 4% of our grandmaster cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">You play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of the foetus, they ensure the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay with us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they take part in the healing of the brain because we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">This is not so safe.</seg>
<seg id="848">But one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cellular source, allowing the brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">This was what we had to prove.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to take a piece of brainmass from the non-language area, and then the cells are exactly as cultivated as it did Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="853">And they then highlight colored, in order to be able to follow them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step we have plagued them to the recording of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologist Transplantation -- Autotrantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we plagued these cells in normal brain tissue tissue? and what will happen if we plagued the same cells in slate braintissue samples?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we could work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario, we plagued the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that they were completely torn down after a few weeks, they would go back home. the room is already occupied, they will not be used there, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario, we put an injury to and rasped exactly the same cells, and now the cells were preserved -- they washed up to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you can see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were plagued.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence they show are these small points. these are the cells that we caught in vitro, in the culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Here we could not stop.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain lesion?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we draw monkey with a manual skill task.</seg>
<seg id="866">You had to take a feed pellets from a tablet.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made them very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they reached a stable skill level, we made the handmotoric range in the motoric cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">Then, the monkeys were paralyzed, they could no longer move their hand.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen to people, they spontaneously recover up to a certain degree, just like after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">The patients are paralyzed and then try to recuperate with the help of plastique brain mechanisms. you are recuperate to a certain degree, just as with the monkey.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were certain that the monkey has reached its degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left side you can see the monkey that spontaneously recovered.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance from injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">He is not as precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">See now when we were plagued the cells: the same monkey, two months after the maturity.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that was also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and later use it.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use it in other neurological models, for example at Parkinson.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implanting them in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope I can show you soon as the human brain gives the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, this is wonderful, I am sure that straight now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think: "I know someone who need it."</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials at the human race.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results you have to fill about two kilograms papers and forms to go through this kind of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and a very professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: take a look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start the clinical studies. if you continue to look into the future how many years it will take until someone can come to hospital and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: this is difficult to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the approval of the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it allow us to start the authority to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to select patients to perform and evaluate treatments if it is useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">Then you have to apply this to a multi-centric study.</seg>
<seg id="897">You really need to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment at any time.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you have told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider it as natural.</seg>
<seg id="903">We do not see democracy as the fragile plant that is in reality, but as a inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider it as unchanging gevity.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his big descendant in Beijing have undoubtedly proved that it is quite possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">Indeed, democracy comes with us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was clear to me as finance minister in the Eurogroup, that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- not likely to affect austerity programs that were realized in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At this moment I thought there might be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my sincere friends told me that democracy would be abolished if it would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for genuine democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup of a mistake, we could save ourselves the democracy but that we need a true and defective democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">Because without democracy our societies are mastered, our future bleak and our great, new technologies are wasted.</seg>
<seg id="914">On the topic of waste, I would like to refer you to an interesting contradiction, which is currently under threat to our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">"" "I call it the" "" "twin Summit" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known to you. they know and recognize him as the Schuldenberg who casts its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the Schuldenberg,</seg>
<seg id="918">But few of them realize his Gemini-type.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which is to be anxious, but they are too anxious to invest there where it would be productive and incomes to produce, with which one could produce the schoolberg and also produce all the things that humanity urgently needed, for example "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">In the past 3 months in the United States, in England and in the Eurozone, 3,4 trillion dollars invested in all the wealth of goods such as industrial plants, machinery, office building, schools, streets, tracks, equipment and so on and so forth.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 trillion US dollars sounds like a lot of money, until one compares with the 5,1 trillion dollars that have been rought the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing to do except the stock exchanges and the real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus, debt and inproductive capital form the twin summit, which is not the same due to the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result are stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54 years old in the US, Japan and Europe, and therefore a low overall economic demand that could not invest in which they do not invest. just like oedipus father, which could not be true in which they would not invest. just like oils, the prophecy of the ovens could be true that his son would kill him if he will grow,</seg>
<seg id="925">Unseasoned the circumstances caused, which lead to that odipus kill him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my haste with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">Its exceedderous art. all the unproductive capital should be used to develop our lives, to develop human talents and to finance all the technologies, "green" technologies that are crucial for the salvation of the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I already think. but before we continue: what do we understand by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle-defined democracy as the social form, in which the Free and the poor control the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy closed naturally too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, aliens, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be an error, the significance of the athic democracy due to these inclusions.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decisive factor in the Athenian democracy was and is that it gave to the working poor, and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but more importantly, and crucial that they can give them the right to political co-determination with equal moods in questions of state power.</seg>
<seg id="935">The athic democracy has not kept a long time --</seg>
<seg id="936">As a candle, which shines very light, it is also fast hidden.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our present-liberal democracies do not have its roots in the ancient Athens.</seg>
<seg id="938">But at the Magna Carta, in the Glorious Revolution of 1688, even in the American Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the athic democracy focused on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for ruling class.</seg>
<seg id="940">"" "" "" "for the liberal democracy was only possible when a full separation of politics and economy is possible and the democratic process was bordered on policy, while the economy was the world of corporations -- a democratic" "" "democratic zone" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="941">In our contemporary democracies, since the time that this separation of politics and economics began, a relentless struggle between the two by the economy gradually immigrated to politics and escaped them.</seg>
<seg id="942">Wonder why the politicians are no longer as they are earlier?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not on a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because that one cannot be in the government today, and still not in power, because the power is interviewed from politics into the economy and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my haste with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is in about as a herd of robbering that sustainably the animals, of which they nourished, deceiving that they are starving at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">Similarly, it is similar to the economy that has become the politics so far ahead. the power of corporations grows, political goods are devaluated to increase inequality, the overall economic demand and the managing director of corporations are too frightened to invest the cash of their business.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful the capitalism has expels the "Demos" [the people] out of democracy, the higher the twin summit, and the greater the wastage of human labour power and the welfare of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="949">"" "if this is true, it is obvious that we have to bring the policy and the economy again, and it would be better when the" "" "Demos" "" "control it, as in the ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners." ""</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea already 100 years ago and it didn't flow well.</seg>
<seg id="952">The doctrine from the Debakel of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can recover only by a wonder like in the ancient Athens without creating new species of brutality and extravagance.</seg>
<seg id="953">"" "but there is a solution: the working poor!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing Niedriglohny through automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, as long as economy and politics are separate areas, the automation can be higher, the duplication, and social conflicts lower, like it -- already very soon as I think -- in countries like China will come.</seg>
<seg id="956">"" "" "" "we need to shape the economy and reunite the business areas of economy and politics, and ensure that we do the reunited area, otherwise we end in a pathological surveillance system that will appear the film" "" "matrix" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="957">The question is not whether capitalism has the technical achievements which he has brought forth, will survive --</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether capitalism is "solved by a dyster, similar to the" star Trek "in which machines are serving the human beings, and people put their energy into the research of the universe, or into a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians" Agora, "in long talks the meaning of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I believe we may be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what do so, how could it look like this "Star Trek" like utopia instead of the "matrix" -similar corystia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In the practical implementation I would like to give you a few examples soon.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the field of companies: ask yourself a capital market where you earn money while you work and where your capital will help you from a job to next, from a company to the next, and the company -- no matter in which one is currently working -- is property of those who work in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income derives from capital and from exhaustion and the concept of wage labor is completely obsolete.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between those who belong to the companies, but are not working in it, and employees who work there, but no docking more between capital and labour, no big gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no contemporal teness summit.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the field of global political economy, please note that our national currencies would have a free sweating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which is issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest threshold], in the interests of all of mankind.</seg>
<seg id="966">Continue to be traded that the entire world trade is traded in that currency -- we call it "the cosmos," in units of "cosmos" -- and every government pays the sum which corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade surplus from the respective country into a common fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund is investing in "green" technologies, particularly in parts of the world in which investment funds are raved.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes had proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today, we have it, especially against the background of a reunified policy and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world that I describe, is at the same time liberated, in which it is privileged persons preferred, and Marxist since it is buried the separation of capital and labour in the dustbin of history, and keynesianically, globally keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all, it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we awaken into such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "matrix" - similar admittent?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we work together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands, and we do it better democratically.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself in your biography itself as libertarian Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if something of what I have just said, then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for reunification of politics and economy is... do we do that, technological development will generate a massive decline in economic demand, which larry Summer is called "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">By transferring this crisis from a part of Earth to the next, as we do it today, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberalism is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is accurate, Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Likewise, as Hayek, I am a libertary Marxist, and like Keynes, and therefore I am also perfect.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: actually, and now we are at ease too.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you are not wirr, you do not think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein, who said this. BG: in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you have said very clearly what you keep from the perspective of the West on China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Do you want to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies, we have the semblance of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my presentation, we have limited democracy to politics while the area, where most of the economy plays -- the area of economy -- a whole-democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In some ways, if I must say so provocative, China today resembles the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">Because -- do you remember -- we tend to connect liberalism to democracy -- this is an error, historically considered.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberal, like John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly skeptical of what the democratic development concerns.</seg>
<seg id="998">What we can observe now in China resembles the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">"" "" "" "China now has to propose to do what the West has done in the 19th century, smells of violent to hypocrisy." ""</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I'm sure that many hearers are curious to your experiences as Minister of Finance at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I reckoned that that comes.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later on the first half-year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing, because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">Namely, let us say goodbye to the self-sufficiency, and the continuous denial that a massive displaced line through the Eurozone continues, and continues to massively increase the development of the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1007">"" "" "" "we had the opportunity to be on the basis of the Greek proposal -- by the way, the first proposal was, which revealed this denial --" ""</seg>
<seg id="1008">"" "" "" "unfortunately it is right to do. unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the European group, continues to deny the denial." ""</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If you are trying a business system, which is not viable, through political will and authoritarianism in life, it will perhaps delay a while, but if then the change occurs, it happens abrupt and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you see ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future if we do not change their construction.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: do you have any mistakes in your time as finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- seriously...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a finance minister, or any minister who claims after 6 months in office, particularly in such a tense situation, he made no mistake, then this is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest error was to sign the request for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February.</seg>

<seg id="1021">But this did not exist.</seg>

<seg id="1038">By Roy Price most of you have never heard, although he is probably responsible for 22-sized minutes of your life on 19th April 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is a leading at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV-production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"" "he is 47 years old, slim, has a Igeland and describes himself on Twitter as" "" "movies, TV, Technology, Tacos." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for it, shows the shows and the content to produce the Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course this is a very hard-fought industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy did not choose any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He has to find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he has to find shows that are right on this curve.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the rating distribution of over 2500 TV series on the IMDb website. the rating continues from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows get this review.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Your show will be rated at nine and higher, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows how "Breaking Bad," "The Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the shows that make addictive, where, after having a season, your brain asks, "where are there any more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This type of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"" "on the left side, here at this end, shows how" "" "Toddlers and Tiaras" "" "-- -- this should tell you enough what is going on at the end of the curve." ""</seg>
<seg id="1055">"" "Roy Price does not take care of being on the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to offer" "" "Toddlers and Tiaras." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1056">He is more thinking about the mean exploiting, the average television -- the shows, which are neither good nor bad, they simply do not inspire.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure that he really is on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is present, and of course it is the first time that Amazon does something, that's why Roy Price do not risk anything.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs a guaranteed success, so it keeps a contest.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online, where they can look at everyone free of charge.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon's free stuff out there, one finds it right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of spectators have a look at these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However they don't know that they will be observed when looking at this shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are observed by Roy and his team who absorb everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You grasp when you start the show when you pause, which parts you skips or re-looking.</seg>
<seg id="1067">You collect millions of data to decide with these data, which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">In fact, they gather the data, process and this results in the answer, and this is: "Amazon should make a Sitcom over four republican networks."</seg>
<seg id="1069">You made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"" "yes," "" "Alpha House" "", "but it seems that many people can remember this show because it was not so good." ""</seg>
<seg id="1072">It is only an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- since the average of this curve is 7,4 and Alpha House is in 7.5 -- i.e. something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About at the same time at another company, another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. just like Roy, he is always looking to find this a Super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it something different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of holding a contest, he and his team got the available data on the Netflix audience, so the reviews they give the shows, their course, which shows they like etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience: what shows they like, which producers, which actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together, they entered a wagon and decided not to make a Sitcom over four senators, but a drama series about a Senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix has led to a hit, at least for the first two relays.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9,1 review on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course the question is: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">You have two very competitive, data sealed companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect them with each other and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow states that this should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If one collects millions of data, for a decision that you meet, then one should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized by very powerful computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The minus what you can expect is good TV, or?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis does not work, then this is something frightening because we live in a time where we can hold more and more statistics to make serious decisions far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does someone here know the company multi-health system?</seg>
<seg id="1091">Nobody. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that nobody in this room will ever get in touch with this software. come in touch with it, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in prison here in the US and ask for release, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a missal is made or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like at Amazon and Netflix. but instead of decide whether a show is good or bad, will be decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate television, 22 minutes, this can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results generated. this is not that a company like multi-health system does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Also, the data sealed companies are wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">2009 gave Google known that they can say through data analysis outbreaks of flu, the limest way -- through data analysis of Google research.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news of news. the success poisoned in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked properly, year round year, until it suddenly worked out more,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It simply does not work, this was again a sensation, including the revocation of the publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data diversification companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all these errors, data streams in decisions of life -- in the workplace, in the legal composition, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data are helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">Also I know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very clever people unimaginable many data to make serious decisions as the decision for cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a medicine. over the years I have recognized some samples about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">Have you ever solve a complex problem, do mainly do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">As a first break, this problem appears in its parts, so that you can analyze the items; as a result, you put the items back together to put a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you need to do this several times, but there are always two things: apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerfully, can only help create a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for this and we all possess it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something that the brain is good, it is parts and pieces recompose, even if the information is incomplete in order to take a good decision - especially when it is the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Therefore, I think, Netflix was so successful because they have data and mind, where they are also included in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience, why they otherwise would not have been capable of. but the decision on how to take all of these parts again, put together a show like "House of Cards" that's not in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant that they entered a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon on the other hand did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">You used to control all their choices, first as they chose TV-ideas, then when they chose "Alpha House" as a Show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a safe decision because they could always say:" "" "they tell us the data." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired outcome.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data is helpful for better decisions, but I believe things go wrong when data are starting to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerfully they are, data are just a tool and not to forget that this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will be...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"" "it is also called" Magic 8 Ball "" "." it is amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or no-question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer. "" "" most likely "" "" -- exactly here at this moment. "" "</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will see it later with a technology demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">"" "" "" "I have previously made some decisions in my life, whereby I should listen to the ball in retrospect." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace it with something much broader than data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">That is perhaps the ball clush and clever and clever. ultimately, it is up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right corner.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I find this as a very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data still pays out to make decisions, an expert in what you do, and risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because in the end it is not the data, but the risks that you end at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thanks beautiful.</seg>
