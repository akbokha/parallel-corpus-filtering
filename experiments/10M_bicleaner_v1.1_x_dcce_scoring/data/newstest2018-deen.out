Munich 18@@ 56 : four maps that change your view of the city
an Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt where young people are to meet today .
a Gru@@ ft@@ chapel , where now is used for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small gar@@ den@@ er manage the one @-@ old reason for farmers .
the oldest official map of Mün@@ ch promotes exciting stories about days .
it is more nervous when maps are not currently up @-@ to @-@ date .
that knows everyone who had to go exciting because the car @-@ Nav@@ i instead of a circum@@ vent street showed a green meadow .
the historical maps of the digital Bavaria At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as of the state government , are all other than currently - but it is very enligh@@ tening .
especially when you compare them with current online cards .
then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the area @-@ area of the Mün@@ chner Mercury in the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria at@@ las is a spl@@ attered canvas that one does not recognise as such .
into the large over@@ sight @-@ map , for cities and municipalities were more detailed cards , so @-@ called Ur@@ posi@@ tions@@ blades .
this arose according to the specifications of the Bay@@ erische Staats@@ measuring management between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and originates from the first understanding of Bavaria .
your Customer : Napoleon .
the French He@@ er@@ es@@ leader occupied Bavaria since the spring 1800 during the Second World War of War with Austria .
Napoleon had an overview of the occupied country and gave an top@@ o@@ graphical recording of Bavaria in order - of course for military purposes .
even if the French troops moved to the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville , from 9 February 18@@ 01 , there were today &apos;s neighbours that created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria map .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV . Joseph continued the project in advance , founded the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ o@@ graphical Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and thus the Bay@@ erische Staats@@ measuring management . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ur@@ posi@@ tions@@ blatt for Munich dates from the year 18@@ 56 and is like all the others on the website of the Bay@@ erische Staats@@ bibliothek .
the comparison early morning / Today is most impressive at the example of the provincial capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
one example of this is subj@@ ection , which appears in the map of 18@@ 56 yet relatively isolated .
S@@ end@@ ling was introduced 21 years after the creation of the map , so 1877 , as a district of Munich .
today there is shelter in the middle of the city .
the houses under@@ lining around 18@@ 56 along the today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße which was named in 1878 to Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader of the insurrection of the Bav@@ arian peasants against Austria 17@@ 05 .
where today the West park is , you can see nothing as fields - at first glance : when hin@@ ge appears a small @-@ dis@@ advant@@ aged card with do@@ zens of lines and numbers : hand@@ written fl@@ ur@@ ns from the so @-@ called &quot; certificate , &quot; from which the basic tax was derived .
small plots there are no farmers no longer - but a small res@@ ser of the complex in the sun . &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ s@@ end@@ ling .
the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 scene of the Oktober@@ fest , was in the 19th century actually a meadow - and not a concrete desert .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the Ur@@ posi@@ tions@@ blatt , one reads in the area of the current district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen not just the street name &quot; at the Gast@@ ei@@ g &quot; or from the jet@@ ty , &quot; but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot;
yes , here at the au@@ er@@ field street , one once pic@@ ks people with mad@@ ness .
there was 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt founded in 18@@ 58 / 59 .
from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von G@@ ud@@ der introduced the establishment - that psychiat@@ rist , who is associated with the death of King Ludwi@@ gs II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and ended for example the Ank@@ ettes of the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also has allowed the personnel to apply violence against the in@@ mates , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , Head of the Museum of Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who has worked for an exhibition with the Anst@@ alt .
for 280 patients the first place was first , later it was extended to 500 places .
sometime this capacity is no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreis@@ er@@ ren@@ anstalt in the hair of 1905 .
since 2006 the Is@@ ar @-@ A@@ MP@@ ER @-@ Klin@@ ik@@ um is located in Munich @-@ East , one of the largest psychiat@@ rists in Germany .
at the A@@ real of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt you can meet young people in the Mün@@ chner Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um .
the Order acquired the building complex 1920 and walked him into a youth @-@ home with training .
located in the west , the football field of the TS@@ V Munich East , east of residential buildings from the 1980s .
in 2015 we set the kids @-@ house &quot; Casa Don Bosco &quot; - in architectural approach to the origin of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt who had been destroyed during the Second World War in bombar@@ d@@ ment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was at 18@@ 56 as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Head Square &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Kauf@@ ing@@ er@@ straße called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Buy alley . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a decisive change brought the Second World War also in the heart of Munich .
the bom@@ bs of the Al@@ lies in December 1944 a lot of holes in the city center .
a big one remained until today - at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
the English Institute , small business@@ men and a Gru@@ ft@@ chapel of the Middle Ages were once at the Mari@@ en@@ hof , where these days work the pre @-@ bite and take place on 5 April 2017 for the second S @-@ Bahn route .
with the sli@@ der , the old Munich card can be compared with the a@@ erial view of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
civil rights group published tour guide for Mis@@ souri
the National association for the advancement of colored colored has issued a warning for coloured people who are travelling to Mis@@ souri because of the discri@@ min@@ atory policy and the rac@@ ist attacks of the State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory Board is to enter into force until 28 August 2017 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sou@@ ri@@ ans , while travelling through the state can take special attention and be seen in recent times throughout the country and here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is stated in the statement of the group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a recently adopted law of Mis@@ souri , which makes it harder to win discrimination , as well as the prosecution authorities of the state , dis@@ proportionate to minorities , prompted the group to release the journey , the NA@@ AC@@ P said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have violations of civil rights that people happen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they will hold them because of their skin colour , they are collap@@ sed or killed , &quot; said the President of Mis@@ souri NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not yet heard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the United States .
the group cited like rac@@ ist distor@@ tions against black students at the University of Mis@@ souri and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from T@@ ennes@@ see .
S@@ anders died at the beginning of the year after he had no gasoline anymore during the journey and was taken into custody by the police of Mis@@ souri in custody without a crime .
the Council also shows a recent report by the Office of the General State of Mis@@ souri , which is shown in the state 75 per cent more frequently than wheat .
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware of and their families , friends and staff informed about what could happen in Mis@@ souri , &quot; said Chapel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people need to be ready if there are chew@@ ing money or the relatives know they are travelling through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ souri was reported in 2015 100 Hass@@ le @-@ breaking news , according to the latest figures from the hate @-@ breaking reporting programme of the F@@ BI , which are the state in relation to the number of such violations in the 16th rank of the country .
the travel warning is also a response to a new Mis@@ souri law which would make it more difficult , a company because of housing or employment discrimination .
previously the American Civil War Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) travel warnings for Texas and Arizona , published after the states of immigration authorities to commit local prosecution authorities to ban people due to immigration rules , which will contribute to further edges of the AC@@ L@@ U .
travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries , but in recent times stakeholders the measure have been used as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States .
past@@ ure project is elementary
the fisher@@ bacher Wei@@ de@@ j@@ n project is a success project and is continued next year .
the CD@@ U @-@ Bundestag Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac have shown a picture on the spot .
at the right grab@@ en@@ hof of the family Schwen@@ dem@@ ann the representatives of the fisher@@ man CD@@ U local network met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MPs .
Markus Schwen@@ dem@@ ann granted first insight into his farm , in which he managed to 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 mam@@ mal and also hosts many young animals and hosts five apartments in five apartments .
the &quot; Black Forest &quot; is for him the alternate mark@@ eter for the milk of his cows , so swi@@ vel @-@ dem@@ ann .
at the table of the holiday guests only Regi@@ on@@ ales can be found .
since he is also called B@@ L@@ H@@ V @-@ Chairman of the fisher@@ man , he is very important to the ordination of the Weimar project as &quot; elem@@ ent@@ ar . &quot;
I can do not build on such a steep surface .
the green space for a lot of work , much must be processed with the motor S@@ ense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have here to fight with the conditions and with the Top@@ o@@ graphy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphas@@ ised &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 he took over the el@@ ong@@ ated operation and un@@ parall@@ eled this without chemical plant protection and fertilizers , even if he does not lead a bio@@ operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commun@@ e has recognised the importance of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; course project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and is happy about the leader of the leader . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the farmers would have to support farmers at the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euro per h@@ ect@@ are .
one hope that the for@@ estation of the surfaces could be pulled out even for quite a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest treasure that we have , are the people working in agriculture and make thoughts on how they continue their operation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers stand for the promotion of often in criticism
in 2013 , a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013 .
the accounting surface is about 40 hectares , which may not be for@@ ested until at least 20@@ 23 .
of the total cost of 71 500 Euros , half of the leader was funded , a quarter carried the village of fishing .
so they share the farmer 12 6@@ 10 euro , who had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of wheat .
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; explained swing .
K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac stressed : &quot; you are doing a really good job , without farmers and rural women do not go . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also for Peter Weiss stood firm : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here are the best food produced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ scape G@@ ail@@ ment ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg enables the state Promotion of Wei@@ de@@ vil@@ s .
the objective is the offensive of the Black Forest .
prerequisite is the presence of one of the L@@ PR @-@ signed conveyor belt .
in addition , the in@@ oc@@ ative surface may not be de@@ cel@@ er@@ able ( Hang@@ ar over 35 percent ) and must be threatened with the for@@ estation of the for@@ estation .
for fishermen &apos;s ordination project , 2018 is currently running the application of eight participants with 24 plots that want to build up to 16 km of Zau@@ n .
the accounting surface is 35 hectares , which are calculated at more than 112 000 Euro .
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tru@@ mp is now taking the Statue of Liberty
the safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to att@@ acking the statues .
the Americans appreciate this as well as any other - therefore the careful overthrow Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos Square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Mill@@ er , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tru@@ mp regime , knew certainly what he did when he took a symbolic battle with Jim A@@ co@@ sta by CN@@ N about the proposals of the president for dr@@ astic restriction of legal migration with the Statue of Liberty .
to remain fair , Mill@@ er does not handle the statue itself .
a horror of the boat owners and Liberty Im@@ it@@ ators would have turned him out if he had done it .
but he laid their significance , and in particular the meaning that you wrote , when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to its base .
when Mill@@ er A@@ co@@ sta compl@@ ained : &quot; I want to go here not to a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that enligh@@ tens the world .
the poem which you refer to that later has been added and not part of the original statue of Liberty . &quot;
Mill@@ er is knowledgeable , but how he formulated it himself , it is not really about history .
it is about the contemporary response to the emerging words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : &quot; yours gu@@ essed , your poor , / your printed masses , that will cra@@ ve to breathe free , / the falling waste of your rich coasts . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time when the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; miserable waste &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was better to see on our screens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mill@@ er was not engaged in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Tru@@ mp@@ s USA .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation : it is indeed a conflict with the importance of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who put themselves in place their words after their death on the base - knew very good that they accomplished a high political action .
the sculpture should show the ties between French and American re@@ public@@ anism by demonstrating the feminine portra@@ yal of freedom in a un@@ used classical portra@@ yal of freedom .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in their poem is the feminine figure no longer abstract - it has received a voice .
and she has a very different name to the mother of the Ex@@ il@@ ants .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist cou@@ p and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just like Lazarus the importance of the statue changed , people from the right wing wanted to change this long time .
the great cry of the Rush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tru@@ mp , argued 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is nobody to load , but rather an early neo @-@ conservative , that the American flame goes into the around the world : &quot; Lady Liberty goes forward .
she is supposed to bear the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch is not to enligh@@ ten the way into the United States . &quot;
quite unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh here on something .
the importance of the statue is entirely and a question of the point of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus consisted in it to see them as they were by the exhaustive but hop@@ eless people after long and often terrible journeys on the de@@ cks of ships was seen .
it is in the tru@@ est sense to see the world from the perspective of people who are looking for refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
her statue says to them the words of hope and welcome they must hear .
and of course this is not the perspective that Mill@@ er and Tru@@ mp would ever want to acknowledge .
her tor@@ ch is not to enligh@@ ten the path , but the hatred , which is its only source of power , ign@@ ite .
world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black lo@@ aves Scottish members of the team from Great Britain
E@@ ili@@ ie Do@@ yle reminds itself of a time when only two vill@@ i had belonged to the team of Great Britain
&quot; &quot; &quot; the power direc@@ tor of the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member cont@@ ingent of the World Championship has a massive contribution to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London 2017 , which starts on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Scotland develops something special &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we welcome it and we are trying to understand it and we will continue until we figure it , &quot; said Black .
&quot; I am talking to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think that it has something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are medals @-@ candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - which will be played against Sir Mo Far@@ ah at the 5.000 m distance while E@@ ili@@ ie Do@@ yle was elected by the crew to the team captain .
&quot; E@@ ili@@ ie is quite modest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their captain speech was incredible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were obli@@ que or wherever they live or exercise , went out of space and felt very proud and were highly motivated .
the passion and the genuine feel that E@@ ili@@ ie was very natural , were great . &quot;
the Commonwealth @-@ Silver medal winner , which is at its fifth World Championships at the 400 @-@ m hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; unbelievable &quot; that 16 banknotes in the British team are .
Scotland &apos;s largest number of athletes at the World Championships was seven , which were achieved in 1983 and 2015 .
the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Mittel@@ stre@@ w Mu@@ ir leads on this path and placed five British and two European records last year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m rounds .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , the 1,500 m is running , is another Scot@@ sman , which you were looking for a great season that was signed to win the victory at the British team Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary Games .
Do@@ yle reminds themselves of their first world Championships as the only other sh@@ ote in Team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ nell was .
the Mann@@ er@@ ts captain says that they are &quot; enormously proud , &quot; on the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots do not only belong to the team , but in some cases also with the medals and with the fin@@ als .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the special thing to be part of this team is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was anyway a great honour , but to know that my team mates have voted for me and chose me , makes it something very special for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; obviously , I am very proud of all those who belong to the team .
it only shows how far we came .
and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes who want to rise on Po@@ dium .
what my speech as a captain concerns ?
yes , I think she went well .
I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to put on these home support and benefit from it that we are back at the Olympiastadion .
I get a second chance to go there and compete , and it will just be such a great atmosphere there . &quot;
blocking of critic@@ isms on Facebook : do not give you a public position when you cannot wear the intru@@ der of voters
the father of our land knew something of bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it didn &apos;t last long until the newspapers smote him because of all , from the internal policy up to its political principles .
he sho@@ cked at the cri@@ tique , safe .
but he did not put his critics at the silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for in 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , fool@@ ish and mu@@ te , we will be led to slaughter as the sheep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that brings me to Maryland to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan , who must work to be more like Washington .
Ho@@ gans associates have blocked the posts of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil War rejected him this week in the beginning of this week .
the rod of the governor caused the law@@ suit as a fri@@ vo@@ l , and the online comment was full of a bac@@ kl@@ ash with &quot; Na , and ? &quot;
&quot; it is only Facebook , &quot; said many people .
but it is important .
and it is especially important if it is a type like ho@@ gan .
this is a Republi@@ can Gover@@ nor in a overwhelming democratic state that is amazing .
he has the two @-@ highest approval of the 50 Govern@@ ors of the nation .
Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary heat head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very sent to exploit Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and to debate his ha@@ un@@ less head after chemotherapy on his side .
therefore , the block@@ age of persons coming to the side of the governor - which is a public forum that is called officially and by employees who are paid by public tax @-@ Dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ ist Spre@@ ader in Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse the actions of the governor and argued that the block@@ age of comments is nothing more than a moderation .
but it is too easy to use the image of tro@@ lling or sp@@ amm@@ ers or water @-@ filled people who sw@@ inging online the whi@@ p .
the post spoke with some of the real people who were blocked by Ho@@ gan .
and these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a pastor , no tro@@ lls .
they all said that their comments respectful , thoughtful and not prof@@ ane were .
the pastor took the Bible in his post and appeals to Ho@@ gans Catholic faith .
At@@ tor@@ ney Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not ugly , but she asked for hate @-@ hate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate @-@ hate and other latest news , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she wrote in the commentary box of the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea when a number of people take position on the same subject , then they are ab@@ used by some rather than a so @-@ called collective action rather than a large group of people concerned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the staff of the Gover@@ nor is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spam attack &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; others would call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inter@@ ce@@ de . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or a negative comment will be deleted .
it is much cleaner than in former times when one had done the same that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical lad@@ ders and to burn prot@@ esters and to swe@@ ar .
but that is exactly what is just digit@@ ally .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public official , which is critici@@ zed to Facebook and other social media .
President Tru@@ mp is lam@@ inated by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question fell last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County was last the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when they named a voters from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Be@@ vin received a visit from AC@@ L@@ U because of its use of Facebook and Twitter .
it should not be so hard .
at the time of Washington , the time of affordable port@@ tos had a similar effect as the internet .
the number of newspapers multiplied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous let@@ tering signs on his leadership .
and even at that time , Washington had anonymous tro@@ lls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the people , the pseud@@ onyms such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that Washington &apos;s decisions made . &quot; &quot; &quot;
petition that critici@@ zed its position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and navigation with Great Britain critici@@ zed his office , according to the historical documents that were collected by the Online Pap@@ ers of George Washington Project .
but he has not brought them to silence .
freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses belong to the basis of our nation .
and true guide means to accept this .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes on domestic comfort at the Renaissance Club
the former Europeans No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope in the next three days on local comfort , as the Renaissance Club in East Lo@@ th@@ ian , the 25 edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , which led last year next door to the Ar@@ cher@@ field Links to the end of the end , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new eye @-@ site and it functions as a tournament ambass@@ ador in the name of the club founder and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance Club was built , and we see how he reaches his fame with this event , &quot; said G@@ ty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the players will see this course from his best side , he is in a great state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jerry has made a great job when he set this place .
he is an ei@@ ving for@@ f@@ ator of this game and is proud of his performance here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a great showcase for this course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Engl@@ ish@@ man is looking forward to uph@@ old a championship for the first time , although he won in his 32 @-@ year career at the European Tour as well as at the European Challenge Tour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels really special , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the player &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open since it was in the year after I won them , out of the program . &quot; &quot; &quot;
back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories of the last year come back and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on , last year here to win .
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate . &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came after his 50@@ th birthday earlier this year at the European Senior Tour , returns to the action at home .
this event will be its first Scottish performance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; said Or@@ r , the man of Hel@@ ens@@ burgh .
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel that additional pressure .
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am glad that it has gone far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the trio in the field , the former Masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and the Senior Major Champions Paul Bro@@ adh@@ ur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ er .

less lung cancer due to passive smoke
in the past two decades fewer people have died because of passive cancer .
for this result , scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) come in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after our estimates a year of 167 lung cancer is attributable to passive smoke , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chief manager Hei@@ ko Be@@ cher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison he moved with his own study on this subject from 1994 .
back then there have been some 400 lung cancer cases because of passive noise per year in Germany .
the new investigation is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
pets are proven to be very complex
&quot; &quot; &quot; construction work in the Vill@@ inger street are in full swing and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lie in the time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the director of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fred Hein@@ ze &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the area of the house connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as in the ground there is a lot of bran@@ ded , which does not notice in the plans .
the traffic , which is repeatedly imp@@ eded the construction works again , represents a big problem for the part of the company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignorance of the mot@@ orists in front of red lights and shut @-@ down is already enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reports Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road is closed and only the buses be eligible for transit .

poverty and death in the Indonesian Gold@@ land
when Bar@@ dina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks the dinner , they don &apos;t use a hob .
it even uses rarely a pot .
in their wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Region of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife usually places a sweet potato - locally as &quot; not@@ a , &quot; - right in the fireplace .
after half an hour the shor@@ ten l@@ ol@@ le is removed with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ seas@@ oned hands and eng@@ ages .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the arm@@ chair - she has no furniture - where she also performs its daily work , e.g. clothes with clou@@ dy water from the nearby sw@@ amp .

poly@@ gam@@ y is custom@@ ary here .
of course , too late can be dangerous : most vill@@ men are unemployed , and many drink heavily , and there are the soldiers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody we@@ ep it , after 17 o &apos;clock in the village &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , recorded in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 El@@ der were supposed to vote in front of the occup@@ ying forces .
an existing movement , which led to the independence against Dutch domination , turned out rapidly against the government of Jakarta , which maintains control of the region and excl@@ u@@ des foreign journalists or legal monitoring .
in 2003 the province was officially divided into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , with the independent part of Pap@@ ua New gu@@ ine@@ as the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as secluded as it is desert . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the car .
there are no public transportation .
the town with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses that are surrounded by bam@@ boo tro@@ mb@@ ones , and from cor@@ ru@@ gated roofs , which were converted by r@@ ust into various yellow shades .
only very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their journey here , consecr@@ ated for journalists and practically no foreigners .
before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , dear Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans a God called U@@ GA Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not used to wear these clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points to their livel@@ i@@ ent , hand@@ crafted tur@@ ban , her dark shirt , and their bright rock . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier we only had leaves on our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pap@@ ua is Indon@@ esi@@ ally poor province , where 28 % of men live under the poverty line and have some of the worst inf@@ ant mortality rates in Asia .
but it is also Indon@@ esi@@ ens Gold@@ land .
the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high @-@ provincial province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
alone in 2015 , Free@@ port has built a value of 3.@@ 1 billion US dollars gold and copper .
in addition Pap@@ ua has wood resources worth valued 78 billion US dollars .
but this wealth , however , are a source of misery for the Pap@@ ua , who make sure that Indon@@ esi@@ al military preser@@ ves a sti@@ cking presence .
an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port local military forces and units paid almost 20 million US dollars , including up to 150@@ ,000 US dollars to a single officer .
Pap@@ u@@ anic demands on larger autonomy are threatened by these golden go@@ ose and will be treated gn@@ ess .
according to activists , more than 500@@ ,000 pap@@ ua have been killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed since 1969 by the Indonesian military , tor@@ tured and det@@ ained .
Mass@@ ah in Pap@@ uas &apos;s stem from 1970 @-@ 1960 , according to the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission , became genocide .
the Indonesian police alone in the region had more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators in the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we value All &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is said in a report by the Arch@@ dioc@@ ese Brisbane from 2016 , in the report on atro@@ cities of the previous year , such as un@@ legal statements and torture - rape and power stops are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal de@@ portation of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s difficult to count the number of victims as every week happen , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia @-@ researcher for Human Rights Watch .
the screws are reinforced since Pap@@ uas may bring resources a influ@@ x of settlers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is about 83 % Christian , but demo@@ graphic development is changing as Muslim economic migrants are from the populated islands Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .

&quot; the migrants have begun to sell chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local pap@@ ua , &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ Local who moved into the provincial capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has the native pap@@ ua - the Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua - her market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Indonesian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , in the Volk@@ sm@@ al and as Jok@@ ow@@ i , spoke to the inequalities and the infrin@@ gements of Pap@@ ua in 2014 .
the former Zimmermann secured 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta .
but in Pap@@ ua has changed little , and today the locals feel che@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for Jok@@ ov@@ i with the expectation that he will fulfil our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says You . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is initiation in October a deep point .
on 7 December 2014 , a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , as two Indonesian soldiers on a motorcycle through the darkness .
the slain children told them that they should turn their head@@ lamp .
one of the soldiers took off their tone and came later with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers , who were drunk , hun@@ ted , and smote the group with their tissues , said victims and witnesses .
then , one of the soldiers moved into the group of children .
a child who was 16 @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so hard to be@@ aten that he fell into coma .
a few hours later , the building was put in the nearby government commission and the things escal@@ ate the next day .
about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered themselves together on a football ground in front of the local police station and the military force center to demand justice .
they bore cerem@@ onial hunting , and led the Wa@@ ita @-@ dance - in the circle continuously and a bir@@ d@@ ang im@@ min@@ ating - from Pap@@ uas Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe before .
some demonstr@@ ators began to drag stones on police and military post .
when the atmosphere was heated , the soldiers was sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses do more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not released in an official document of TI@@ ME that has not been released from the local media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ia Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the dro@@ wn danger and called for rest and urged the crowd to return home .
nobody was listening to the mood in the mood .
&quot; when I turned out , suddenly I was shot in my lin@@ kes wr@@ ist , &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the veranda of his colourful wooden house .
kay@@ ame does not know who has been frozen , but says that the bul@@ let from among the ranks of the soldiers gathered together .
&quot; it was over@@ crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his cous@@ in , the witness of the shooting was .
&quot; I ran@@ ged to him and searched for his body to be sure that he was , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who only bears a name , the TI@@ ME in dark mood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kiss@@ ed him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editor @-@ spec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said Re@@ por@@ ters that his officers wanted to secure their station only &quot; because they are attacked .
&quot; we must defend ourselves when people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner Pud@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 .
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many more in@@ ju@@ red .
the news about the kill@@ ings arrived only the following day &apos; fil@@ tered &apos; to Jakarta .
three weeks wrote Jok@@ ow@@ i in Jay@@ ap@@ ura a passionate speech in which he spoke sympath@@ ies for the families of the victims and sw@@ add@@ ling the historical ab@@ norm@@ alities in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case immediately solved , so it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Safety Minister Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 , that he will condemn a extra@@ judicial mechanism to reduce historical human rights violations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the phrases were almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries have occurred long ago .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and at the beginning of 2000 @-@ he years .
the point is that we have committed ourselves to address these violations , but there are processes that need to go through , &quot; he said .
then we got a retreat when he said on June 5th in Jakarta with TI@@ ME and said he did not establish plans , in Pap@@ ua a complaint mechanism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything is regulated by law &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wir@@ anto , who accused the UN for &quot; crimes against humanity , &quot; said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Pap@@ ua was already attached , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai Vor@@ ole .
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims were against such claims with gri@@ ev@@ ous mis@@ fortune .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes .
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I am afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was afraid to be arrested by the military , I was afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says that he was be@@ aten by the military after he was buried , four of the victims .
&quot; after I buried the corp@@ ses , the military searched for me , &quot; he says .
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police on vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confrontation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma , which refused to bring an unconscious man to hospital , died a person and 17 others were wounded , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was dro@@ w@@ ned in a nearby river died on the way to the hospital .
the native village @-@ inhabitants prot@@ esting prot@@ esting to the location of the company .
the police said that the vill@@ agers were looking at officers , who re@@ acted by war@@ med by war@@ nuts .
but locals say that the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot on the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be re@@ venge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year Dom@@ ing@@ gu B@@ adi@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the latest here is quickly delivered , so the TI@@ ME .
&quot; I hid myself in my house two days . &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called to withdraw the officers of the officers and withdraw the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade of the police from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a lack of trouble for the Indonesian government .
the lack of sensu@@ ous development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the stem cells of Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and Dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua .
many &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Free Pap@@ ua Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the vine army , which claims to defend the rights of Pap@@ ua by b@@ aking it to spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ apping of Indonesian soldiers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in response to this , thousands of people were arrested in Pan@@ i@@ ai over the last few years , under the pretext of safeguarding national sovereignty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some never dive again .
among the people in Pap@@ ua is Pan@@ i@@ ai as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice that is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of reach .
the people here build everything they eat : mainly not@@ a and fruits and leaf vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can handle four or five fields of sweet potato .
they retain the bulk of harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of not@@ ted only 10,000 Indonesian Rup@@ ies ( 75 C@@ ents ) .
over time , economic inequalities between the indigenous Pap@@ ua and new migrants have grown since the opening of new flight routes to the airport of Nab@@ ire in larger numbers have arrived .
the few jobs that exist in the region go usually to the better educated and aff@@ lu@@ ous migrants .
Pap@@ ua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to make their own business competitive .
&quot; young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the Chairman of the Chief Executive Board of Pan@@ i@@ ai .
isolation holds the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
in addition , limitations of reporting international media remain tense .
at the beginning of the year , the French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ es and Basi@@ l Long@@ cham@@ p were ported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the Deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ov@@ is electoral campaign , the limitations of reporting to increase transparency and development , not realised .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new threats to foreign journalists who try to report from Indon@@ esi@@ ens im@@ tranquil provinces of Pap@@ ua and Western pap@@ ua : visa @-@ denial and a black list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited to the immediate neighbors Pap@@ uas .
in March six paci@@ fic states - Ton@@ ga , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Sal@@ om@@ ones Islands - the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; different and widely spread violations &quot; in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have historically been viewed the O@@ PM .
the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Ministry of Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r dis@@ missed the accus@@ ation of the Group and said journalists in Jakarta : &quot; in Indonesia is still a democratic system , and there are free media so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights attacks . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people on site want more foreign governments to take this knowledge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of the human right @-@ ambass@@ ador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura visited her silence and op@@ ted him , &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also attended the session but would remain anonymous .
Indonesia also has another presidential election , but the Pap@@ ua say that they probably will not vote again for Jok@@ ov@@ i .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the Chairman of the Chief Executive Council .
he wants that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from that it lives under the constant threat of a rob@@ ber@@ y military , is located in arms and health services .
Gob@@ i says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai People , like other Pap@@ ua , their voice for Jok@@ ov@@ i as a &quot; guilt , &quot; which he must rep@@ ay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they do not need money , they only want justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the threats and intim@@ id@@ ations , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai jack@@ ets brought a last symbolic act of the Des@@ p@@ ite : the corp@@ se of a sacrifice was buried on a terrain exactly opposite the police and the military station .
they know that they might never give justice to them , but at least they don &apos;t forget those responsible for their crimes .
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with healthy head .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; skyscrapers of Dubai for the second time
a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest residential towers of the world in Dubai to flee its flow @-@ book and forced hundreds of residents , from the 3@@ 37 metres high , 79 @-@ storey building .
it is the second fire that is swe@@ pt in just two years by the high @-@ house , which is called random the Tor@@ ch @-@ Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) .
the building was evacu@@ ated , injury were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we slept with the fire@@ works and in the cry of the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come from the 50@@ th floor to come down , &quot; told a inhabitants whose name was called George ang@@ ab , Re@@ uters .
Dub@@ ais civilian protection authorities said that the units of fire fight against 4.@@ 00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 GMT ) the fire extingu@@ ished and the building cooler .
the government said , they work on providing accommodations for those affected .
the incident may ask questions about the safety of materials , which are used in areas of skyscrapers all over the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch @-@ Building after its fire in 2015 yiel@@ ded that the largest part of the damage caused by the cl@@ adding , the outer cl@@ adding to decoration or isolation .
in Britain , the police said , they believe that the system of plates to insulation and disgu@@ ise on the London Gren@@ fell tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a bran@@ ding in June , in which approximately 80 people died .
no Davis Cup reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International tennis courts ( IT@@ F ) has fallen with its large Davis Cup cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
at the session of Ho Chi Min@@ h City , he was only supported for this sport @-@ revolutionary proposal , Davis Cup single only on two winners , Hau@@ ling thin not supported by the required two @-@ third @-@ majority .
although often very long , but even so very valued five @-@ set classics remain the traditional company so well preserved .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 per cent of the member states voted for reform , the aim of the IT@@ F president David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only barely lacking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision but are disappointed that our members have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of this iconic and historic competitions , &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one will continue to work on improving the competitors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at all , not only for the voting was already the proposal to carry out the final balance on a neutral place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new from 2018 are only compar@@ atively minor details : the fin@@ alists will last in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup in the next round will have the host right next year .
in order to reduce the costs of the organizer , the requirements in terms of training stations , etc . , and players will need to complete less official media dates before the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 US travellers bringing robots into the plane , finds a survey
a survey conducted among passengers act that more than 20 percent are conscious or un@@ consciously neglected articles by the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 per cent , who bore the airplane , while they did not acci@@ dentally damaged kni@@ ves or other items with blade .
less than 1 percent claimed , they would have been delayed , that they have been mist@@ aken with scar@@ ce , am@@ muni@@ tion or explo@@ sives .
the survey on more than 1,000 people - the Strat@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , conducted by a jet Charter , the Strat@@ os Jet Char@@ ger Inc . , has also been fixed that younger travellers are more responsible for the rules .
by the respon@@ dents , the en@@ cor@@ es that they do not know@@ ingly have tried to fly with something that was banned by T@@ SA , were 19.@@ 7 percent Mill@@ enni@@ als , compared with less than 15 percent , the members of the generation X were .
the most common items that have been inten@@ tioned by T@@ SA agents , were foods and liquids .
more than 3 percent gave gifts to unknow@@ ingly borne items with blades by the safety control while 2.2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.@@ 7 percent of the male respon@@ dents also confirmed that they had inten@@ tionally brought drugs to the aircraft .
the company said , there have been travellers in the whole country to find out how many acci@@ dently s@@ mu@@ g@@ gel@@ ware brought by the airport safety and how many it would have done .
it is no surprise that the people , the most popular s@@ mu@@ g@@ gel@@ ware - do not know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - through security , those who were most often flying .
however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are a bit complicated and confusing .
people are often uns@@ ure which liquids they may take and how much of it .
so it is no surprise that the largest amount of objects conf@@ is@@ cated by the T@@ SA are conf@@ is@@ cated objects .
for a while the people , the T@@ SA could see books as a s@@ mu@@ g@@ gel@@ ware .
liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k is no matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la @-@ customers cancel order
&quot; &quot; &quot; electric @-@ thous@@ end@@ s@@ assa El@@ on Mus@@ k will be happy to share with the huge number of pre@@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has hitherto under@@ gone that a part of the customer has withdrawn their non @-@ binding reservation .
in addition to the always tri@@ umph@@ ant figures on sales growth and still gigantic sales aim , Tes@@ la @-@ Chef El@@ on Mus@@ k denoun@@ ced for the first time a different , less gl@@ oss number : the cancellation of the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mus@@ k frequently had applied with the more than 500@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car in recent months , whose delivery has just begun . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now Mus@@ k is a : from the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre@@ orders already 6@@ 3.000 have been withdrawn again .
critics had always pointed out that it is merely a non @-@ binding reservations .
in case of cancellation Tes@@ la pays the 1000 euro ( in the US 1000 US dollars and in Britain 1000 pounds ) &quot; reservation payment &quot; completely returned .
currently , 45@@ ,000 such non @-@ binding reservations made , spatial mus@@ k in a telephone conference with an@@ alysts .
that the cancellation of up to twelve percent of all orders could become a problem , the Tes@@ la leader does not believe .
his argument : the challenge with the ambitious growth target is not in demand , but on the production side .
in the last year Tes@@ la 8@@ 4,000 vehicles delivered .
2018 : all models have to be put together - 500@@ ,000 500@@ ,000 , by 2020 one million .
the demand for this is evident there .
according to Mus@@ k , currently there are 1800 reservations per day .
who is now appointed a &quot; Model 3 &quot; in the second half of 2018 with delivery - when Tes@@ la creates it , his brand @-@ new , never tested in practice tested production lines without major inter@@ rup@@ tions with maximum utilization .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
but if it comes to larger delays , then the un@@ binding of reservations could be a problem for Tes@@ la .
because then the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers in dro@@ ves .
EPA boss P@@ ru@@ itt moves back to reducing emissions from the rules of the Obama Era to reduce emissions
a day after having been lam@@ inated by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the head of the environmental protection authority , his earlier decision , to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era to reduce emissions smo@@ g @-@ causing pollution .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change when his agency proved to be subject to the needs of state environmental authorities towards real@@ ising faster than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the col@@ lage , which was raised against his previous position in a federal session .
it is about a period that ran out on 1 October for states to adhere to the standards of bott@@ om@@ it o@@ zone in 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he will delay the observance of a year to study his authority more time to study the plan and avoid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to inter@@ fere in local decisions or to im@@ pe@@ de economic growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tru@@ mp prosec@@ utor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma was a reliable opponent of severe environmental protection regulations for a long time .
since his arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeated repeatedly to block or to delay the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels .
the sudden conversion from Wednesday is the most recent legal envelope for the P@@ ru@@ denti@@ al roll@@ back agenda .
last month , a federal court martial in Washington decided that the EPA approved has passed its authority as he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of Obama administration , the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce meth@@ ane .
in one on the evening of the evening , P@@ ru@@ itt published its turn@@ around in o@@ zone standards quite simply the willingness of EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely performance of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under former administr@@ ations , the EPA has often not observed the deadlines for the execution and then waited to set the appointment for the execution &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who def@@ aul@@ ted the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation by judicial proceedings , and we take deadlines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also accept the law and authority we have . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the opinion of the EPA is that P@@ ru@@ b will eventually use his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; authority for delay and all the other legally available &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure that the rules &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Re@@ public@@ ans in the Congress are pushing for a wider re@@ establishment of the o@@ zone rules .
a draft law adopted last month is supposed to delay the implementation of the rules of 2015 by at least eight years .
the measure was not yet made available in the Senate .
the New York General state attorney Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man who led the Coalition of the States to lam@@ ents the EPA in this week , said the group intended to maintain the legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conversion of EPA - following our kittens - is an important gain for health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by smo@@ g who flows into their churches &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new York joined in this case California , Connecticut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Maine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ien , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil o@@ zone is created when poll@@ ut@@ ants from cars , power plants , oil plays , chemical plants , and other sources in the atmosphere in sunlight react .
the resulting smo@@ g can cause severe groups of people serious breathing problems , and every year contribute to thousands of premature death inci@@ dents .
representatives of the public health system and the environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered over P@@ ru@@ sion surprising course change .
&quot; it is worrying how much pressure it takes to preserve this reasonable step by those responsible for the protection of the air that we inhal@@ e to breathe , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Diversity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue to fight against the ideological cr@@ us@@ ade of the Tru@@ mp government to fight against environmental poll@@ uting and their particular interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tum@@ ors celebrates 750 years St. Hil@@ arius church
750 years St. Hil@@ arius church : at the anniversary of the anniversary of the Berg@@ kirche is invited to the old cemetery @-@ area in Tum@@ lingen on Sunday , 16 July at 16.@@ 30 am to a Seren@@ ade .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village is the historical St. Hil@@ arius system a popular place to stay .
the visitors of the sixth Ben@@ e@@ fi@@ z @-@ Seren@@ ade can be enchanted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and sponsors of Tum@@ lin@@ gens at their concerns .
Walter Mart@@ ini emphasises : &quot; it is a unique d@@ ör@@ fine Klein@@ od . &quot;
in the year 12@@ 67 the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ chapel was mentioned for the first time in the Württemberg &apos;s Ur@@ g@@ book : Graf Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with that of the par@@ o@@ cer@@ vi@@ ous Eber@@ hard by Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver .
according to the wording of the judgment after the tum@@ my mountain apart from the same parish church there was a glorious court , to which the church or the Pat@@ ron@@ age was right and not the other way round .
so there were people there .
as from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt of 18@@ 58 , was next to the under@@ village and the Ober@@ dorf , which today is still to be recognized today in the village of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; Berg &quot; of the third , the splendid settlement of the village .
old maps from the period around 1600 under@@ pin these historical circumstances .
the Pat@@ ron@@ ats@@ recht was born of the early medieval peculi@@ arity .
a Lord , who built a church , married and occupied with a pastor , continued to keep the owner of this church and was able to inher@@ it this own church .
associated with it was the right to use a pastor or to propose a new pastor .
three alt@@ ars were there in the church and two bells on the tower .
the biggest of the two de@@ bar@@ st at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell set then for the first time 16@@ 92 , but had to be released later in the Second World War in 1942 .
in the 30 @-@ year war ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the shut@@ ters were introduced and the bells are stolen .
the roof was un@@ dense .
17@@ 96 lag@@ ged French troops near the church .
they removed the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
remains of the Church thre@@ aten 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 the tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery also served as the last resting place for the dead from listening .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was expanded and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was cancelled .
only the cherry tower could be left .
in the New Year @-@ eight 18@@ 34 , a storm the storm and half over@@ threw one .
to prevent a hurt , the tower was cancelled .
only today &apos;s still existing tur@@ m@@ ity remained as a witness to the 750 year old church history .
today , Horst K@@ mos@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ her from the &quot; creative reti@@ ring &quot; as successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn the Hil@@ arius system .
as an organizer , the friends and Pat@@ rons were invited to invite friends and sponsors on Sunday , 16 July , to the sixth Seren@@ ade on the ancient cemetery of St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ chapel .
it is designed by the com@@ bo of Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with the contributions of Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ te@@ is .
Hartmut Rom@@ ann speaks the final word .
the program starts at 16.@@ 30 pm .
the admission is 10 : 30 AM .
to the ji@@ b of the Seren@@ ade , a ch@@ trunk takes place in front of the cemetery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organis@@ ers set out the fantastic view out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Seren@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
the organis@@ ers hope to receive many supporters to preserve the historical St. Hil@@ arius system that is of importance for tum@@ ours and list@@ ener .
the friends and promot@@ ers of Tum@@ lin@@ gens feel particularly committed to the homeland of the homeland , such as Seren@@ ade @-@ organizer Walter Mart@@ ini vali@@ dated .
association wants to check approval of wind wheels
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim does &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sees no legal prerequisite for the construction and therefore has turned into the country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim is called &quot; Land Council Andreas Co@@ ils ( CD@@ U ) to take back his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the bu@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette .
it is illegal .
the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval of 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette could not have been allowed to have wind turbines , as at the time in qu@@ ads only existed on the border line to swal@@ lows a wind @-@ concentration zone .
within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are basically possible , at the same time , the concentration zone , but also the exclusion of wind use for the rest of the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the zones should prevent a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saving &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the landscape . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the town of Four@@ sen had a second wind @-@ concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , but which had not approved the District government Düsseldorf , because of a form of formations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the lack of plan@@ ing legal requirement , the given authorization is un@@ lawful after as illegal and therefore , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Christoph Er@@ kens , chairman of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of affairs : the city council had again decided before the summer break again the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette ; a approval by the District government still stands out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ kens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this place is legally excluded in this place for the construction of wind turbines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the receipt of the invitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letter has been received for last week at the circle of four . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated a spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes her on the occasion to check the matter again .
but they do not expect that the procedure is stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with view to the current proceedings at the Board of Directors , the circle on Thursday did not want to express their contents on Thursday to the argum@@ entation of the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
NEW Re , an affiliate of the NEW , is planning to build four per 200 meters high wind@@ wheels on an area at the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette .
already last year , the company had participated in which the town of Four@@ sen is central , P@@ acht@@ ver@@ ters with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of great terrain .
with the construction of the four wind turbines , the power requirement of around 11 400 households can be covered - this corresponds to approximately one fifth of the electricity consumption of all four thousand households .
the NEW Re wants to invest around 20 million euros .
last summer , four @-@ star city gave the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the wind park Lin@@ ni@@ ch near Aachen , as well as a stake in a wind power plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district Hein@@ sberg .
car and tractor trucks together : woman dies at terrible accident
one horrible traffic Sun@@ ni voted on Friday afternoon at 10 o &apos;clock on the L 333 between Nieder@@ s@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhine @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ district ) .
a woman has been in@@ ju@@ red .
two further persons have been slightly wounded .
the provincial road continued over hours locked .
after police statements , a 17 @-@ year young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch took part in the frame of the accompanying chassis with their 53 @-@ year mother as the accompanying person the L 333 in the direction of Bo@@ gel .
city and dealer planning &quot; home @-@ shop &quot; -@@ weekend
bad Langen@@ sal@@ za@@ er and people from the region are to re@@ discover shopping in the city center in September .
the commercial club and the municipal authorities want to use the weekend on 8th and 9th September to l@@ ure the inhabitants to the shopping stroll into the city center .
as the president of the business@@ man , Christian König , announced the &quot; home @-@ Shopping &quot; -@@ weekend the customers to raise awareness , which offers its own town away from the usual supermarket .
according to the market , there is therefore a market with regional providers , similar to the weekly market .
in addition , local companies are to present themselves with their educational locations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the shops of the city centre are to invite you to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ It@@ ter@@ night shopping &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action is not only aimed at residents of the city and the surrounding region .
in preparation for commerci@@ als in the radio , an internet video and printed bag , which point to the Ak@@ tions weekend , so Christian König .
administration and commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Chamber of Commerce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this makes the business association and the city into another stage of the project &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive downtown &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these include new offers such as the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ak@@ tiv day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the Brun@@ nen@@ fest with a purchase Sunday , talks with all commercial and hosts to move them to active participation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
attractive offers on Saturday and sale on parking charges on this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potential should be re @-@ opened new or again .
these include spa guests and tourists .
but also many locals would have lost the city center at shopping from a glance .
in the end , all of this would contribute to in@@ vigor@@ ate the city center - up to landlords , the businesses of the whole city and associations .
it turned to overcome with a network the Le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy that was partly wider , King had said in the spring .
Bir@@ git Stre@@ ich , head of the I@@ HK Centers in Müh@@ l@@ hausen distributed that at the nationwide third &quot; homeland @-@ shopping &quot; -@@ day , the first time five Thur@@ in@@ gian cities participate .
in addition to Bad Langen@@ sal@@ za , this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and B@@ lei@@ cher@@ ode .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sol@@ der &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the appreciation of the local trade , promote its significance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stre@@ ich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the action under fe@@ eder of the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners also makes clear that every citizen can influence his direct environment themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two dead and several wounded left to U.S. school
during construction it came to a gas recovery in the school building .
new further people have been in@@ ju@@ red .
in a gas erup@@ tion in the U.S. Minneapolis , two people were killed and nine further in@@ ju@@ red , some of them were heavy .
according to the fire fighting was still a hur@@ ried in critici@@ zed state .
a man died as a part of a school building in the explosion .
a first mis@@ ses was later also found dead .
in the dead it was the posed of the school .
as un@@ happiness , the authorities suspected working on a gas line .
at the holiday time only a few people stopped in the building of the Minne@@ ha@@ ha Academy .
Tru@@ mp continued by pressing trans@@ cription by telephone calls in Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the border wall
trans@@ cription by phone call between US @-@ president Donald Tru@@ mp and guides from Mexico and Australia were published by Washington Post .
on January 27th , Tru@@ mp called on a phone with the Mexican presidency En@@ rique Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to to listen to publicly known that he would not pay for a planned borders .
the U.S. president mis@@ ses him because he had publicly denoun@@ ced the wall to him . saying , he said to him , &quot; This may not say the press . &quot;
Tru@@ mp launched his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall in the southern border of the USA , and fluctu@@ ate Mexico for the project .
trans@@ cription his first bond with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and unveil@@ ed a tense change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Tru@@ mp said Mr. Turn@@ bull , that a trade for the US refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mies &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and that the existence in the trade , which was convey@@ ed by the Government Obama to look like a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after having proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees in the US . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Tru@@ mp ended the call after having said Mr Turn@@ bull , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the most uncomfortable call for the whole day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mo@@ ore Ford mass@@ acre : activists lead rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice again
a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mercury was driving by a group of spectators in the rural Monroe , Georgia , and moved to the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore .
before the car , the four black passengers and a white driver had to reach the bridge , a group of white men joined with tissues to block its way .
the leader of the mo@@ obs - a man middle aged in a con@@ i@@ fer@@ ous strike - took a long train at its cig@@ ar and looked after through the wind@@ shield .
in@@ doors the occup@@ ants in fear .
&quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; bro@@ ods the man .
&quot; Ho@@ l him out of the car ! &quot;
Schre@@ ie cr@@ ush the silence , as a young black man cr@@ ush@@ ed from the passenger &apos;s seat .
fortunately , this horrible scene , which was played on July 22 , was just a desc@@ end .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when a loop is thrown around the neck from &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; almost everyone in the audience very real si@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 citizens come back to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in the two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - from K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
nobody was ever charged because of the murder .
&quot; it truly is in@@ comprehensible that in all these years no single person was arrested - even though we see them in our communities , although we know who they are , &quot; said T@@ yr@@ one Broo@@ ks , who helps in the organization of production .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a dirt on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former meeting of the State of Georgia and a lifetime of civil rights .
for him the im@@ position as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual memory of the Monroe community that has never been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to end prosecution , we want to end , we want healing , we want healing , but first we must receive justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot reach healing and reconciliation until we receive justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a court of court presents a beg@@ wel of the corp@@ se of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on 27 July 1946 .
according to F@@ BI files that were obtained from the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding Graf@@ es were susp@@ icious .
but none was ever charged .
although the susp@@ ects have been on free foot for decades , citizens say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch @-@ actions in the whole city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice made a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice in Georgia for the first time to leave their vote in the summer .
about at the same time as the election st@@ ach according to the F@@ BI of the black Far@@ mp@@ gu@@ ardian Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight down - supposedly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said , the smells in the city had been that H@@ ester had slept with Mal@@ com@@ s Mrs. Dor@@ othy and that the baby she carried away , not from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , so the F@@ BI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her cous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
but when they removed himself from prison and the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge nä@@ ked , around a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison , who has been preparing the mor@@ de and arranged , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it excl@@ u@@ des a F@@ BI report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a basic agreement between state and local prosecution which was not only involved in the murder , evidence , and the identity of witnesses promised . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks still formulated it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a electoral mass@@ acre , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you register and vote , then you will happen here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
almost a decade is C@@ ass@@ andra Gre@@ ene headed the annual desc@@ end of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their presentation is vivid , ign@@ ant and explained in a kind of deep racism , of which many believe that he no longer exists in America .
it &apos;s hard to look and look even more difficult , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the mo@@ b because we then face with its ugly in us all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I cannot build a relationship with you if you do not want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have made through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ sals for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen White and the rest Schwar@@ ze - into a room and lou@@ dly , as a Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ played overview of the piece started .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Green@@ es Co @-@ director .
he has played the role of Chief C@@ lan@@ mit@@ ry for years , but he never said the role will never become easier .
&quot; I feel dirty , because I am not so , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh .
&quot; but I think it is very important to preserve this story in life because we don &apos;t want to return to those times . &quot;
on the other side of the room the actors D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , the Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester play their lines .
the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester , crying and it be@@ zel , angry that he has slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , n -- he , disappeared from my own property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ cona er@@ wi@@ t the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs am lou@@ der .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; asked Ras@@ cona .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still ki@@ ch@@ ever . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just don &apos;t believe that white people at that time &apos;@@ n --- he said &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we@@ ather@@ ed one of the other black performers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you just have to meet the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
and that is exactly where the energy shifts in the room , a feeling of cam@@ ar@@ ader@@ ie replaces the discomfort .
everyone is busy to get this right now , not just because of the game but also because of memory of the four sol@@ dered people .
the scene starts again .
this time , when Ras@@ cona the N @-@ word says , he says it sharp and with after@@ print .
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition ends violent and fast .
there is scre@@ ams , shots and then silence .
a woman , dressed with a dream dress , stands over the corp@@ ses of the actors and performs Billi@@ e Holidays traum@@ atic lob@@ es &quot; st@@ range fruit . &quot;
your voice breaks out with every second word .
about one hundred meters behind it there is a group of about four dozen spectators swe@@ at and tears from the eyes .
the audience is divided almost ev@@ enly between black and white .
one pair is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , traveled to see the performance , many come down only the road .
they have experienced all nearly eight hours of Georgian moisture when Broo@@ ks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bst@@ ones of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point the mur@@ ders stayed one an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when one stands on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch Mor@@ en took place , the air feels spec@@ kl@@ ed .
when the last notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and insp@@ ected the corp@@ ses .
children ho@@ cken on their heads , register the fake blood and the silent body and whis@@ per@@ ing each other .
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; mur@@ mu@@ red a small boy , as if he wants to remember .
after a few minutes , Gre@@ ene the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw up the mo@@ ose line and wi@@ pe her tears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w convertible Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the turn that has played the C@@ lan@@ der .
Nick Ras@@ cona embr@@ aces two of his fellow @-@ players and then breaks down in their arms , the emotional burden of the performance breaks after him .
&quot; it is okay , &quot; whis@@ pers one of women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that this is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you have done this for one reason . &quot;
later the audience sets up with the actors for dinner together .
on a table ch@@ atting a white pair of Atlanta prompted about the post @-@ position with a black pair who have just met them .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski fought therefore to find words which feeling the performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... from people to come like you themselves and do what they look like you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what this really does with me can believe me that the Lyn@@ ne still goes on &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today the only police &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is called &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room T@@ yr@@ one Broo@@ ks Hof at his table , he e@@ ats and reminds of the civil rights .
he said he started to plan the performance next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the im@@ position is inspir@@ ational in some way , as it describes the hor@@ rors of what we have endure , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is so if we learn nothing about it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history is condemned to repeat them . &quot;

the audience would like to thank the ensemble with strong applause .

large applause are available for the festival @-@ orchestra which shows for the first time on stage - given the big heat again into empty leisure clothes .
with tension was the appearance of Frank Cast@@ orf and his regi@@ stra@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 he had yet to leave a strongh@@ old of pipe with him , there were five years later great rejo@@ icing on which the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bu@@ d &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to have enjoyed .
&quot; one noticed that the audience has grown together with the &quot; ring &quot; in a certain way , &quot; she had said briefly before the performance of d@@ pa .
the audience did not only have a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it was also an understanding of our view .
I prefer a positive ré@@ sum@@ é .
max quantity works as a volunteer
you are working in a volunteer year equal to several places .
where everywhere ?
quantity : usually in St@@ einf@@ urt in the Furn@@ iture , once a week , I help here in Gre@@ ens in the furniture bridge .
and I already worked on the school in open all day .
what are your experiences with it ?
quantity : it is a beautiful , broad spectrum that I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
you are 26 years now , so a late volunteer .
how does that come from ?
quantity : I have made Ab@@ it@@ ur .
and then an civil engineering , we say , we say successfully .
I have known for me that there is wrong thing for me and I want to do something else to work with people .
and then I asked what you do .
take a social year , since there is an insight , there you can see how it is on site , in the focal point perhaps also , really is .
and was it so ?
quantity : I have collected great impressions .
in the winter semester , I will start my studies in the social field .
I will study dual , probably in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne , a social worker training and studi@@ ere in Ham@@ m at the Fach@@ hoch@@ schule .
is it not something unusual during volunteer services to have several different types of use ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it always comes to where you make his FS@@ J .
you can make it from Alter@@ sheim to youth work - in all kinds of fac@@ ets of social work .
with me it was very varied .

I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really happens .
otherwise than in civil engineering ?
quantity : well clear , here it is not about to be reck@@ oned off .
it has always been another human mind that each has a very different story behind .
whether a refugee , whether a teen@@ ager is made out of the family - you must always be aware of it .
very interesting .
and you did not have any touch ?
quantity : I am not the type .
it is a area that gives a lot .
lots of love , lots of kindness .
there are also negative moments , but so life is just .

five soldiers and a interpreter have been wounded , shared an explanation of Nato .
un@@ confirmed local reports therefore died in the incident in the district of Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h also three civilians .

in an opinion of Nato there was , the explosion on Thursday night was to be , when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; of persons having been attacked . &quot;
the statement states that all compar@@ isons are in a stable state and are treated in the US military hospital at the air@@ field Bag@@ ram .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group , known as a so @-@ called Islam@@ ist state ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ o , is a great concern for NATO troops located in the near Bag@@ ram .

EPA returns decision to del@@ aying the smo@@ g rule after rubber
the US @-@ American environmental protection authority has a decision to delay a regulation by the Obama administration , repe@@ aled the States committed to in@@ dem@@ ise the Smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this was a day after 15 countries passed the agency because of the step@@ per .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA approved late on Wednesday the decision to drive so called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; o@@ zone @-@ regulations 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and said , they show the commitment of the agency to work with states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and recall that we respond to our state partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says EPA &apos;s boss Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt in June had announced the intention of EPA , the o@@ zone @-@ regulations which must be measured in part of the country of poll@@ ut@@ ant emissions in order to comply with stri@@ c@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year up to October 2018 .
a group of 15 most largely democratic states , together with the district of Columbia , on Tuesday law@@ suit , and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tru@@ mp has tried to raise a wide range of environmental impacts , which has imposed the former President Barack Obama , as part of a broader agenda , which is to boost economic growth according to Tru@@ mp .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the efforts have triggered the return of Democrats and nature groups to worry about the impact of greater emissions on public health . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the website of EPA says that the inhal@@ e of air , the o@@ zone contains &apos; the lung function and can enhance the atoms symptoms , such as as@@ thma .
community wants common areas
in the end , the decision was clear : in two counterparts , the council of flu@@ orn wind blows the establishment of a common area in the future retirement homes .
prior to the discussion there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the still missing property section was signed , reported Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
although it will still take , until the so far the church community of belonging space is in the municipal possession , but there is now no plans for that of a private investor to st@@ em@@ ing project more .
there is a discussion regarding a communal space .
one of the two investors , who are still in the boat , offered to meet the church .
on the ground floor , he would provide a living space - approximately 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with an area of 70 square meters of space for a special price .
the administration and majority of the council did not float such a common area as meeting place only for the inhabitants of the sen@@ iors , but open to the church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example , the word of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made the turn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reconc@@ iled the decision made by providing funds for the current household already last autumn , through funding opportunities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the construction is in the renovation area .
the establishment of a communal space would be , so reported T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent .
the resolutions proposed to sign@@ aling to the investor is that you don &apos;t want to throw it in this respect , that both Satt@@ el@@ - - which is at the ambient temperature - as well as P@@ ult@@ d@@ ach - which makes the iner@@ ation decreases and the construction of economic power - can be made possible .
need@@ less , so does not mean Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer , be this addition .
if &apos; s helps : unanim@@ ously it happens to the body .
not so easy it goes to the common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela Call refers to the many own buildings , with whom you are not progres@@ sing right now in the common room out of the window , she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m hard with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Stadium absolutely speaks for the common room - but absolutely against a municipal participation .
it is behind it a covered sub@@ session in any case ag@@ it@@ ating or even foreign investors .
this is not so , because with the acquisition of the area , one does not give a grant , but also come a real , in case of doubt the market @-@ market counter , is the counter @-@ speech .
stadium application to ple@@ dge the resolutions proposed accordingly , finds three advocates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , it remains in two contrasts at the original program , the Stefan H@@ aller summar@@ izes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we touch the decision , we make a huge tre@@ k to close a giant gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

w@@ ander in the resin of Stern to star
in Har@@ z the nationwide first &quot; Star@@ pf@@ ad &quot; is said .
this is planning the association Stern@@ atory Saint Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planetary path in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Star@@ pf@@ ad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; come forward to the information requested by many Har@@ z@@ visitors , the name of it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he connectors nature , science , exercise and athle@@ tic performance .
members want to set the members along the planned route and inform them about stars and star images .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association is planning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well achiev@@ able installations at five to six places &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
question Che@@ ese St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber .
the information on the tables should be added via the internet .
this is why the location of thousands of choice plays a good mobile network reception .
also Acces@@ sibility is a criterion .
later , the Star@@ pf@@ ad train is to be extended by train .
&quot; on the Star@@ pf@@ ad , the spect@@ ator experienced a lot of knowledge , for example , about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; explained the association .
in addition , they learned why stars would have different colors or why a star had more light than another , although he is far farther away .
I also im@@ par@@ able in which constellation can be found a selected star and when it is best to see .
the association has been operating in the mountains of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg since 2014 .
the location in the middle of the Har@@ z National Park is one of the Bundes@@ amt für Natur@@ schutz among the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
frequently they are from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a galaxy with naked eye clearly visible .
since 2003 on the initiative of the Förder@@ verein planet@@ arium , there is something similar to the planned stars - the planetary path .
starting from Geb@@ har@@ ds Hotel in Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planetary road leads up to H@@ ain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; extr@@ ater@@ restri@@ al &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( Community Glei@@ ches ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the stalls with the single planets - including the g@@ d@@ warf @-@ planned Plu@@ to at the end point - are positioned exactly in the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ inking so on a sphere of 6.5 milli@@ metres in diameter , while the sun is exactly 75 metres away and measures 70 cen@@ timet@@ res .
the entire distance of the planetary we@@ ges amounts to a good four kilometers .
while the light of sun is needed until Plu@@ to about eight hours , ped@@ estri@@ ans need a good hour until St@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
ped@@ estri@@ ans are therefore faster than light in the cosmos .
the march to the next Fi@@ x@@ stern but would last a half a year .

Gar@@ cia stretched out the right hand and said , &quot; How do you say Champion ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I wish you good luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Rub@@ aga on Saturday night at 7 p.m. on ES@@ PN .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as the couple for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas , that a possible show@@ down between fighters would be the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perfect size &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am a former fe@@ ather @-@ weight , &quot; reminded Gar@@ cia .
&quot; I have asc@@ ended for bronze &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I am not so great .
I am small for 140 .
I want to run on loan weight .
and he has to move on loan weight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
all that demand the fans .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko has agreed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boxes needs this battle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kli@@ m@@ mas asked if it should be on Pay @-@ per @-@ View , part of a strategy , the Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko with a 135 @-@ pound debut in this year to arrange in the next summer with Gar@@ cia a date ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 button @-@ outs ) which also has interest in the fight against the winner of Jor@@ ge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Campbell after their body @-@ weight campaign in the forum on September 23 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this battle could take place in the pay @-@ per @-@ view mode , because all fans asked for him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia and was later open to fight with the network that offers the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can produce this kind of attention .
when always they are ready ... &quot;
Gar@@ cia said he appreciate Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko as &quot; an enormous fighters , &quot; and he may possibly take part in his Saturday battle .
but Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko held in the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he looks to see the three @-@ battle champion from River@@ side , &quot; very slowly , I &apos;m sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted to know the co @-@ Aus . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said , the focus is to show stroke , then boxes .
both said they could feel the momentum which revol@@ ve for their own battle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the battle that needs to be performed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other fight creates so much attention and excitement .
I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; said Gar@@ cia .
Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko said : &quot; I have been waiting for the top fighters and that is Mi@@ key .
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four wounded left to tire
in the case of an accident on the A7 , four people were killed on Thursday in the afternoon .
after the first information , the driver of an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira lost up to 16.@@ 30 clock shortly before the connecting location market wide probably after a tyre plat@@ ter control over his vehicle .
the passenger ev@@ apor@@ ated to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he ski@@ pped over and then lie on the roof in the green strip .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were badly in@@ ju@@ red during the accident .

Fort@@ unas Hoffmann : &quot; Tri@@ erk@@ ette works better &quot;
Andre Hoffmann is hoping after 2 : 2 to the season opening up against Braunschweig that brings the optimization of the def@@ enses in Au@@ e points .
with the first season of Andre Hoffmann , Andre Hoffmann was satisfied , with the result too , would not have been the two opponents at the 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were two oppos@@ ites to much , and we must fit in Au@@ e even better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the def@@ enses of Fortuna Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains the triangle is to be further optimized .
and a gate after an open @-@ off , the continu@@ ance will not want to go into any longer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future it will be that no more besides Michael ( R@@ ensing ) turns on line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better ri@@ ghtful after the experience in the preparation with the tri@@ erk@@ ette than with the four @-@ legged friends .
&quot; still I don &apos;t know how we will act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his Trainer of Fried@@ helmet , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , &quot; because we are just in the three @-@ positions in KA@@ AN Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko G@@ ie@@ th@@ el@@ mann players who can build it well , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; a prerequisite is , but that we can even better harmon@@ ize and do not afford as many different errors . &quot;
of course , Hoffmann also drives to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if one cannot speak after an un@@ decided start , do not know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the performance could quite be okay , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we can concentrate on Sunday with four points and concentrate on the podium , we will certainly be able to speak of a proper season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of this I wanted to know nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the start into the season assessed only after six to eight players , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fried@@ helmet &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Frederick &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saying &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim pre@@ matur@@ ely because of an in@@ we@@ ather@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now they can practically start the season quasi on a home game , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann , that the players from Au@@ e might be even a little fres@@ her , since they had no serious and complete game like Fortuna to have a favorite in the bones .
&quot; but they don &apos;t know so 100 % where they are currently standing , &quot; says the interior of the Fortuna .
although the guests come from the Rhin@@ eland as a slight favorite on Sunday in the encounter at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need them away , just because we have the claim to come under the first six , is ble@@ ak , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance sheet is at only a defeat against Au@@ e from nine games really positive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga that one must hit from the start &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explains Fort@@ unas Chef@@ coach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such a statement would be to be arro@@ gant and adul@@ ter@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so , Funk@@ el wants to experience his players on Sunday in no case .
new results of the Swedish asylum @-@ assessment tests published
the recent results of testing for asylum seekers in Sweden who have subjected to a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish agency for For@@ ens@@ ary Medicine ( mysteries ) has started with the execution of the tests last year .
they are supposed to be more precise during the asylum procedure , after the Swedish migration authority ( mig@@ rations ) because of mistakes in the assessment of the correct age of some refugees was critici@@ zed .
until today , migration cuts 6.@@ 8@@ 80 has sent to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from the period from mid March to 31 July 2017 .
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were assessed as 18 or older while in other 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency evaluated that the person &apos; may be 18 years old or older . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may be under 18 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tests are conducted only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are consistently stable in recent months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not see a big difference in statistics of past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the magazine The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases in which the person has been assessed for over 18 years does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers has grown over his age .
in May , the Agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases to suggest that the sub@@ searched person is 18 years old or older . &quot;
when the newspaper S@@ ven@@ ska D@@ ag@@ bla@@ det the 5@@ 81 published results were investigated , it confirmed that in the 243 of these cases the person had openly said that she will be 18 years old .
the method of medical age assessment , at the X @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and resonance imaging of knee joints , which are analyzed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , was also critici@@ zed in some areas .
a skep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ inska Institute , whose work covers the assessment of biological maturity of people to see if they were sooner or later than usual through pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t believe that the type of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the work on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
on Wednesday a seven ton of heavy emphasis was installed at the bridge at the eastern outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; we are very good at the time , it runs great , &quot; says Rein@@ hold L@@ asi@@ ly , Bau@@ Manager at the Department of Road@@ and Transport in the Govern@@ ments si@@ dium Freiburg .
in April the works began on all three sandy bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the construction is provided for October and E@@ asi@@ ly is certain that the timetable is observed .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads over the tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a v@@ aul@@ ted bridge from concrete , which is bon@@ ded with red bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total @-@ length of 4,@@ 80 meters .
it was built in the year 1900 .
as the two other bridges also , it has now come into the years .
in order to ensure stability and traffic safety , the three construction works will now be thoroughly renovated .
the other two bridges run over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built of red bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , and 10.@@ 60 metres long .
the bridge at the town entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach is now on the northern side of the northern side of a 1,@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons heavy so @-@ called Brü@@ ck@@ Du@@ appe .
this is a side @-@ locking which is also used as a operating path .
the southern part of the bridge should be used on Friday a 2,@@ 20 meter wide fr@@ appe .
then the pedestrian is to be gone .
the special thing is that it concerns finished parts , a patent by the Sch@@ ram@@ berger Company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already provided with the patented Brü@@ ck@@ cards .
particular finger@@ sp@@ it@@ zen@@ ith has requires the fe@@ eder of power by the Bau@@ werk in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .

the residents were informed about the project in advance of work .
in addition , first fish and cr@@ abs had to be dra@@ gged .
for bridges between the building building and the gathering in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , the traffic is regulated by a traffic light .
for construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bacher local entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; Tann@@ en@@ hof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; is locked .
the costs for the three Brü@@ ck@@ ens@@ ani@@ ties are around 700 000 Euro .
the whole is financed through the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ under protest in German potato salad
it does not appear so often that parties are pulling on a beach , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) comes together , what else is difficult to bring under a hat .
the parties ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , left ) belong to a broad coalition which indicates that day peaceful flag , because the Af@@ D invites in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle Ron@@ dell to the &apos; large electoral campaign . &quot;
and well @-@ known names to the start brings - like Alice Wei@@ del , which formed together with Alexander Gau@@ land the top of directors for the Bundestag on 24 September , and the dep@@ uty president of the Beat@@ les of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are already hours before the start of the event are not wanting to listen to the Af@@ ters , but demonstrate .
the motto &quot; The Ei@@ fel remains colourful . &quot;
originally the town @-@ picnic was planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; on the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but now finds the parking lot below the Ron@@ d@@ ells - and therefore directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ ak event in the Stadthalle .
a colorful picture that offers itself .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , President of the Forum A world and one of the decisive organizers , is really happy : &quot; great how many people came here together . &quot;
there are music and lots of food , including a &apos; German potato salad , which could also eat the Af@@ D easily , &quot; says the woman who brought him .
the police have attracted many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence mainly at the station , which is just a few meters from the venues .
how is the Af@@ D returned to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ bourg was reported by the Af@@ D volcan@@ ei@@ fel , he tried to get such an event and get the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had initially asked in Dau@@ n , but there was an error because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ mes not enough parking available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ bourg is pleased that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with a view of the event on the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ vor@@ platz , he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of the people , main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also does it : against 20 clock on the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ vor@@ platz offers a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle various speakers , including the rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ pf@@ alz Af@@ D chair Uwe boy .
in the hall are about 200 li@@ sten@@ ers who are waiting for the leading kan@@ gar@@ ine for the Bundest@@ ags election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the dep@@ uty president of the Beat@@ les of Stor@@ ch , will hold their speeches .
unchanged is the police presence , but so far the officials had a quiet evening .
a little more than an hour takes the Af@@ D event , the guests on the court have a longer breath , but it is also available shortly after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police can push it - no special occurrence .

both sol@@ o@@ ists are winners and winners of many international competitions and have sol@@ opo@@ si@@ tions in European top orchestra .

both unite the desire to cross the borders on their instruments , but also to merge the limits of the different gen@@ res .
so Johann Sebastian Bach sounds with the two like in a new gu@@ ise , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; world music &quot; united with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece of &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the J@@ az@@ ze@@ ch@@ op@@ rei@@ str@@ ata N@@ ils Wo@@ gram , mix classic , jazz and free games to a fascinating entire artwork .
this core part of the program was first performed this spring with ri@@ tist success in Freiburg .

Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about their bis@@ exual ality
&quot; some people love gri@@ lled meat and will eat him up to the end of their life .
but I want to try everything , &quot; so Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart very openly about their bis@@ exual ality .
&quot; when I sit in gri@@ lled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh , that was cool , what comes next to the next ? &apos; .
the most well @-@ known relationship of Horn@@ í star was that of her &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; colleagues Robert Patt@@ inson , who eventually went bitter .
despite this ass@@ ures the br@@ ush@@ ette Dar@@ stell@@ ate against the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was in any serious trouble that I was dat@@ et .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or do you believe it , I would have played it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after its separation , Kri@@ sten has given that it was bis@@ exual , &quot; I have always lived and believed in that du@@ alism .
so it has never been confused or hin@@ dered .
I just liked it never to be taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially among them they suffered according to &quot; Bang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but in the school time they prefer to dress like a bu@@ b : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this really has in@@ ju@@ red me .
when I was eleven the children , I would look like a bu@@ b .
I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and ashamed .
now I look back and think : &apos; girl , be proud of you ! &apos; .
especially the public did not love her love life : &quot; people expect you to deal with a certain way and anno@@ yed me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some call me a bit uncomfortable , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself to be justified before all the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Gover@@ nor of West Virginia announces that he changes the Party
. the democratic Gover@@ nor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday night with a manifestation with President Tru@@ mp that he will change the party .
whether you like it or not , the Democrats have been removed from me , &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice .
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of things ... today I will tell you as the inhabitants of West Virginia , I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the manifestation broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the re@@ public@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; added Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as a trainer , I would say that it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp promised a great announcement at the West Virginia R@@ ally .
Mr. Tru@@ mp won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice approved not the democratic candidate of Hill@@ ary Clinton .
Justice , which is according to For@@ bes the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes shows that he has co@@ war@@ min@@ ed in five states , and inherited a carbon store by his father .
it is worth $ 1,@@ 59 billion dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime the Republi@@ can National Committee on Thursday morning a statement on Thursday , in which it said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Party change of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow for a Democratic party that would rather go back to our country to be great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with only 15 Govern@@ ments and the control of the least legislative bodies in history is the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice only the last rejection of a party , which is from top to bottom without guidance and is unable to find a positive , engaging message , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the R@@ NC @-@ president R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in a statement to CB@@ S News . &quot; &quot; &quot;

despite his comments the IA@@ AF Congress was approved for the maintenance of the ground@@ ing that was imposed in November 2015 , after a report by the World @-@ Anti @-@ Doping Agency ( W@@ ada ) was found evidence of state @-@ based intelligence doping in Russia .
&quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF @-@ president Co@@ e den re@@ por@@ ters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire Council and the entire Congress were delighted that Russian Federation have experienced some fairly times and will do everything possible to make sure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e said he also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delighted that Russia accept the criteria for its re @-@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress has been made , but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force , that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Princip@@ le always was that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the dep@@ ra@@ ved system , &quot; he added
nin@@ et@@ een Russian athletes will start at the athle@@ tics World Championships on Friday in London according to the strict IA@@ AF criteria than neutral players .

agriculture ministers in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from greed , Lord Schmidt ?
Germany talks about contaminated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves .
agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is in an interview with the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
Mr. Schmidt , How can the consumer protect against poison@@ ed eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumer rights and consumers to look at exactly the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp @-@ up pressure .
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ grocery war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the Bundes@@ länder will present the latest information on the affected eggs bat@@ ches .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if we are currently aware of what we are presently aware , a health haz@@ ard is practically excluded .
now Al@@ di has the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the clarification of the Federal Minister of Agriculture is not really perceived ?
the food supervision is the task of the federal states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , my house has been immediately switched off and has been on the disclosure of Germany in close exchange with the authorities of the countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all information and risk evaluation are available for consumers .
trade has just as much as the manufacturers to ensure that the sold @-@ sold products are capable of transport and health .
if the back@@ board content of 0.@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded , these are not capable .
un@@ loaded eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time is not the enterprises to blame .
sitting production companies and consumers in the same boat ?
after the first level of knowledge , the production company meets no immediate fault .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rather , it must be expected due to mut@@ ally illegal practices of service companies with economic damages . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as always there is too little check@@ ers in the harvest case .
is it only lacking in the staff or on the concl@@ usive jurisdiction ?
it was just the official controls that have revealed the process .
for truth , however , food fraud and criminal energy can never be up to 100 percent excluded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is why there is a consequ@@ ent education of such actions and the hand@@ over to the prosecution authorities in cases where criminal off@@ ences are of decisive importance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already made many things several times that I expect a complete information from the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is the regular alarm on food safety really necessary ?
consumers and consumers have the right to get solely safe and reliable foods .
if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumer rights and consumers are rightly emp@@ tied .
due to the bre@@ d means manufacturer , traders and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
basically , it must be clear : the illegal use of the insec@@ ti@@ cides Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ delivered animals is unacceptable and must be immediately ended .
it must be consistent and worked on all levels at all levels .
I expect from all competent authorities that the facts is quickly and completely un@@ solved .
how the financial rules of the foot depend on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Mov@@ ing to Paris
the rules that aim to prevent immense issues of European foot@@ ball@@ ers , N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Wel@@ tre@@ k@@ ord @-@ Transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain are not disturbing .
any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Germain from the UEF@@ A , as the leading organization that monitors the European game has the power to offer cre@@ ws from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair Play rules launched in 2011 by UEF@@ A into Life , mean that PS@@ G eventually has to prove that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar was financed without big losses .
Barcelona has paid 222 million Euro ( 2@@ 62 million US $ ) to buy the Brazi@@ li@@ ans from his contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a sal@@ ary that will amount to ten million dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s moving to France .
PS@@ G can make sure that N@@ ey@@ mar under@@ writes and bring him into a galaxy of other stars , given the financing of the team through the energy of rich mi@@ stress of Qatar .
associations may apply a lot of money for the purchase of players , but they must be subject to legitimate recep@@ tions , giving them the break @-@ up point in their way to the football @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was conceived by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEF@@ A president in 2007 .
the former French player believed that associations in their quest for success had taken enormous debt to themselves , effectively frau@@ ds and ris@@ ed to ruin when banks or owners moved their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P moved from concentration to the debts of the clubs to monitor their losses .
the change meant that the business model , the novel A@@ br@@ amo@@ vich originally used in Chelsea - a club with potential and then vigor@@ ous invested to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a tough@@ er matter .
during the current three @-@ year period of FF@@ P period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can take losses in the amount of € 30 million .
and although Plat@@ ini 2015 fallen by the presidency in Un@@ gn@@ ade , his UEF@@ A successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ in continues to cry out of excessive spending .
&quot; surely FF@@ P is not dead and we will still intensify the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so that is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P against The Associ@@ ated Press in the past week .
although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a package , it can distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of its contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year treaty so that the solution for the next five years can be negotiated in the annual financial statements for the next five years .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has put the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a record of 60 million euros ( then 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the teams of teams for the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 to 21 players will be limited to the usual normal 25 players .
the UEF@@ A is searching for clubs that could try to over@@ see their financial view , by connecting their income by companies that are connected with the owners of a club .
while a Catalan company could see PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not be considered legitimate income .
exactly this happened in 2014 , when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of sponsor@@ ing the P@@ SA was infl@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that a part of PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come through payments of the organizational committee of the World Cup 2006 in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar have denied that N@@ ey@@ mar Cup Ambassador will be to be able to find out such a maneu@@ ver for the UEF@@ A regul@@ ators .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G means that the UEF@@ A will be more attentive to consider every attempt to deal with rules .
UEF@@ A did not have a prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s transfer , who are familiar with the situation on Thursday .
they said under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , since they were not authorized to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 with a turnover of 5@@ 4@@ 2.4 million euros has achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros .
the accounts for the last financial year must be released .
PS@@ G expects that N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrive a blessing for Sponsor@@ ing De@@ als , Mer@@ chan@@ dis@@ ing and Tri@@ kot@@ purchases .
the association expects sales after the signing of at least 30 percent .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players to see , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s withdrawal by claiming that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial doping &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President of the La League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish Daily AS in relation to Qatar &apos;s final owner of PS@@ G . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ar@@ senal @-@ Manager Ar@@ sen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares reservations from La League against a state which is financed by a society .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the owner and that has changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible .
it becomes very difficult to respect the financial Fair@@ play because you can have different ways or have different interests , if a country has such a great player to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new Scho@@ ol@@ supplier
in the past years Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y Bord @-@ chocolate has produced for the Swiss .
now , the s@@ alute is in front of a possible end : the airline causes the job to be new .
Swiss @-@ Spe@@ cher@@ in Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ ert confirmed on request of the news agency s@@ da an appropriate report of the newspaper &quot; Northern Switzerland &quot; from Friday .
according to current planning , Airline 1 new contract will commence in the first half of 2018 .
the products would have been reviewed every two or three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the current supplier of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y we are very satisfied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Spe@@ aker in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
around 17 million small red @-@ white Sho@@ gg@@ it@@ af@@ els to 14 grams per year are distributed by the passengers in front of the landing at the passengers .
at the cost , Swiss does not want to make information .
industry theories estimate the order volume in accordance with &quot; Northern Switzerland &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of about 1 billion Swiss francs .
but more important is always the advertising effect : for a shock manufacturer it is a pressed order .
how many applicants there is at the new tender , Swiss does not want to betra@@ y .
but there are only Swiss manufacturers .
according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y will strive for a renewal of the contract over the spring 2018 .
for the s@@ da , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion .
chocolate boards spread the Swiss since 2006 on board their flights .
before Swiss has completed a contract with the Mig@@ ros subsidiary , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut had supplied in collaboration with Hu@@ g the chocolate tablets .
the opportunity to place the logo , has conducted Swiss two and a half years ago with the start of the collaboration with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline works with different Swiss chocolate producers .
on long @-@ hau@@ l flights , customers of the First Class with goo@@ dies are spoiled by the Con@@ fis@@ ry Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in Business Class Nas@@ chen passengers Scho@@ gg@@ i of Lind@@ on and in Economy Class Scho@@ gg@@ i by Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
also on the short route , Swiss Scho@@ gg@@ i is distributed by Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , both in business and economy class .

nostal@@ gia goes to &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
this repetition of history is at the same time nostal@@ gic due to the glorious days of the characters of the 80 @-@ year era ( as the present@@ ers David W@@ ain and Michael Sho@@ oters the Sk@@ etch Com@@ edy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV turned ) , and for himself - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , like Elizabeth Banks , Amy Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Rud@@ d came to bigger things .
as a cultural fact , it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and an em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era of permanent memories .
but as franchise , it feels like the time would be short .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; First Day of Camp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worked surprisingly well , not only because of its absurd hum@@ ors ( it enth@@ s a original story for promising vegetables that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by stepping up at the core of the G@@ ags - actor @-@ sized age play children that are grown up - they still managed to win the im@@ possibility of winning the last part of the jo@@ kes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ten years &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its adults , which now play adults is less emotional @-@ rooted , and his par@@ o@@ dy goes more after the wat@@ ering principle , including a reef on the Stal@@ ker movies of the 90 @-@ er years as &quot; The Hand of Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; The Hand &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at a point look a character through an Apple @-@ Power@@ book , some in@@ line sc@@ ates and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the gracious C@@ oop ( Mr. Sho@@ oters ) , now Roman@@ aut@@ or , has not yet forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ e@@ au ) .
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has still not lost its vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another crazy mal@@ ign@@ ant P@@ lot , included in the Ronald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Sho@@ oters ) which is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well @-@ made impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always the exchange rates are the best part of franchise .
it &apos;s a lot of fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Rud@@ d , the Matt D@@ illons sub @-@ beard from &apos; Sing@@ les &apos; , whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old boy .
there are the moments of accidental mad@@ ness that could use this franchise as a kind of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until he reaches what I will show as its logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : T@@ w@@ enty years , whose final scene will show the gang of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; to visit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Amazon now remember another kind of nostal@@ gia : to the revival of the Cold War of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and even at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ low &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with his East @-@ against @-@ West Ring@@ battle @-@ I@@ kon@@ ography . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the com@@ edy created by Brian Gat@@ ewood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka created com@@ edy with Rh@@ ys Thomas as director gives an found TV series : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Bucharest , fought for truth , a@@ the@@ ism and the way of Marxism Lenin@@ ism .
the main wheels - a hard @-@ rare Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alogs from Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a exec@@ ender producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt will be synchronized to English .
it is an in@@ geni@@ ous idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice G@@ ags to watch ( the police spends the time to watch chess on TV how Americans might do with football ) .
and the list of the famous speakers - including Jenny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ ers@@ hal@@ a Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ unger Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - ensures a decent game &apos; Fin@@ de the voice out &apos; .
but &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; is very committed to the True Life Dr@@ amas - a mur@@ derer who bears a Re@@ agan mask , is involved - that it often plays like a single one .
with six long episodes , it moves to that and the com@@ edy is not fast or frequently enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which was re@@ directed to a lower length , his Ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p @-@ s@@ ati@@ re was better supply , since Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef always visit the American embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two big men who disappeared a bunch of Hamburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message for the imag@@ inary audience is that Western culture can do everything to feed for a money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian creators are not wrong : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we even make it with our own younger history and theirs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
strike against drugs @-@ ma@@ fia in the country
the police force a blow to the Italian ma@@ fia , in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Mit@@ tw@@ o@@ tomorrow , in the Black Forest @-@ Ba@@ ar @-@ district , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen , and Stuttgart were looking through numerous objects as the prosec@@ utor &apos;s Con@@ stance on Friday evening .
in doing so 15 accus@@ ations were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 and were already arrested in arrest warran@@ t against this .
in addition , the officials put greater amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , and several hundreds of hundreds of Euros .
at the same swe@@ eps in Italy two people were arrested .
against the two susp@@ ects Italians there were German arrest warran@@ t .
the two will probably be delivered to Germany .
in the action Italian and Bay@@ erische investig@@ ators were involved .
overall , over 300 polic@@ emen were in action .
the members of the ma@@ fia becomes organised drug crimin@@ ality , severe violence , tried murder , as well as Rau@@ b and black@@ mail .
already since summer 2016 , the Pro@@ sec@@ utor Con@@ stance is determined against organised drug trading in the South German area .
between the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Kon@@ stanz and Palermo there was a recur@@ ring exchange and investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ we@@ eil had almost daily contact with their colleagues on Sicily .
thus , the large application on the Mit@@ tw@@ ater morning was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo .

way lam@@ ents large gaps in the foreigners
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens that should not emerge , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : a report according to the foreig@@ ner in Germany indicates significant shortcomings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the lead to some serious mis@@ decisions in asylum seekers .
the representative for the refugee management of the federal government , Frank @-@ Jürgen way , has been made aware of a media report to large gaps in the country @-@ country @-@ cent@@ ric register .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defects in the recorded data could lead in asylum procedures and de@@ port@@ ations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; partly gra@@ vi@@ zing mis@@ choices &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in an analysis that is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; South German newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Register , the information according to ten million people with foreign citizenship , including about 5,@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU states .
the data will be managed according to approximately 600 self @-@ term authorities in Germany .
because the data has not been sufficiently well kept , the data quality in parts has not been well done so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in individual cases , data from 1921 have been found , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by people who have long been no longer alive , or from citizens who have become German citizens and no longer should arise in the register . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; faul@@ ty data @-@ inputs can slow@@ down significantly slow@@ down processes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it further to the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in statistics on out@@ fit people , we are persu@@ aded citizens who would not have to travel at all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but such false concessions led to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; led to a distor@@ ted debate on how to deal with excer@@ pts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it therefore in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the Federal Government has apparently begun to send refugee families with under 16 years old children back to Italy if they have traveled from there .
this is from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ ro@@ cker Zeitung . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the paper , it is said that BA@@ MF lead such proceedings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding families with children - except for inf@@ ants and to@@ dd@@ lers - after Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the end of 2014 it was practically no longer possible to find the newspaper under reference to the difficult situation on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin agreement is responsible for refugees from the EU state to reach them first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a mig@@ rant travels to another EU country , this state can send him back to the entry of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the reason , the Office is now : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile the mounting capacity for families with minor children in Italy greatly increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy made guarantees for the reception and accommodation for families .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( GM@@ GM@@ R ) have kept these commitments for sufficient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also other EU states would return refugees within the framework of the Dublin Convention . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the inn@@ acle political spokes@@ person in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Yel@@ p@@ ke , critici@@ zed this decision : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; families with children thre@@ aten due to the lack of the Italian asylum system of human rights and a haz@@ ard to the child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
extended result can be achieved

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is awesome as our body is laid out and we pay attention to the sp@@ ear@@ ing respect , which provide their blood for foreigners , nor is un@@ selfish , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; underlined Mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a single blood @-@ end helps several people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the circular leader of the German Red Cross ( DRC ) , Holger Ma@@ isen@@ bacher , because the preser@@ ves are distor@@ ted into their components . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the down@@ turn of inflation led the spec@@ ulation about a rise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England has warned that economic growth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; jobs will remain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they hold interest rates on family income in the midst of a strengthened print . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates on 0.@@ 25 % , whereby the weak economic growth has increased its support for an increase .
in her quarterly report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 on 1.@@ 7 % and for 2018 with 1.6 % , and warned that pressure on household income would likely be expected to rise to just under 3 % .
but they sign@@ alized that over the next few years Z@@ inser@@ tions would be necessary to bre@@ d the inflation of Bre@@ xit and she said that the credit cost may possibly be expected more than expected to the financial markets .
the members also voted to retreat a portion of the Mam@@ mut economic packages that was issued before a year after the Bre@@ xit .
it will demand time for finance plan to provide cheaper funding for banks , even though it is expected to make 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds of Sterling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; minutes after deciding on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the central progn@@ osis of the M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) will be weak in short notice because the pressure on the real income of the households will continue to use the consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the interest rates they repeated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain pen@@ dic@@ ation of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the cooling of inflation and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; somewhat greater &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extent would be needed than markets expect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the markets predi@@ ct the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the bank stressed that increases &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the growth forecasts of the Bank for this and next year are projected compared to the 1.9 % and 1.9 % compared to those in May .
it has maintained its growth forecast for 1.8 percent in 2018 .
the pound fell after these messages compared to the dollar and the euro .
the pounds fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.@@ 4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision to no change comes after the recent dis@@ appoint growth pay the rising expectations on a tick @-@ caves and GDP grew in the second quarter of 0.@@ 2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % .
the growth in the third quarter is expected to be 0.3 % , although it is easy to recover from the bank at the end of the year .
the youngest In@@ fl@@ ation@@ Report provided little enthusiasm for households , which will be affected by an increasing inflation and s@@ ligh@@ ten housing under@@ mining , as the shar@@ pen@@ ing will first get worse before it gets better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that monetary policy cannot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; preventing monetary policy in the next few years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but she added that wages are forecast at the end of their three @-@ year forecast &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is attributable to the weak pound to compens@@ ate for a part of lower consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision comes from a year after lowering interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % in the last August after the sho@@ cking EU vote which caused the sin@@ king of the body .
the Bank is estimated that it will take four years until this will reach the prizes and the economy .
before the last judgment of the bank to the interest rates , the reputation was increased after a raise , since inflation increased pressure on hard de@@ pressed households , with three political decision @-@ makers in July increased a rise to 0.5 % .
inflation is dropped last month by 2.9 % in June to 2,@@ 6 % , although the Bank said that this was expected and will continue to rise again in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said the crossing in relation to their goal of 2 % be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quite &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weak pound &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director at Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ ler Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the shorter back of the s@@ wap rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be more competitive again since the len@@ ders are looking to close to shops and end the year in a positive way .
the market looks particularly well for those who run the existing de@@ als and finish the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with toll free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( The National Health Service ) is intended to disp@@ enses with HIV @-@ drug 10.000 people
patients will receive access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV @-@ prevention treatment in September after a fight before the High Court against financing of the drug in N@@ HS .
N@@ HS England announced that one before the intercourse absorbed prevalence of proph@@ yla@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) , which can reduce the infection risk in high risk of around 86 percent , now being delivered by health service over a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he prepared to finance the process , after the Appe@@ al Court had confirmed a verdi@@ ct by the Supreme Court of Justice last year after that the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the Pr@@ EP despite the asser@@ tion that local authorities should finance him .
the chess statement presented on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England boss Simon Stev@@ ens as an &quot; important new intervention &quot; during the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) , as the &quot; decisive moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Brigh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be among the first to allow the registration of people , and further clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced in the whole of England in April 2018 .
prevention of proph@@ yla@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) is a result of HIV treatments which are taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that Pr@@ EP significantly reduced HIV @-@ transmission at infectious haz@@ ards .
cho@@ oses to take before intercourse means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection .
such medications can be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse .
those who come to ask for treatment are gay or bis@@ exual men , Trans@@ sexual and persons with HIV @-@ positive partners who were not successfully treated successfully .
in clinics , the participants agree that the study will agree , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status cannot be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy .
people who live in England and registered with a physician can also register for possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program will be £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract for delivery of the drugs in this week following an international competitive edge .
the study aims to assess the full potential of the Pr@@ EP by using clinical recei@@ pts , as it is used in a large scale , and is implemented in a large scale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should supplement the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevention HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of continuing progress in addressing one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deb@@ orah Gold , Chief Executive for NAT ( National Aids Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ EP when it is targeted at needy and vulnerable people , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from September to people with high HIV risk access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and not with a negotiation with a partner is subject to improving many , many lives .
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
Ian Green , CEO of Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the priority now must lie that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one that has a risk to HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now , since the Pr@@ EP test was created , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot;
Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , shadow @-@ health mini@@ stered in , said : &quot; the beginning of the Pr@@ EP process is welcome after monthly delays and hes@@ it@@ ant implementation through the government and over@@ due .
the evidence show how transforming this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to the understanding of the advantages of Pr@@ EP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is important that this study is done as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected HIV , and that they will contribute to the termination of the spread of HIV in society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the big life live : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment to a generous home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former banker with a passion for real estate , res@@ ized in 2014 by a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to Ear@@ ls Court apartment .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrasse - and it &apos;s a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne did not pack their pockets and sold .
&quot; before , I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; says Jo@@ anne .
&quot; I was looking for something that was comparable to my price .
this apartment was shown in Ear@@ ls Court and had the same high ceilings .
I love her in her and made an offer on that day . &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square meter has been completely rebuilt .
originally a one @-@ bedroom property with a wel@@ ded layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne storage space and a mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .
this was my request , &quot; she says .
for this purpose she studied architecture and Design@@ studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill , which was 12,@@ 5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not just a development but also a place to live for yod@@ elling .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms to place each other , so that the architectural challenge consisted in creating a mezzanine in which one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the issue .
&quot; the steel works is quite complicated , &quot; explains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were over@@ ed together without having to ask ourselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not just about building a simple platform , but to attach the steel so that it had the right amount for the function above or below . &quot;
this arrangement made it possible to place two rooms in full height - with much extra drama .
for the mezzanine you can see a classic coupling window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us via the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
Ges@@ pi@@ eg@@ ated Gold@@ van@@ ity , sil@@ ber@@ ne ac@@ z@@ ente and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting put the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theater , space and light .
at both ends , a short corridor is mir@@ r@@ ored to let him seem longer .
in the kitchen the mir@@ r@@ oring feel like a window into another room .
at the entrance we mir@@ r@@ ored units space for all cut@@ ters and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
due to the perception of a gl@@ am@@ our@@ less space , the beauty of the living room can shut the kitchen if it is not used .
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a wardrobe .
&quot; a bit of engineering went out , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel reinforced , vene@@ ered M@@ DF door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important , so it is when you slide the door very easily , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage box , Jo@@ anne could win extra 16 m ² , an extra bedroom and a improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the ground@@ floor - or how your property is estimated , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form will enter a real estate agent and perform a calculation based on the floor size . &quot;
here they have managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time use high quality materials , which give space to the room its luxurious advantage .
&quot; the materials are the things that you touch and who therefore help create an emotional li@@ aison in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; you do not love you into the electric so@@ ckets in the walls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square met@@ ers. of slightly default into something quite amazing .
in fact , as Jo@@ anne , you could decide to leave these not .
brothers are fighting for a 500 million US dollar property
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the Dynastie , in a confrontation of one of the largest real estate imperial and Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as worth over 500 million dollars .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton @-@ football @-@ Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . this made him the Supreme Court of Justice to clarify how their property and its business should be divided .
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 but a sharp debate about separation takes place in the Supreme Court of Justice .
together with her mother Anna have collected the brothers 38 properties in value of more than half a billion dollars , since the family has since 1973 bought a shop in Smith Street , Col@@ ling@@ wood .
there the family West@@ co Je@@ ans founded it and grew up to a chain of 160 retail outlets .
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis now covers offices in the city centre , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt . Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the subur@@ ban .
according to an agreement with her late father , Col@@ in - by Paul as &quot; main operators and the dominant personality , &quot; described in the family De Lu@@ tis - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third .
a judicial record is that this means that Col@@ in is owned by 3@@ 16 million dollars and Paul valued at the value of 17@@ 6 million dollars .
the distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul as a problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the distribu@@ tions proposed by Col@@ in proposed him with what I held for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he wrote in a first Aff@@ id@@ av@@ it in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place on the last Friday .
the brothers are now fighting for control over the existing business - of which Paul asser@@ ted , as Paul asser@@ ted him out .
Col@@ in argued , this was not true , but thro@@ ws Paul in front of managing some possessions in@@ competent .
in an early Aff@@ id@@ av@@ it , which was filed by Col@@ in , he said he hope to enter the dispute .
&quot; my Italian heritage wrote that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote .
the costs rise in the case , with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports of companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck C@@ ram@@ er , and with leading lawyers , including All@@ an My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and from both sides reserved law firms .
Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her late Luigi were Italian immigrants who were operated in milk bars and delicacies from the late 1950 @-@ years and bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick .
they used the security to buy the Col@@ ling@@ wood property , in the Col@@ in the first Je@@ ans@@ load of the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Col@@ in says that he began West@@ co there when he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in my last years of high school , when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in the year 2012 , hoped to pass their ownership to her sons .
&quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted to land the brothers before judgment , &quot; she wrote .
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis group , with Col@@ in asser@@ ted that Mark paid to $ 10 million and Luke 26 million dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark are , so Paul , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Paul &quot; about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in has very backward , although he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography of the year 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of the TV Icon .
Fair@@ fax Media took contact with Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their attor@@ neys .
only Col@@ in answered by SMS to say &quot; I can really not say much , &quot; because the case before the courts be .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very , very sorry that my brother Paul has decided to disgu@@ ise me and to go to our sur@@ name by the dishes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of 2016 Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father did not have known that Paul and I would end up in our current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still hope for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our matter will be solved in the near future by the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Col@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tru@@ mp@@ s new staff member is planning to restrict the media ab@@ st@@ in@@ ence of the President .
others have tried and have failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
pol@@ tico reports that the new staff of the White House is planning to restrict the information flow to President Tru@@ mp , including the reports of the news media - in hope to keep the boss on a uniform course .
here is a piece of re@@ porter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new staff member of the White House , conven@@ ed on his first working day , he introduced a main problem in President Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s White House , which he would repair : poor information that fall into the hands of the President .
Kelly said the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in let@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot;
wa@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others tries to en@@ umer@@ ate Tru@@ mp by monitoring its media control .
President Tru@@ mp@@ s relationship with television reaches decades - and now where he is in the White House is still strong .
&quot; when candidate Tru@@ mp was angry because of an un@@ fair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received a fair report of places that were to convince , &quot; said the former electoral consultant Sam Nun@@ berg in February toward pol@@ tico .
Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote to the time that &quot; the key to hold Tru@@ mp@@ s Twitter custom under control , according to six former electoral campaign officials to ensure that its personal media use a ste@@ am@@ eless praise . &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tru@@ mp@@ s Twitter has ever been &quot; under control &quot; is ridic@@ ulous .
perhaps this campaign might know something that we don &apos;t know other - that Tru@@ mp@@ s T@@ we@@ ets would have even more igni@@ tion .
we will probably never know something about the twe@@ ets that Tru@@ mp has not sent .
if his associates didn &apos;t manage it several times , anger , anger of him , then their efforts have been worthwhile .
but nobody has been able to prevent Tru@@ mp Contro@@ ll@@ ers .
part of the problem is that people in a White House that advocates from competing parties , always trying to present their own agenda by promoting Tru@@ mp material that may help their views from the world .
Poli@@ tico - quite busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of the consultants , the president for strategic reasons beyond doubt .
this was an example that was described by Re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former Tru@@ mp @-@ officials say that Tru@@ mp can react like a volcano on negative press @-@ cuts , especially those with damaged le@@ aks , and that he will get out of it from where these originate .
exactly this happened at the end of February , when someone called mal@@ icious a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet Prov@@ ok@@ ate@@ urs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the dep@@ uty staff at K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; the source behind a bunch of le@@ aks to be in the White House .
although Johnson was banned from Twitter , or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he has expressed false accus@@ ations in the past and has taken them revoke .
Tru@@ mp read the article and began to ask staff about Wal@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ macher added that the former staff of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Tru@@ mp &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly tries three months later to do the same .
perhaps he will prove to prove more effective manager as pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tru@@ mp is still his own self @-@ self , and his advis@@ ers still strive for influence .
these un@@ changing factors make a mission very difficult .
Master searched crimin@@ als get post by Euro@@ pol
as the address is unknown , the inclusion of the population is praying and up@@ lifted .
the police in all Europe ma@@ iled this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards to dangerous crimin@@ als on the run .
since the addresses of the requested sword @-@ bre@@ eder nature are not known , references from the population are raised and praying .
Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the action , following the &quot; EU Most W@@ anted &quot; Advent calendar following the winter season .
the experiences had shown that many sm@@ oul@@ try to hide holiday homes , it meant by Euro@@ pol .
you have put together 21 post@@ cards for selected crimin@@ als from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 it has been the website www.@@ eu@@ mo@@ st@@ allion , more than 2.5 million times this was regarded .
36 of the online files could be arrested until now , at least eleven thereof due to references to the publication on the website .
travellers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return back to &apos; million@@ aires @-@ Series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home @-@ owner of the West Mid@@ lands are back with some resol@@ ute travelers on war fu@@ sions , which have been negotiated by the municipality of zo@@ omed to reg@@ ain a field in front of their man@@ sions .
the travellers have called their 20 caravan on a field outside a prosper@@ ous road of Soli@@ h@@ ull , which is called the &quot; million@@ aires . &quot;
they have brought horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters after they were rejected only in May , without having been stretched out by one by the Council of buried dit@@ ch to prevent their objection .
the tac@@ tical group found a gap in the defense units and dra@@ gged their vehicles through a section which remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; fur@@ ious residents have afflic@@ ted the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull , who said it is &quot; useless &quot; to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an anonymous inhabitants said , &quot; They are moved there on Monday , after they were sent from Bentley He@@ ath where they threw stones on the pass@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council needs to be forced by shame to implement in action as it was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the travellers were there in May , they were moved and are now back .
more came yesterday evening , probably today more . &quot;
she added : &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to deal with it by holding long sub@@ missions to protect their parks .
I live on the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to continue to pay my similarities , if the Council cannot stop it . &quot;
a local who did not want to be called , said , &quot; It is ridic@@ ulous , we just saw the last round of this trav@@ eller , just to pl@@ under@@ ed from another round .
the figures have increased this time and you have even seen a horse in the parking area . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ person of the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are aware of an unauthorized camp on the country beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to move them as soon as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to support our mo@@ tions collection , it is very important that as many inhabitants sign an anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police by calling 101 by calling 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this helps to create an image of the situation in which the court must check when we present our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Birken@@ hof , Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise becomes Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Birken@@ hof the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is born .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts is currently renovated and will be re@@ opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closure of the hotel Birken@@ hof through the then ambience operating company mbH to 13 April 2014 , the time of about 30 000 nights went lost per year and also recei@@ pts by the city tax .
in the autumn of 2014 , in the face of dramatic numbers of refugees , the hotel building was offered , the hotel building was offered as a collective accommodation , which was provided for controversy of controversy .
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by placing an illustration plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was then not un@@ controversial at that time .
but above all Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts Ober@@ bourgeois Julian Os@@ s@@ wald defended the hotel location , and spoke at that time of serious interested parties in the house .
he should reserve the right .
the Group Lu@@ isen@@ ster with chair@@ men Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer , with seat in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern has acquired the former Hotel Birken@@ hof in a voluntary auction house in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of three @-@ star Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städter object four houses .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Men &apos;s .
you are called Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the former Hotel Birken@@ hof have been building a long period before the entrance , and when you enter the house , it becomes clear , what extensive renov@@ ations will be carried out .
the so@@ ils have turned out , blankets and ceilings built , old bath@@ tu@@ bs from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
until March there is still much to do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is actually a lovely place , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
everything is supposed to be renewed in the Black style .
the rooms are equipped with large covered showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , there will be new windows installed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything sol@@ le later &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice bourgeois close &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make a piece of gem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room are among the equipment .
one would not want to position itself on the high level of hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bath , but already on a up@@ scale downtown , empha@@ si@@ sts .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to spread wide , explains Sch@@ erer .
both individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business@@ men should feel at home at the hotel .
talks with whether Julian Os@@ s@@ wald and Tourism dire@@ ktor Michael Kr@@ ause already led , so Sh@@ erer .
the ideas of the city are covered with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
after the amount of investment in demand , Thomas Sch@@ erer does not want to specify exactly .
just under a million euros , he expects .
also the outdoor facilities are brought in front , that is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard there is a large terrace which is open from the restaurant , which is open to public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ affair : us @-@ Special En@@ er@@ man sets the Grand Jury
in the Russia @-@ affair about US @-@ president Donald Tru@@ mp is supposed to have appointed a so @-@ called Grand Jury in Russia according to a report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the body included the work in recent weeks wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on appeal to the cause of confidential persons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the paper shows the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller expands and intensified its investigation .
the CN@@ N Sender , it already announces the first pres@@ et of the Gre@@ mi@@ um in connection with a meeting between Tru@@ mp@@ s oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
us intelligence services accused the Kre@@ m@@ lin since longer , specifically mixed up in the presidential election in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller examines whether there were agreements between Tru@@ mp@@ s electoral campaign and Moscow .
in the focus of investigations , several men shall stand , who acted in the election campaign as a consultant of the Re@@ public@@ ans .
according to reports , Mu@@ eller also took more and more Tru@@ mp@@ s private and business environment among the magni@@ fying glass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the Sonder@@ er@@ mitt@@ ler Tru@@ mp was personally engaged in the centre and looking for the accus@@ ation if the President may have disabled people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys is to examine and decide the present evidence in possible inter@@ rup@@ tions and to decide whether the indictment is to be ex@@ al@@ ted .
Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore also called counts .
mostly they are turned on when it comes to bigger and controversy .
the procedure is always behind closed doors .
the Panel can also be turned on by the prosec@@ utor to load persons to con@@ gregate under E@@ id .
according to the transmitter CN@@ N , pre @-@ inv@@ itations were already issued , which revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tru@@ mp J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
individuals who were involved in the meeting would be encouraged to a statement , was it in the report .
furthermore , they should provide documents .
aside from Tru@@ mp J@@ r. were also Tru@@ mp@@ s consultants and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner as well as his dam@@ an election director Paul Man@@ a@@ fort at the interview .
right @-@ wing per@@ ten said on Thursday night on the US television , that the composition show that Mu@@ eller would not be shy in his work and that he should be necessary to act fast .
but it must not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will end on the end to decide on the survey of an accus@@ ation .
nevertheless , the composition of the body was the beginning of a new phase in the studies and a new cause for President Tru@@ mp .
in the midst of the new revelations , the President on Thursday night held a speech in West Virginia to portra@@ y the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the theme gives the Democrats a way to feel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feeling good because they have nothing else to talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special consultant T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in an opinion , he does not know anything from the composition of a grand jury .
but these also usually work in the secret , he stressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the White House feared all actions that accelerated the work of the special agent in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former F@@ BI boss James Com@@ ey has told three times that is not determined against the President .
you have no reason to believe that something has changed in it , it was in the explanation .
Mu@@ eller was only used after Tru@@ mp Com@@ ey had been frozen .
because of this re@@ vocation , accus@@ ations against Tru@@ mp were loud , he made the judiciary hin@@ der .
Com@@ ey said in June before a Senate Committee , Tru@@ mp have asked him for an outlook for investigations against the former national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ ynn .
the president is under great pressure due to the investigation .
after the presentation of US media , the White House gathered material against the special er@@ mitt@@ ler and its employees .
the extingu@@ ish spec@@ ulation about whether Tru@@ mp Mu@@ eller was released .
different from an independent special event of Congress , as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate Aff@@ aires following the later President Richard Ni@@ x@@ on , Mu@@ eller has folded a position in which he theoretically could be folded at D@@ rän@@ gen of the President of the President of Justice .
but several sen@@ ators of both parties want to bend such a step but to bow .
two groups of Republi@@ can and democratic transm@@ itters presented on Thursday law@@ ns which could no longer be released so easily .
Ant@@ arctic : giant ic@@ eberg drives in the Ant@@ arc@@ tica
in the West@@ ant@@ ark@@ tis , a giant ic@@ eberg was solved by the almost seven size of Berlin from Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is .
this divided the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ We@@ gener @-@ Institut für Polar - und Marine Studies on Wednesday .
the more than a tri@@ l@@ lion tons of heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometers large pist@@ on drives now to the north and will probably be two , three years until he mel@@ ted .
it is with 175 kilometers of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres one of the largest ic@@ eberg that researchers have registered over the past three decades .
a danger to human beings does not go out of him .
to what extent of climate change has played a role in the collapse of the ic@@ eberg , is unclear after research .
in total , however , there have been a series of unusual inter@@ rup@@ ts of ice cream in the region for about 30 years , writes the US @-@ research center for snow and ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a fact@@ sheet .
according to many researchers , this could hang together with the heating of heating .
the now broken col@@ oss had so far been part of Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is .
Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is swi@@ ms on the sea and is fed by large gl@@ aci@@ ers .
it continues to grow in the sea and continues to break on a regular basis .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is located south of South America almost at the top of the Ant@@ arctic peninsula .
North of this shot was the balance of wa@@ xes and ab@@ ort was disturbed few years ago .
a complete Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ i be there , writes AW@@ I @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
I &apos;m talking about that also the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is in danger , for the front edges have never been withdrawn as far as currently .
in addition , the ice plate is under stress and could fall , if at a key point , one piece is down .
the mel@@ ting of Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is and ic@@ eberg increases the sea level , as they swim on the water and pushed ice as much water as it results in the mel@@ ting itself .
however , the loss of shame is that the gl@@ aci@@ ers can flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before .
this could possibly increase the sea level , but only in low dimensions , the British research project writes to the observation of the Ant@@ arc@@ tica ( MI@@ DAS ) .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is according to AW@@ I @-@ data with almost 50 000 square kilometres , the fourth for@@ el@@ fe@@ is of the Ant@@ arc@@ tica .
at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front @-@ edge to the free ocean about 200 meters .
there it will be regularly off .
&quot; although it is a natural happening and has no direct connection to climate change , the ic@@ king now comes into a dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British Sw@@ an@@ sea University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the greatest retreat since the beginning of the records , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confirmed he also . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among scientists be controversial , whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is now to grow again or long run and possibly together , his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last decades .
even though these researchers have not rec@@ eded the demo@@ lition of this gigantic Eis@@ berg not on climate change , so in recent decades a lot of ice mel@@ ts of the Ant@@ arctic peninsula occurred .
this long ornamental of the Ant@@ arctic extends towards South America .
according to data from the British Ant@@ arctic Survey , the ice @-@ surface of the Ant@@ arctic Peninsula has declined since the 195@@ 0s around 28 000 square kilometres .
to decrease I had contributed to the temperature .
the Ant@@ arctic peninsula has grown in the past 50 years by around three degrees and nar@@ rati@@ ves to the areas where the temperature at the fastest sti@@ ge .
CD@@ U wants Hau@@ star@@ if at the staff
because it becomes more and more difficult to occupy fre@@ est@@ al places , the CD@@ U demands out of the employer association , to become more attractive .
only shortly before the summer break , the K@@ rei@@ day opened 41 new jobs in the administration .
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the county administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now you have got 17 appren@@ tices their first working day behind him .
the teachers at the circle are apparently very popular .
some 6@@ 20 applications were to be found for the places this year .
nevertheless , the circle is missing further personnel in order to be able to cope with the sc@@ ended requirements and tasks .
at present , there are at the circle of M@@ ett@@ mann still 50 not occupied places .
among other things doctors and engineers and the forces of general administration are sought .
the CD@@ U now wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG to take the initiative and to enter the skilled tem@@ angel in administration .
the administration is to develop a concept for personnel recovery and personnel development after the desire of the parties . &quot;
the aim is to cover not only for short @-@ term needs , but future @-@ oriented of the applicants , it means .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the overall concept should be oriented towards the inside and extern@@ ally , concrete measures for cross @-@ cat@@ ers and involve an educational background , call CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this already sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has it to do with personal problems , which you had not known before .
other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive terms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is from a regular &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of the public employer &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , a high number of employees comes to divor@@ ce the disease or age @-@ conditioned by the service .
so it is high time for action so that no more places remain un@@ occupied .
however , Klaus @-@ Dieter peoples , leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the common application with his party .
he had long ago been in the start of the day for a lazy surprise when he asked the personnel management publicly into question and the rest of the parties were stun@@ ned .
people want all the possibilities to be checked that allow a withdrawal from the municipal employer association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do not come to a satisfactory solution here at short notice , the county administration with the unions - perhaps also seek in cooperation with the county @-@ nation@@ als of the cities - such as peoples &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this , the CD@@ U attempts to pay the employees and officials better than it actually sees the tari@@ ffs for public service .
the sal@@ aries are currently precisely prescribed , enhancements or more money there is only if you change in a higher stage that is oriented to professional years .
however , the tasks of the circle has grown more and more in recent years .
only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up in which the provisions of the new pro@@ stitutes Act had to take care of .
last but not least by the rising number of asylum seekers , County Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ dire@@ ktor Martin Richter a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy exac@@ erb@@ ated the sound too NGO @-@ migrants @-@ ambul@@ ance
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has NGOs to put the lif@@ ebo@@ ards for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they cannot continue this if they do not hold new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if NGOs don &apos;t sign up a new Code of Conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , &quot; said Interior of Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Tur@@ iner daily La St@@ amp@@ a .
Min@@ niti@@ s warning came a day after the Italian authorities had conf@@ is@@ cated a boat for the German aid organisation &apos; Youth R@@ eci@@ ally , because their crew collabor@@ ated effectively with men &apos;s hands in a way that ligh@@ tened illegal immigration .
the aid organisation that has only been in operation for one year , it refused to express the detailed demonstration of the Italian public prosec@@ utor Amb@@ ro@@ gio Cart@@ osi@@ o .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us and remains the salvation of human life our top priority . so we are sorry that we can &apos;t operate at the moment in the search and rescue zone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organization in an opinion on social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only judge all accus@@ ations that are currently raised , after we have collected all the information and we can judge the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had the boat of &apos; Youth R@@ eci@@ pes &apos; , the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , supervised since October .
it is thought that his crew will take hose migrants to board that can be delivered directly by human resources , and that the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gler can be used so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting was alle@@ ge@@ dly only 1,3 miles in front of the Libyan coast , according to the acts of the Public Pro@@ sec@@ utor , the content of Italian media was published .
the crew will susp@@ ects himself over the authority of the Italian coastal guard , rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other moti@@ fs .
under the Code of Conduct , boats such as the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta above all have an Italian police officers on board that monitors their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have previously prepared to keep themselves in the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable , since they would not bring any &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; significant changes or disabilities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of their b@@ ail@@ out actions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refuse to sign , is the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate organisation doctors without borders ( MS@@ F ) .
Minn@@ iti now said that the number of migrants that had gone down after the rescue operations in Italy , in the last few weeks , suggest@@ ing that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast and carried the cooperation with the local citizens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days we started to see light at the end of the tunnel &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he gave plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month on economic development initiatives and with Ch@@ ad , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants that have left these countries in hope to reach Europe .
ascent and Tri@@ als
nine W@@ eil@@ er@@ mer bikers , the &quot; Berlin out@@ post &quot; and two host @-@ drivers met in the North of Wach@@ en@@ heim in order to enjoy four days of tri@@ als and sights .
there were three be@@ ck@@ ener guides available for this .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heim valley proved to be a good starting point for tours .
the castle and W@@ einf@@ est of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour conducted during hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim .
it followed view@@ points , partly on towers , of which one could look far above the Pf@@ alz forest and the advanced levels .
in between in between there were always longer periods of asc@@ ents for the long tri@@ als .
on the second day there went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and the folk @-@ firm saus@@ age market .
again view point at the viewpoint , connected by &quot; flo@@ or@@ ge &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents .
on the last two days there were many al@@ timeter again .

console instead of lawn - Bundesliga ge@@ aring up for e @-@ sport
sit the sport stars in future in front of computer consoles , instead of fighting with wind and weather over the amaz@@ ement race ?
fact is : e @-@ Sport has long since become a serious industry , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gar@@ ages .
they have also recognized the first Bundes@@ land@@ aver@@ aged , who are increasingly engaged in this field .
in the beginning of 2015 the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later followed the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , founded in the middle of July a e @-@ sports department and two professionals for the computer game of FIFA 17 under contract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to inspire new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Board of Jochen R@@ ött@@ cher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure that there are several associations on this move . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next weekend , the Football World Association FIFA in London organized the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; in which the gam@@ ers of various clubs compete against each other .
beside Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg have qualified for example Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven .
also Robin Dut@@ y looks great potential in the E @-@ Sport .
the Ex @-@ Trainer of Bayer Lever@@ k@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen now advis@@ es a agency for virtual football players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real football must deal in particular with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ old , that young people will still go to the stadium in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : the clubs were trying to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian .
with prominent e @-@ sports@@ men under contract one could be much more often present on these markets than once a year to send back to Asia .
what is it exactly ?
at the E @-@ Sport , computer games like &quot; League Of Le@@ gends , &quot; D@@ ot@@ A 2 , &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or just the football simulation of FIFA on competitive level .
long ago , as in normal sports , are well established , in which the professionals compete against each other .
and in the Asian region E @-@ Sport is already part of the official program .
but is it a real sport ?
for many , the performance is safe .
In@@ go F@@ seals has long been dealt with the question for a long time .
for the professor at the German Spor@@ tho@@ chschule in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because it is un@@ peti@@ tive and many biological and physical reactions show that one can also find in classic sports - for example increased heart frequency , stress operations , hormonal changes .
furthermore , there are cognitive abilities , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a fast response ability .
professional gam@@ ers should not only train at the console , but also train their body and pay attention to the diet .
&quot; the middle player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it also sees problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doping is becoming more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls are difficult for play in online games , and in the scene , the structures of the classic sport .
positive highlights the scientists providing the high @-@ inclusive effect of the E @-@ Sports .
the players are international , this is like a big global family , there is no cross @-@ cultural barriers .
a study of corporate consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association of Inter@@ aktive Entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) says the e @-@ sport a rapid growth ahead .
in 2016 , it has been implemented in Germany 50 million euros , primarily on advertising , sponsor@@ ing and great tournaments .
sales will be at 130 million in three years .
against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the football Bundesliga this is little .
however , the e @-@ sport &quot; was not far away from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice @-@ ho@@ ckey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte consultants .
international are many countries already further .
major markets are Asia and the USA where ex @-@ basketball player Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez will participate in the U.S. Team NR@@ G .
Hollywood actor Ashton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in e@@ sport @-@ Wett@@ provider Uni@@ kr@@ n .
also in Europe is doing a lot .
in a Norwegian school E @-@ Sport has been introduced as a teaching , says F@@ rob@@ ous .
in the Netherlands and in France the football @-@ premiere of football @-@ associations according to Dut@@ y are now committed to set up an e @-@ sports department .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in European comparison with Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B @-@ Board R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only in nostal@@ gia to fall , and the ancient times to clear , is no longer sufficient .
it &apos;s about keeping the tradition of the association but to align the company at the same time on the modern market .
&quot; we live in a digi@@ tised world , &quot; says Dut@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is not one thing to keep in mind that only in football everything remains as it was always . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michelle Carter because of the lyrics , the Con@@ rad Roy to su@@ icide , condemned
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because they encouraged their friend through texts and calls to su@@ icide .
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind guitar and five years ago were exposed on trial .
Carter was sentenced in June due to the neg@@ ligent killing of Con@@ rad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 .
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is un@@ comfor@@ ting .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to remain free until the appeal .
she had been faced with a maximum of 20 years , but their legal representations have argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness .
dressed in red p@@ ants and a cream colored leaf , Carter stood with tears in the eyes , with folded hands and down @-@ oriented eyes when it was condemned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their actions have turned to Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she finished his life to make her own better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it has not assumed responsibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has shown no repentance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ters attorney said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful circum@@ stance that it is completely de@@ plor@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said however , he did not find out that their &quot; age or maturity or even their spiritual disease have a significant impact on their actions . &quot;
a prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys mother Lyn@@ n Roy , the said that there is no day in which I pray not the loss of my beloved Son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want he proud of me and how I am going with everything . I try , despite all my pain , which we will carry with us for eternity with us , for his sisters there is to be there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she will be pursued by the knowledge , &quot; that they will never be participating in the wedding of her brother or would be an a@@ unt for his children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not to have this single person with whom I was together every day since my birth , is a pain that I will always keep in my life for the rest of my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent , since there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to commit to another , su@@ icide .
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in a vehicle in 2014 .
the case moved national attention to itself after Car@@ ters &apos;s text messages reveal that she encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hanging out of a building , ste@@ eping yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said in several news that she sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the moments before his su@@ icide , she wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must do it , Con@@ rad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All you need to do is to turn the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter was looking for attention by the death of Roy , and ord@@ ained that by any press they profit from the case .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
among the few who defended Carter , Amanda Kno@@ x , which was sentenced to Italy because of the murder of her British room@@ mate in Italy before they were released two years ago .
Mrs. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published in the Los Angeles Times a comment : &quot; Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ ber@@ me : learning from the new Mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua was allowed to walk at the Audi Cup as captain captain , is no coincidence .
the FC Bayern tr@@ aut the Con@@ fed Cup winner for a great season - Extra motivation is not ground@@ ed .
anything else was different at his place in the cabin , who saw Joshua felt immediately , even if the additional piece of clothing was very , very small .
but there is far and wide at the second day of Audi C@@ ups of course no Philipp Lah@@ m and also no Manuel Neu@@ er to see he made himself the holding bin@@ der on the arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trainer has not announced it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; told the Con@@ fed Cup winner , after his first use as a Bavaria captain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
well , the one could have been better run than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the sign from the coach was able to interpret it as well .
not the eight year older Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al was in the out of youth playful , de@@ ath@@ ants and just selected from the holidays of the pros existing C @-@ El@@ f as a game leader , but he .
su@@ gar@@ s , one so@@ ak up in the de@@ ar@@ est to those who you want to keep a lot that one wants to hold at av@@ une .
those who have been cold , the heritage of Lah@@ m can be found , a small extra motivation can only be good .
Kim@@ me confirmed : &quot; this is what you want as a player : to take on responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday fl@@ ashing of 22 @-@ year @-@ old as mini @-@ Lah@@ m over the field .
right behind , that is now his position , the white bin@@ der on the arm did its rest .
and at all , Kim@@ ber@@ me in this starting formation like the one who can take the rod best into the hand .
he gave instructions , tried to ste@@ er the un@@ played tro@@ upe .
he had the view of the whole , while many others were busy with himself .
Vid@@ al therefore , his lack of fitness to over@@ play ( folding ) ; Renato San@@ ches thus , to establish on the devil of the Asia @-@ journey ( folding also only partly ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le thus , in their first appearance in Bavaria @-@ jer@@ sey do not fall into negative .
and all the fold out quite well .
Sü@@ le ran beside Kim@@ me , Rud@@ y in front of the defense , both agile sovereign .
the well @-@ occupied Napoli @-@ storm did often work hard , in addition , they tried to succeed in the game building a few times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his colleague Rud@@ y was too that the result was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not as we have hoped for us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but even he showed a decent performance at the debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; gameplay shift , temp@@ o change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this style I was also fet@@ ched . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as un@@ used this Bavaria is still for the new accessible , one looked after the game .
Rud@@ y for example was in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs not one or two , but determined six or seven interviews .
Kim@@ me looked after a few cris@@ p statements in the back of his new fellow @-@ players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there he heard an interesting phrase from Sü@@ le : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is going on here I have already noticed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Bavaria you just need to win every game . &quot;
after all , he does not have to teach the new ones .

it often worked irre@@ conc@@ il@@ ably , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) nor economic mini@@ ster@@ ers of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
this is after more than one year , in which the new economic minister Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak on T V request from a change in economic policy - and bl@@ acks at the same time the old prime minister .
Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association Tri@@ erer ( V@@ TU ) says : &quot; Wis@@ sing acc@@ esses the wishes of the economy that Lem@@ ke has blocked all the Lem@@ on . &quot;
the biggest turn@@ around doesn &apos;t see Nat@@ us in the infrastructure policy : the brid@@ ging of the highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au stands in the Pri@@ or &apos;s list of the country at the top of the country .
yet this year the Ministry is hoping for a plan process , up to 2021 is intended to stand up @-@ to @-@ date .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a role in the plans of the country also plays the Western &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Western &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Trier , which is in the most urgent need for the Federal Office . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal is to take the route in December 2020 in operation , says mini@@ stries of Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
Nat@@ us looks at it a sign for regional , but internationally competitive companies .
the Chamber of Commerce of Commerce ( I@@ HK ) Trier continues to be prompted by Wis@@ sing , at the wine a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pf@@ alz label to increase the paragraph in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German wine exports for ten years .

Audi is supposed to change 85@@ 0.000 diesel vehicles - auto @-@ autom@@ akers are faced with a bac@@ kl@@ ash .
one day prior to the announcement of Audi said BMW that it would offer to update the software in over 35@@ ,000 vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the BMW Group said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company is the opinion that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intelligent options are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited options &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and related to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - diesel vehicles to offer or restrict . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described business as a recall .
European automobile manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions .
but the nitrogen oxi@@ des , the diesel engines are regarded as car@@ cin@@ o@@ gens and can cause as@@ thma .
the cost of the automobile manufacturers , equipment for neutr@@ alization of diesel vehicles can be installed and also take into account what makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s also indi@@ cted to ignore the powerful automobile companies and ignore signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the errors of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called de@@ preci@@ ation devices that regul@@ ates emissions if a car was tested , but with normal driving conditions .
in the United States several employees were charged by Volkswagen , others are investigated on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former Head of Ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ics was arrested in Germany in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Zac@@ ch@@ eo Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Italian and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be put to court in the United States .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations , after the authorities have accused , a system installed to deal with the emissions rules in Europe and a request that was concentrated on the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the inclusion of Audi in the investigation could strain Volkswagen heavy : the luxury car manufacturer is over@@ proportional to the winning of Volkswagen .

lav@@ ender from Provence is threatened by climate change
he has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change .
the lav@@ ender is due to the adher@@ ence to dro@@ ught conditions and because of the disease @-@ borne insects distor@@ ts what scientists and farmers trying to find solutions , great head@@ aches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the agr@@ arian Institute of CRI@@ EP@@ P@@ AM in Provence , said : &quot; the Lav@@ ender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to climate change over the past few years , which in spring has brought much less rain and in autumn a lot more .
this has an impact on the life of lav@@ ender .
there is also a small dial , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium that bears the d@@ warf @-@ c@@ ades , and with very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is a lot on the game .
lav@@ ender oil lo@@ wered not only for vac@@ ation@@ ers , it is also highly appreciated for perf@@ ume and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having very long plant breeding with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , UN@@ TER@@ EN@@ TW@@ IC@@ TE and either missing or weak@@ ened .
so we have fewer parts with etheric oil . &quot;
among the solutions that are considered to be considered a better water distribution and slow@@ down of the distor@@ tion of the soil , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mixture of sound and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dr@@ y@@ ness .

the assass@@ ination of a journalist empha@@ sizes the growing threat in Mexico
the staff of the Weekly Rio@@ do@@ ce is usually meeting to check their plans for reporting the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt official and ceas@@ eless drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of her own tragedy , they came together to speak about security .
it was told to them that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ level journalists discuss what are safer to feel : they should take their children to the office who were the aim of a attack with granite , or they leave them at home .
security experts have written three words on a plate on the front of the room : opponents , neutral , allies .
you ask the re@@ porter to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary , percep@@ tions and abdom@@ en .
there are drugs regul@@ ators , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are susp@@ ects , on the pav@@ ement list of the government or cart@@ els , a catalog of crimin@@ als that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no rest of violence , and while in the whole country has led the corp@@ ses , more and more journalists at least 25 , since President En@@ rique Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to have joined in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are standing by attacks and threats under federal protection and until now there were at least seven deaths in seven countries this year .
among the latter is its editors and her inspiration from Rio@@ do@@ ce , the co @-@ founder of Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest error is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence will be deep recep@@ tive , although its presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Val@@ dez , which shows his mid @-@ finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hanging on the façade of the Rio@@ do@@ ce building . two re@@ por@@ ters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ barra and Miri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez , bear t @-@ shirts , which show its ridic@@ ulous face with glasses or its typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ porter discuss their shared themes , the trau@@ ma , their night@@ mar@@ es , ins@@ om@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although 2010 has been a Son@@ der Bundes@@ an@@ Bar , in order to process the cases of journalists , this according to the Committee for the Protection of journalists only introduced two criminal proceedings .
as with most thousands of Mor@@ den , which are connected with drug outlets and organised crime each year , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely placed before judgment .
at Rio@@ do@@ ce , they still insist on to treat the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a although they are un@@ comfor@@ ting , and even though the terrain is still tra@@ ded .
without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting in the discussion of security is little benefits , says I@@ barra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very fool@@ ish to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says he . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we do not know why , mi@@ str@@ ust we all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Rio@@ do@@ ce in the provincial capital of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
he just managed to drive a few blocks away before his rot@@ er Toyota Cor@@ olla was arrested by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , pres@@ um@@ ably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; T@@ wel@@ ded flow . &quot;
the scor@@ er went away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two grown @-@ up children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an freely .
but on the topic Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ mans arrest in the past year and the delivery into the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a became one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , since ri@@ val@@ ing political groups are fighting here to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day anyone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery full is full of two @-@ story mouse @-@ ole@@ to for drug royal that are larger than many houses for the living .
forget for a minute that there is a state of rest assured if only one cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes to the United States .
nevertheless and despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Rio@@ do@@ ce , with the guilt also broken that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings have contributed to the murder .
at first , in February the publication of an interview with Dam@@ as@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the ri@@ val@@ ing cart@@ els in war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
this publication may have anno@@ yed the sons , suspected of gang@@ sters bought every copy of the output as soon as they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ke .
the second error was to force Val@@ dez not to force the same story after the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper , which had published the same story to leave the country for its own safety .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and its kill@@ ings is regarded as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues knew that he would always be there .
he was active as an experienced re@@ porter for Nor@@ o@@ este as he joined together with five colleagues for the creation of Rio@@ do@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars .
in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to operate journalism , without reaching the anti @-@ d@@ ow@@ ry problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
with the time the newspaper has earned a reputation because of the coura@@ geous and honest coverage , and the turnover and advertising .
re@@ por@@ ters loved it to publish hard @-@ hearted examinations without fear of cens@@ or@@ ship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories , which no one otherwise dar@@ ed to treat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; eight years after the establishment of Rio@@ do@@ ce she received the prestigious &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prize &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for its coverage in Latin America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same year Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drugs history , wherever they lead .
he gave voluntarily to that he was afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to continue to live , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; drug trading in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a lifestyle , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento TV in October last October . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you need to take the task that you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what did you do in the face of so many dead ... why did you not say what went before ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Rio@@ do@@ ce team mis@@ ses Val@@ dez , the Spa@@ ak @-@ bird , who was like a port @-@ worker , the friend , the generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher , who knew how to survive .
you trusted on his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
he would always travel to El Guay@@ abo , the bar across from the office , and always sit at the same table .
now they wonder : was his love for routine his destruction ?
his death has also comp@@ elled them to ask her own assumptions on how to do their work best and stay alive .
&quot; they don &apos;t like it if you are dealing with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their secret start@@ up and run@@ ways , &quot; to employ drugs .
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even at the best times , a high level of self @-@ cens@@ or@@ ship and self @-@ suffici@@ ency .
to trust his own inst@@ inc@@ ts .
if it smells wrong , stay away from it .
the anger is , said the editor of Rio@@ do@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real that &apos; smell has a sense that can be d@@ anced ... and then the thing happens with Javier . &quot;
the old rules , as he and others said , are not considered in Sin@@ alo@@ a no more - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a poison@@ ous mix of lu@@ cr@@ ative s@@ mu@@ g@@ ative s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling , weak institutions and corrupt governmental forces at home .
the landscape changes constantly .
in the room where the employees of Rio@@ do@@ ce met for security training , suddenly there were no mobile phones . days previously became known that Spy@@ ware that is sold exclusively to governments for monitoring journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside two polic@@ emen protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .
they were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Rio@@ do@@ ce in a four @-@ story building in a mid @-@ class quarter of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
half in the joke , some of the re@@ por@@ ters asked themselves whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the police officers , who drew the governor himself as a trusted .
it is months since the re@@ por@@ ters have gone into the mountain landscape , where the drug gangs de facto under control .
for the issue of this week Rio@@ do@@ ce has caught up three main stories .
it gave the assass@@ ination of the fraction of the former known box@@ ers Ju@@ lio Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an ex@@ pos@@ é to the government spending , concentrated on the hom@@ etown of the governor .
and there was a group that led in one of the most expensive restaurants in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an , one block from the office of the prosec@@ utor , a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about who has been kidn@@ apped or how it came to pass , so caution was offered to write as it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite restaurant on drug dealers and authorities .
a re@@ por@@ ters from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician , who ruled the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( Pr@@ i ) which ruled almost all political levels almost all .
recently several Pr@@ i @-@ Govern@@ ors were accused because of highly poor cases of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ porter to write about previous inci@@ dents in this restaurant , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man came to a military attack .
only a few months before , the readers could have seen the Kolum@@ ba of Val@@ dez as the most informed source about the kidn@@ apping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sooner we had already known what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El FLACO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of his slim body stat@@ stat@@ ur . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
the office of Val@@ dez has been dedicated to the storage space for signs and sti@@ ckers that prot@@ ested against the murder of journalists because the employees have become something they had never expected : activists in the name of the press .
Miri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez sn@@ ap a few signs and went to a demonstration in the next morning to a demonstration for another journalist to the office of the prosec@@ utor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared after three days , after Val@@ dez was killed , in the western state of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA testing that it is of his .
&quot; &quot; &quot; throughout the country , journalists have become more powerful by written in organised &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on walking trails and buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on that day the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and attempts to collect international support for the judiciary in the case of Val@@ dez .
on a meeting with the Gover@@ nor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez accused Ram@@ i@@ rez the authorities , journalists have sp@@ ook@@ y and bring them down because they have said the truth .
she has then asked that she is divided by the government again because it is concerned that their anger has violated their objectivity .
Val@@ dez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime , in the involved government officials and a uniform society . &quot;
in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ journalism , &quot; he wrote that re@@ por@@ ters are not only killed by drug gangs but also on command of politicians and security forces , organised with organised crime under a ceiling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ulo 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ulo 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been assigned more than half of the attacks to journalists of the police and officials last year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico you give , because they want you dis@@ proportionate the mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously the Mor@@ a have a deter@@ rent effect .
nobody for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger in Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
your body was found along with a note that was alle@@ ge@@ dly signed by Z@@ etas @-@ Kart@@ ell , &quot; here I am due to my reports . &quot;
a Computer@@ ta@@ stat@@ ur and ear@@ phones in addition to their separate head .
some Fili@@ als have chosen to conclude , like the newspaper El Nor@@ te at the northern Border State of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of the correspon@@ dents Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue to do as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo , after the assass@@ ination of her director in 2004 .
in 2010 the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ arez openly addressed the drug cart@@ els with a guideline on the front page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled from their native states or even from the country .
it is a painful choice .
it is hard to find work in exile and they still watch the streets and look for dangers .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as it seems to be mur@@ dered to the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was assass@@ inated with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the flight from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who stay rec@@ essed and continuing the work , it is a daily dance with risky decisions .
I@@ barra , who once wanted to be poet there is that the drug outlets made him scar@@ ed .
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and that is why I became re@@ porter , &quot; he said .
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last edition was already finished , the editors of Rio@@ do@@ ce began on the side@@ walk in front of the office and tran@@ ken beer , than once all of their phones began .
a series of sho@@ ot@@ ings with band@@ reefs and security forces near the seaside Maz@@ at@@ lan had 19 confirmed ti@@ ote .
the war escal@@ ated further , as promised by a series of Kart@@ ell messages in the region .
from the st@@ ony edge , they have published the news on the website of Rio@@ do@@ ce on mobile phone .
the title page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens he@@ ul@@ ins close to - another sliding in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the police officers , the guards held to see if they were in readiness .
if they were afraid of all , they did not show it .
under the enormous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle @-@ finger was visible for quite sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Rio@@ do@@ ce followed its mark .
&quot; how can you just think of close , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; when on the same day , at which Javier was mur@@ dered , the inter@@ c@@ n asked me to send it to the street reporting . &quot;
dinosau@@ rs used cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age to devi@@ ate his enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue if a terri@@ fying .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now researchers have found that the first findings of the unbelievable Nas@@ horn of a Canadian mountain job were so well preserved that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the dinosau@@ rs &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was so well received that they could even find that his fun@@ eral skin was from red@@ dish brown - and they said they would have had something of a &quot; un@@ quiet past . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the magazine &quot; Current Biology &quot; presented him as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; persu@@ aded dinosau@@ rs , who ever found was , and one of the best dinosau@@ rs in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fossil is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier , who lived in the middle of the time period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
its incredibly well @-@ rare state has researchers , which it is considered &quot; really remarkable . &quot;
according to reports in National Geo@@ graphic the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant @-@ e@@ aters is the best preserved Fossi@@ l of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k when he was in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alberta , Canada , G@@ b .
he met something , what was missing from the surrounding rocks on the board , and decided to see more exact .
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal T@@ yr@@ rell Museum of Pale@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years in passing the wild beast within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) to un@@ cover heavy cru@@ mbs .
after all this hard work , the finished product is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you are just blin@@ king with your eyes , you could almost believe it has slept , &quot; said the main author , Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist in the Royal T@@ yr@@ rell Museum , where the creature is to be seen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is in the science of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosau@@ rs , the Mon@@ a Lisa is the dinosau@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
researchers have found that this plant @-@ e@@ aters , although he is covered with a armor and a changing tank , probably from meat @-@ eating dinosau@@ rs was threatened .
the strongly ar@@ mor@@ ed dinosau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age to hide from car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es , and used a shi@@ el@@ ding technology that is known as counterparts that is also used by many modern animals .
this could have allowed to blend better in its surroundings and so@@ ak up his enemies , say experts , which indicates that it was threatened by larger dinosau@@ rs .
the 110 million years old creature from the family of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs took place in May for the first time and is now at the Royal T@@ yr@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild beast and called it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli to the Muse@@ um@@ ste@@ techni@@ cian Mark Mitch@@ ell , one of a team who spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours with it carefully .
the amazing preservation of the specimen made it possible to document Dr. Mitch@@ ell and an international team of scientists , the pattern and the form of shed and arm@@ our over his body .
they discovered the conv@@ ul@@ ing , a common defence method in animal @-@ rich , meaning that the tip of the creature was dar@@ ker than its under@@ side .
although the conv@@ ul@@ ing is custom@@ ary , the results are surprising because the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta is by far the animals living in today .
it indicates that the dinosau@@ rs was hun@@ ted from enough pressure by flesh , dinosau@@ r dinosau@@ r that evolution is wearing the confrontation as a means of survival fav@@ ours .
but most contemporary animals that use the ter@@ at@@ oning - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or G@@ ür@@ n@@ oses - are much smaller and vulnerable to prey , what sign@@ aled that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs was exposed to a real battle for survival .
&quot; strong pre@@ tier behavior on a massive , strongly p@@ umped dinosau@@ r show how dangerous the dinosau@@ rs pre@@ dat@@ ors have to have been , &quot; said Brown .
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosau@@ r is brown .
scientists continue to investigate the animal to hints about his life , including its preserved intest@@ ine to find out what it has eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the dinosau@@ rs , when he died , went into a river and went out into the sea , where he sank on the back to the bottom .
at that time Alberta was as warm as South flu@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably widespread much further than they are today .
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable because it is fully covered with preser@@ v@@ ative skin , but also preserved in three dimensions and retains the original form of the animal , &quot; said Brown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that the animal is almost exactly the same today as in the early K@@ rei@@ row . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you do not need to use much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you are just a little with the eyes sc@@ iel@@ s , you could almost believe that it is on sleep . &quot;
the chal@@ k time was a time when huge Ther@@ opo@@ lies , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous dinosau@@ r , who stood on the ground on two legs .
although the king of them , the ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus rex , lived million years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed dinosau@@ rs was hun@@ ted from some of his fur@@ ious ancestors .
this includes the Acro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 feet ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters .
the scientists , their latest findings in the journal Current Biology will seem , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta was buried after the death in the sea and in mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k when he was in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alberta , Canada , G@@ b .
according to the museum it is the occupied ar@@ mor@@ ed dinosau@@ rs of the world , including skin and arm@@ aments , and is complete from the mu@@ zzle up to the hip .
the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and have weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it enth@@ uses two 20 @-@ inch @-@ long tips that ra@@ ged from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant @-@ e@@ aters was curved through the Western Canada , until a floo@@ ded river floo@@ ded into the open sea .
but the under@@ pin of the dinosau@@ rs keep his armor in exquisite detail .
the du@@ ly rem@@ n@@ ants of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains still hol@@ low panels along the dinosau@@ rs
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko has written for National Geo@@ graphic , such a level of preservation is as rare as a prize in Lot@@ to .
the more I see it , the more confusing it becomes .
pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of the skin still cover the hol@@ low panels that carry the sk@@ ull of the beast .
its right belly is on his side , his five fingers are split up .
I can count the scales on his sole . &quot;
in the storm : Mass@@ enk@@ ar@@ age on A@@ 8 : many wounded
fierce accident on Thursday night on the A@@ 8 : just below 30 cars are involved in a massage aram@@ bol@@ age .
there are numerous g@@ ages , length of kilometres - and G@@ aff@@ er .
on the highway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) , on the late Thursday afternoon , about 20 people have been violated .
after the first statements of the police were at 17.00 hours between the connectors Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district Ai@@ ch@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm of almost 30 cars , including probably also trucks .
about the exact number of the last days no data is at first .
it act at light to moderate injuries , said a pol@@ ic@@ is@@ pre@@ cher .
a big b@@ ump@@ ot of lif@@ ebo@@ at vehicles was at the accident .
the A@@ 8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich .
in the direction of Munich it formed a few kilometres long back@@ yard .
like an A@@ Z re@@ porter , it came also on the opposite way to massive disabilities - by numerous gen@@ ers .
the fire@@ bri@@ g@@ ade noti@@ fies the marks of the craft that now have to be reck@@ oned with sensitive pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 Then the second accident occurred on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
it has come to a collision between an auto@@ cl@@ ot@@ ran@@ ter and a passenger car .
a Res@@ cue @-@ Hel@@ icop@@ ter was on the way to the accident .
Deutsche Bahn : Group test@@ et &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everybody has experienced it : nothing is sitting on the train and sleeps .
or one is deep@@ ened in his work and has just an in@@ geni@@ ous thought .
and then : pu@@ ff@@ f .
comes the Schaff@@ ner and w@@ akes out a be@@ acon or p@@ ours the boat in the middle of the workflow .
ticket control .
but times of inter@@ rup@@ tions are soon over .
the German Rail@@ ways are currently able to control the loose @-@ card control .
one simply confirms that mobile phone that you have taken place and de@@ valued to the ticket .
currently , a test operation is running on two routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes the offer , we expand it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is then expected to be available on many other remote transportation lines in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; said a railway speaker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls the train the ticket de@@ valu@@ ation without any Schaff@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to use that , however , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to book an online ticket - what already most passengers do .
it also has to be purchased via the app of rail , the DB navig@@ ator , which is the most convenient way of ticket bookings .
and finally , you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works so : one climb@@ s up in the train , calls his ticket to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the test customer then a button to the electronic de@@ valu@@ ation appears .
the train guides got on their mobile devices a message that Dra@@ g@@ ast X has been on the train and the booked seat Y Y has taken .
comes the train manager at the ticket control at square Y , he knows that there is a passenger sitting there with already un@@ tested online ticket .
you can continue to sleep , continue to keep silent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn is to use passengers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; who relax@@ es without ticket supervision by our train staff want to travel , check in the DB navig@@ ator simply yourself .
this allows the passengers to shape their travel time in the train of personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , marketing executive board of DB tel@@ esc@@ ope .
&quot; &quot; &quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to address the individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who often drives train , knows that next to delays and pas@@ si@@ sts are part of the chassis controls to the greatest anno@@ y@@ ments .
because often , one does not have any documents in any case , but one of the participants do not need all the documents concerning the de@@ valu@@ ation of online tickets .
either the credit card or the recruitment card or otherwise a document you have to indicate .
the consequence are endless discussions between the train and chassis , which leads to poor mood in the part or large space and delays in the control of your own tickets and takes the creator at the end the time to take care of other concerns .
you can use only a small number of test clients to use the new service .
and that also applies to the connections of ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further draw numbers on the same route are not yet un@@ locked .
how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 , Brittany Fer@@ rell was sha@@ ken up to its core .
just one day after having arrived in New York City , sitting in St. Louis born on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment that they rented and scroll by Facebook on their phone .
you stum@@ bled across a post from someone from the high school .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year child and it is still on the road , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused , because nobody else had posted the information on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly saved on its tim@@ eline .
the R@@ apper from the area of St. Louis was doing the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , killed , live to twe@@ ets .
he made a picture of Brow@@ ns alive body that was spread on the road and stay there four hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought Fer@@ rell . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she put her cell phone to return later in the evening to T@@ we@@ ets on people on the Can@@ field Drive .
there were photos of the police band and people , the fl@@ ash@@ y , and by a man who claimed to be the father &apos;s father , who carried a sign with the trans@@ cription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ ons police have just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she watched a live feed at which a polic@@ eman stood before a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bell@@ ishing dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , escaped another police and cried : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reminded of their statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder that we have acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to us and which we can call . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at this moment I felt sho@@ ok .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
you booked a return flight and went home next day .
after landing at 23 p.m. , she took her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two would drive to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning .
what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the cinem@@ as from 11 .
it is a history of survival and protest , of love and loss , the strength and resistance , which consists of the point of view of man who live in the community and filled the streets to request answers .
as Fer@@ rell with her daughter , who took a flower pity and a matching crown to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , spoke the two a conversation that they had countless times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black condition . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember , as I have taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reminded them of what they said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police have killed a 18 year old boy and that was not right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I could not take them , &quot; said Fer@@ rell later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is happening today is a highlight of what happened in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they have to know and see it and be raised in it .
it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organisation , but also know the different layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to free ourselves to free ourselves .
even though I have the luck to give her an experience in which they personally experience no e@@ kl@@ at@@ ant racism , it is not different from the next black women &apos;s child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have the feeling , I would prove her a bad service to keep them away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first stop when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which became a camp@@ ground when the activists had waited on the possible non @-@ accus@@ ation of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there Fer@@ rell and her daughter joined together with a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared pockets before and hal@@ ted them pass on demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new type of activ@@ ism began to accept for Fer@@ rell &apos;s shape .
&quot; my activ@@ ism has changed after 9 August , &quot; she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ souri Saint Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on eating justice and health inequalities in black communities .
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it is all come . &quot;
weeks later , Fer@@ rell met in an evening demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ director of the film .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said , she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted only to document , &quot; what happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a question came Fer@@ rell in the sense : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to document or tries to find a story that you can use ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often from wh@@ ites - in a community that benef@@ ited from their pain and its resistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently explained in an interview : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that people who were born in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , who have not raised their votes and we wanted to do it differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis as well , an artist from the area that is known for its activ@@ ism around too .
his engagement led Fer@@ rell closer to the project , along with six other natives followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ns Er@@ go@@ ose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us . we talk &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Davis said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the main thing for me how these people will be represented , because I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to focus on Ferr@@ ells experience - to show that it is in the movement &quot; not about a Messiah leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the most obvious participant in the film .
consequently , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets show documents from &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Ferr@@ ells Life , as she loves and mar@@ ries her wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when they saw the finished product for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that this work and the human@@ ization of black people must give a certain vulner@@ ability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Ferr@@ ells History repeated the role of black gay women in the broader Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three founders of the movement , which after the kill@@ ings of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 have shaped the film &quot; Black@@ li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have supported the movement altogether , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women must carry the main load of everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an voted , to notice that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement really kept from black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Fer@@ rell was chosen as the heart of the film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she was the person who stir@@ red this energy , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no coincidence , although it was at the front line because with a life on these crosses as a black , gay woman is so much at stake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can feel their energy by the screen . &quot;
in the meantime the communication eras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have recently disappeared , but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rell is at the currency for 2 ½ years due to the block@@ ade of a highway at a demonstration .
it describes the soci@@ opoli@@ tical atmosphere of the area they call their home : &quot; a mess . &quot;
nevertheless they cl@@ oned to a voc@@ als and she feels committed to that memory , since then she went into F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the street three years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we need to love each other and support .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; Dream &quot; to &quot; size &quot; : TV @-@ reader discuss about bit @-@ gallery
the bit gallery moves the people , although they are not yet built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre at the south of the pedestrian zone moved since the first presentation 2009 the population in supporters and opponents .
cold lets the issue hardly be one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also on our Facebook @-@ page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pop@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is discussed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the one to the bit @-@ gallery say : &quot; this would be a dream &quot; ( An@@ ja Becker ) or &quot; This would be genuine class &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; does not need a man &quot; ( Sig@@ gi bun@@ cle ) or quite simply : &quot; size w@@ ahn ! &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) .
while the advocates build that a gallery attracts more customers to the city , of which also the rest of business profit , fear the opponents , that then the pedestrian prec@@ inct .
added : the gallery is planned exactly on the property , based on the farm market hall , where the 13 director will market their products .
with the start of construction work , it will be concluded .
the gallery @-@ makers want to integrate a market hall in the new building - and in the Bed@@ a square with possibility to sitting outside .
Simone Rooms : &quot; we have been buying almost weekly in the farm hall for many years .
mostly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the rural women are always happy to be very happy .
also the but@@ cher we have discovered for us too .
we would wish that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also this .
especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Ger@@ d D@@ ensing : &quot; whether direct marketing in a market hall in the gallery , arrives at the height of the rental .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but this might not be very low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva Kili@@ c : &quot; why shopping spar@@ es in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I find that superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there are already enough in our city .
one can see how many shop@@ pers can be empty here - some for months and years .
but since there is not even a proper weekly market there , it is all the more important that at least the market hall will remain .
for after all , the goods offered there is fresh , is mostly offered directly from the producer and is purely inexpensive .
as you can see , shop@@ pers will be reserved in a shopping center just from larger companies , because the dor@@ ms are often not portable for a retailer .
too bad , special transactions there are almost no more and that which is still left will then also disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping mall with a market hall is not fit for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
especially : where is the farmers market hall during the construction period ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit @-@ gallery really comes from .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or create the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bit @-@ gallery already previously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exp@@ el all business from Bit@@ burg ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; this will simply not work .
and a Shopping Center , which stands blank also needs no one .
in my opinion , it would have been better to promote a real farmers market instead of this gallery .
but for a peasant market hall , I give it thanks to the v@@ ahn@@ ig many - as I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in Bit@@ burg no place anymore .
when the farmers market hall is made , a piece of culture will disappear . &quot;
a suitable simil@@ arity : artist manages portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
in the middle of the room of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which hang out almost im@@ percep@@ tible to the cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen tu@@ bers and hair styles , which were sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the out@@ ings out of the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former secret service an@@ alysts spent a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after they publicly made as ge@@ heim collap@@ sed diplomatic reports on the Wi@@ ki@@ Le@@ aks site .
the new exhibition , which was opened on 2 August , is called A Be@@ coming resem@@ b@@ bon ( A suitable simil@@ arity ) .
it is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline united its expertise in technology , computer sciences and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ ine and pioneering dis@@ mis@@ ed , whose condem@@ nation was transformed by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has created by the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA , which could look out of Mann@@ ing and look out of the 30 portraits , a sharp if something intellectual comment could not only be interpreted as the form@@ ability of DNA data - the many ways that can be interpreted as well as the in@@ dur@@ ative det@@ er@@ min@@ ism of these interpre@@ tations - but also to identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but already spoke openly for her pu@@ ber@@ ty over the identification as a woman , was sentenced in 2013 due to 20 accus@@ ations , including six violations of the Spi@@ on@@ age@@ Act , Computer was and theft .
through the prison her image was suppres@@ sed , so much that it was only a single photo - a gran@@ ular , black @-@ white be@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing is visi@@ bly sit on a driver &apos;s seat and carries a plat@@ inum permit - with which it was associated .
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came straight from the great success of their 2012 @-@ project &apos; stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
in it , the artist portraits of stran@@ gers from for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts like cigarette stub@@ ble and chew@@ ing g@@ um that extracts the DNA out of the waste to make a picture of how these people could look like .
this was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from an newspaper magazine .
&quot; they led an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing , while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press show of the new exhibition .
and she could not visit this time and she could not be photographed , so they took contact with Chelsea , and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and their imprison@@ ed M@@ use were un@@ equal to un@@ equal spectac@@ les , which inter@@ changeable several letters over the course of two years .
they even created one of Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o Illu@@ sion@@ ed Com@@ ic &quot; Supp@@ res@@ sed Images , &quot; which would a future fores@@ ee in which the President Ch@@ ert@@ as would be ruling and they were able to see the exhibition personally .
that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published , cre@@ ings release after seven brutal years would demand in a military l@@ ame in K@@ ans@@ as , was a welcome type of happy meeting .
there is also something deep and Star@@ kes since Donald Tru@@ mp will lead a war against inform@@ ers from the governance and against trans@@ gender @-@ troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to fix the rigid mo@@ tions which he should actually fix .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , after the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; things happen from a certain reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in one on the wall of the gallery called the artistic statement called Mann@@ ing with her over@@ great signature underneath ( the &quot; i &quot; in their sur@@ name is provided with a heart ) an end of the &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , whose basis of gender , race , sexuality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall is her mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a exchange of Cs and GS , and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show by the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or Nu@@ sti@@ o@@ ti@@ des after the highly developed scientific enc@@ y@@ clo@@ pedia of the artist ) how amazing , at least in biological regard , we all are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what people will hopefully bring , is that our gen@@ ome is not about who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , too . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories so they are 30 of these stories . &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition which is kept in a separate room is a page from the above com@@ ic Nov@@ elle .
it shows Mann@@ ing , as it appears with a free pre@@ cht@@ el@@ ef@@ on in the hand of the discipl@@ in@@ arctic of the United States like King @-@ Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they face your speech , then they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; so never stop the mouth . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said the artist , who greet them from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still come ge@@ ese when I speak about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was predicted in the Com@@ ic@@ book - but if they should do it , then it will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic sim@@ ulators that collap@@ sed like hor@@ semen of prot@@ esters .
this was also pur@@ pos@@ e@@ ful as everything was written in the exhibition until the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , cre@@ ings St@@ atur ) , with which its genetic H@@ ap@@ log@@ gers were written with pencil .
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted to feel like a crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it feels like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement , which were also hidden behind their liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of the University of North@@ western and a leading university of Oxford because of kill@@ ings
a great human hunt is underway for a professor at North@@ western University and a staff at Oxford University who were looking for as susp@@ ects after a man had been killed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries .
on Monday were issued for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ t because of her alleged participation in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as the acts of the court of Cook County .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , after several stit@@ ches died .
one of the police authority of Chicago published non @-@ community warning @-@ system states that the Lei@@ che was discovered on 27 July .
officials received a call , came to the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries at his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared on the place of action for dead , and det@@ ective examine the stit@@ ch as murder , while the police actively seeks after the two susp@@ ects , said officials .
La@@ a has been an extraordinary Professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at North@@ western University .
Alan K. Cub@@ ans , Vice President for University Relations , said in an e @-@ mail explanation that La@@ ws shall now be released abroad and excluded from entering the campus of North@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal matter which will be investigated by the competent authorities , and the North@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; said Cub@@ ans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University .
a spokes@@ man of the university and the Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail explanation , that &quot; we are in contact with the police in Britain and are ready to help U.S. investig@@ ators in every conceivable manner . &quot;
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens colleagues were sho@@ cked and want it to be .
Chief Communications Officer of the police authority of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he urge the susp@@ ect to face the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police has a idea of their residence , and our efforts to locate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said , the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand @-@ Plaza @-@ Building , who had just received a mysterious tip that had happened in apartment 10@@ 08 .
the police described the scene as a very cru@@ el .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July .
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ ws and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management team of Grand Plaza released a statement to the residents : &quot; the police currently works on the tim@@ eline and the background of the offering , and explores a variety of moti@@ fs , including a possible home incident . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will conclude the W@@ ada &apos;s roadmap in the near future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Russian vice @-@ ep@@ re@@ mi@@ er Mut@@ ko
the Russian Viz@@ ep@@ re@@ mi@@ er Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said it will not last long until the remaining criteria of the world anti @-@ doping agency ( W@@ ada ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti @-@ Doping Agency ( R@@ USA@@ DA ) .
&quot; at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap R@@ USA@@ DA has the right to plan and test and test cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ doping ) .
the W@@ ada @-@ roadmap has been updated in this respect , &quot; stated mut@@ ko on Thursday .
the PM commented on the second part of the roadmap of W@@ ada to comply with the Code , which describes the criteria for re @-@ determination of R@@ USA@@ DA and recently published on the website of the organization .
according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could give rise to Russia for Russia .
&quot; everything was announced , everything will be implemented .
and the results will be submitted to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and W@@ ada in the near future , &quot; he added .
one of the criteria listed in the list is determined that the Russian anti @-@ doping authorities have to publicly accept the reported findings of the endor@@ sed by the Canadian attorney Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren to public state @-@ based D@@ op@@ ings in Russian sport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in relation to the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation as our anti @-@ doping system has plug@@ ged an error . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no government programs , and we will not admit that which does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mut@@ iny words coinci@@ ded with those of Vit@@ aly S@@ mir@@ nov , the leader of the independent Russian Anti @-@ Doping Commission .
in conversation with Russian Sales Office R@@ Sport at the beginning of the day S@@ mir@@ nov gave problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ doping organisations , but then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
nobody has to accept this report un@@ condi@@ tionally , &quot; added S@@ mir@@ nov .
R@@ USA@@ DA was excluded in November 2015 in the wake of the doping sc@@ and@@ als from the W@@ ada of the implementation of D@@ op@@ ing@@ controls in Russia .
however , it has been allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ Doping ( U@@ K@@ AD ) .
after a visit to the captain of the organization in Moscow in July , W@@ ada @-@ Director Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli , that R@@ USA@@ DA is moving &quot; in the right direction , &quot; to be used again .

&quot; they now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for your business , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools used by companies to measure employees engagement .
salvation said that they have a better insight into what your employees think and feel with G@@ lin@@ t in the three years .
in addition to the Sn@@ ap surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat @-@ card of the company , which shows in a look at which units have most complaints and which leaders have low charge results - so that you can indul@@ ge why .
companies come to see that at the forefront of workplace culture must remain so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber which has been implic@@ ated in Sk@@ and@@ ale since a former employee has published a blog post , which describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ings , in which those who have spoken , pun@@ ished .
for start @-@ ups like G@@ lin@@ t , this desire is an overview of lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity .
the Global Governance , regulation and Compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion value according to the financial and technical Website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps prevent bad behavior and recognize , saw a rising interest and activity beginning of this year in the midst of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ all in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
Conver@@ cent has almost 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
u@@ ber has recently signed up as a client .
as G@@ lin@@ t , Conver@@ tible company leaves tailor @-@ made &quot; pul@@ mon@@ ary , &quot; confidential responses in real time and watch the warmth @-@ cards of your problem areas .
it also provides an anonymous SMS hotline with the employee who can make bad behavior .
and if the main business leader is included , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court of public opinion has recorded the regul@@ ators , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , founder and CEO of Conver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a company is found that its employees treated poorly or beha@@ ves un@@ ethical , it can experience precious consequences by consumers @-@ boy@@ cott , workers @-@ fluctu@@ ation and c@@ ages , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations , Conver@@ cent has been used for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have an easy way to achieve its corporate headquarters .
sooner if a employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to submit a phone number or e @-@ mail for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously .
it was often a intim@@ id@@ ation and uncomfortable experience , James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Coun@@ sel who said , there was no good chance to follow the complaints from employees .
well , since the company employs a Conver@@ cent , can problems that have been hidden in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unconscious practic@@ ality - faster identified and addressed .
&quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 degree view in the experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano that leads the risk management Group from Ruby Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders in employment law &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
company began to appoint ethics , values and employees engagement in 2002 after the accounting company Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ ses due to ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
but it lasted until the &quot; Social Media came to their right , &quot; that companies recognised that you could not prevent their dirty laundry online .
&quot; prior to using technology for the monitoring of ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both G@@ lin@@ t as well as Conver@@ tible offer your software as a service and strain the company with recur@@ ring fees for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance that will find the consent of Venture Capital investors , which both have supported start @-@ ups .
Conver@@ cent received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as S@@ apphire vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , which was raised the entire capital to $ 47 million .
gl@@ it@@ ans secured $ 10 million in November by Bes@@ se@@ mer Venture partner and brought up his entire finance to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising , given the connected nature of companies , culture and Venture Capital .
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more than ever before .
in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley are high sal@@ aries and interesting projects only inserts .
staff want to have the feeling that you are accepted and valued and that you will give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; when people are glad to be in a company that is worth their voices , and that the work you are doing is worthwhile to make this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience on Linked@@ In that both Conver@@ tible and G@@ lin@@ t .
investors reach Ren@@ di@@ ets when their portfolio companies are well running . companies run well if employees are engaged and engaged in it .
if the analytics tools of third parties promise , commitment and commitment to employees , it is no wonder that you will find assistance .
the data on employee involvement according to the experts of work culture is important .
but the data are useless if the administrator of a company does not take action .
in fact , if a company asks staff for your feedback , it can have an expectation that change on the way .
and if the change does not come quickly enough , or not at all , this can breed dis@@ appointments and employees .
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you need to be ready to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies who have left themselves too much on collecting data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you do not follow the staff to ask , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you take care of it ?
and who do not worry about why should I ? &quot;
Ma@@ dison Reed who runs for monthly surveys now , was able to initiate measures on the same day when a problem is reported about G@@ lin@@ t , says Er@@ ret@@ t .
and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees it was through the speed of decision @-@ making and the quality of communication , capable of organising several teams within the company and add a communication training to tackle the problems .
in Ruby Tuesday , the company always receives new insights on the employees , and it hopes that in a long run , this leads to a better li@@ aison of workers in a sector that is known for high revenues .
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose men , &quot; said Vit@@ rano .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you lose man , you also lose customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if you lose customers , you will lose companies .
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the brood
it is available at 23 o &apos;clock , when a lot of U@@ CL@@ A Foot@@ ball@@ ers enter@@ tained on one side of the new exercise fields of the team on the campus .
some have moved their Tri@@ oto@@ x@@ parts and show the back full of swe@@ at from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team these in@@ active minutes make a lunch break .
players who are j@@ umped into the summer courses , will return after the three @-@ hour practice to their final audi@@ ts before they return the next morning at 6 : 30 am to the water@@ man Football Center .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is for the guys the next three days a real tre@@ ad mill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before the Monday to Tuesday was created . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to ease the load of players , and she has actually extended their days - at least until the finish on Friday .
therefore , the first three trainings of the U@@ CL@@ A at 19 : 15 am starting to meet the already packed schedules of the players .
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the brood is moved almost one week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six game times in West@@ wood practical exercises .
they are supposed to keep in the course of August 18 exercises . 20 before the beginning of the formal game preparation for their pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he support the rules of the N@@ CA@@ A support , even if they add the multiple @-@ employed routes of the player to another point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put these enormous burden three or four days on them , and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they simply have de@@ pressed , they plac@@ ken further , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think once we come up to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . &quot;
the U@@ CL@@ A will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished , resulting in the light of its fields from an adjacent parking place and the adjoining Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the up@@ scale class that has already been a protective network behind a door@@ pole , no easy task will be .
brood players should occupy the hotel from this weekend but Mor@@ a adm@@ its that there might be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; we will put our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far @-@ fet@@ ched thinking that people rent a room there and then set out there to record an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the Vide@@ ob@@ and of a exercise , it is a fairly good deal .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces at parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
I am not so much worried about this .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensify facts review in the fight against counterf@@ eit news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with fal@@ tering feed@@ backs from third parties and show their results below the original contribution , then show the world &apos;s largest online social @-@ social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News .
the company said in an opinion on his website , that it will begin with the use of updated training methods to recognize possible counterf@@ eit messages and to send them to fact audi@@ ted that may display results of the billing review from the original article .
Facebook was critici@@ zed as one of the main distributor points for so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News , many of which believe they have also influenced the US presidential elections 2016 .
the problem is also become a major political issue in Europe , whereby the French voters were floo@@ ded in advance of the presidential elections in May with false stories , and Germany will support a plan to be pun@@ ished after social media networks , as before the elections in September .
on Thursday Facebook in a separate statement on German , that in the US , France , the Netherlands and Germany will have launched a test of the new facts review .
&quot; in addition to the realization , what stories of fact are requested by third parties , people want more context to make sound decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara S@@ u , product man@@ ag@@ ger for Facebook @-@ News in a blog .
she added that Facebook continues to be &quot; test &quot; in connection with the article &quot; in connection &quot; and to other changes in his news feed to reduce false messages .
creating a Com@@ ic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his younger past the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a sip for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in 1970 @-@ er and 1980 @-@ years .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history of its comfortable seat at the Be@@ w@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and is now inspiration for a graphical novel by Jamie Rhodes , a m@@ op@@ ha@@ ired Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I find it so nice to look at the manuscript of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says he we@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; sel@@ ects the time from the Middle Ages to the Age of Edward and documents the families that were illustrated in Scot@@ ney - Isaac Fu@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Is@@ abel Green@@ berg .
it is not the first book by Rhodes , which is based on an archive : he wrote 2014 &apos;@@ Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpected emotional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have only re@@ acted to the thumb@@ nail on the side of a letter , which was written by a double @-@ person in the 1700 @-@ years , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is his perman@@ ence !
and letters always smells by smoke ; for that time there was a fire because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect , as if he himself would be .
Oh , I love Archive ! &quot;
for someone who be@@ aten up with old papers , he is supported by National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have been a little exagger@@ ated &quot; ) it seems all too beautiful to be true .
Rhodes spent his days to explore the vi@@ kt@@ ori@@ anic &quot; new &quot; castle to study the archives and study the many treasures and curiosity of the castle , such as the mon@@ opoli@@ tical hym@@ ns on the walls and the bottles that have spent centuries in the dit@@ ch .
he emig@@ rated through the terrain and ruins of the old castle , and spoke with Land@@ s@@ ors , gar@@ den@@ ers , and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
then , at night he drank &quot; whis@@ key and began to write . &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust received the full access in 2006 when the last resort , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey died .
as Rhodes , a decade later hit , the employees began to take care of the archive which he said as &quot; hundreds of years , where ari@@ sto@@ cr@@ ats said &quot; Oh , wir@@ t it on the attic .
Ta@@ vern , letters from the time of English emp@@ ires , maps that what poss@@ essed : &quot; you could mean that land conflict would be boring , &quot; says Rhodes , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to have fought two families .
guys , let everything go its way ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse on bre@@ wing base in the English story , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which leaves a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of a mo@@ il that appeared in 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book with the title &apos; Kni@@ gh@@ tly family of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , says Rhodes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the peasant uprising began in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
maybe the two are connected ? &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the history of the Jesu@@ it , who hid the history of Dar@@ rell seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , in which the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rell is presented from the 18th century , who filled his own fun@@ eral ( a discovery that was made only years later than his sar@@ g was excav@@ ated ) .
the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rhodes &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gentlemen sle@@ ep@@ y to be more and again and spending money for things they could not afford .
other generations of Dar@@ rell @-@ men extingu@@ ished their debt crises - I imagine them as a he@@ ap of well @-@ looking boys , with a talent to advertise . &quot;
after the end of his use in the castle , Rhodes is in search of other unique scre@@ am experiences
he has brought a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a Com@@ ic novel on El@@ äm@@ än@@ mä@@ ki , the terrain of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been res@@ umed by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; says he .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to be done again with the dam@@ n life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle rolls in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the sle@@ eves of the 3@@ 01 year old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Honnef started on Friday their campaign to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) .
until Thursday , Mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team want to keep the logo and slogan to Nelson Art@@ z .
at the end of August it should be a highlight of the campaign to give a festival on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; too beautiful for us .
or ? , ask the creators of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer chapel .
&quot; we think that ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; write them on their yesterday released web page .
&quot; but we use this measure to gain your attention .
and to make it clear that some is better than it seems .
basically , we are the firm conviction that we as Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer citizens know about the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city very well . &quot;
in the action it &apos;s going to be more than &quot; a logo and a slogan , it is said to continue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true to form@@ ulate a single promise that gives the city an unmistak@@ able feature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally , they stand in the competition with other municipalities .
a mid @-@ digit amount is the town of Bad Honnef its new umbrella brand and the campaign cost .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
every year in early August advis@@ es in Ankara of the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) about pen@@ sion@@ ers and transport in the officer .
so this week .
at first sight a normal operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but nothing is routine among the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup d &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the session did not take place in the building of the General Staff , as formerly , but at the office seat of the prime minister .
at the proceedings , under the presidency of the Government , the five Vice @-@ Chancellor , as well as the Minister of Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs took part .
thus , the civilians in the Y@@ as were in the over@@ number .
the government moves into the army in the military .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General@@ ate Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the com@@ mander of the army , the air forces and the Navy were set . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the v@@ eit@@ ed Cou@@ p , President Erdo@@ gan has frozen 169 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of the connected connections to the movement of the exile Pre@@ dig@@ ger Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , the Erdo@@ gan as a dragon moving of the coup .
against 4@@ 86 people who have been directly involved in the coup trial , will be negotiated in Ankara since this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had called the overthrow of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; God &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as he gives him the opportunity to puri@@ fy the Ar@@ med Forces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really grip the army under control ?
in late February the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article with the heading &quot; Un@@ hairy in the military @-@ headquarters . &quot;
in the General Staff there are concerns over an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which manifested itself among others in the abolition of the head@@ ho@@ ist ban on soldiers , wrote the paper .
the Greater Region of the Army and the security forces at any rate goes on .
in the middle of July Erdo@@ gan by decre@@ e became more 73@@ 95 state serving , including 2@@ 303 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed like Erdo@@ gan the military was en@@ umer@@ ated .
the gener@@ als earlier than the actual masters of the country .
three times put@@ ted them on appeal to their role as gu@@ ardian of the world state order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan returns the power of the military step by step , not least by calling on the reforms of the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
former officials say Erdo@@ gan driving is targeted by the Islam@@ ization of the Ar@@ med Forces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a name is not called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; who sought after the coup attempt from fear of persecution abroad asylum , the Turkish army will be &quot; full of extremi@@ sts and sal@@ af@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
meets this , such a development could not be cold .
anyway , in the alliance after the cleansing of the Turkish army , there are doubts about the operational readiness of the Turkish army .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the leadership structures and operational capabilities be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weak@@ ened &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; say Nato @-@ diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of Green Card , said President Donald Tru@@ mp , cited by the media .
he sees the legal immig@@ rant on 50,000 per year to lower stri@@ c@@ ter rules for obtaining vis@@ as for a temporary work permit and limitations for families @-@ oriented visa .
the new rules are proposed by the Republi@@ can and supported by the President .
the bill should be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers , and will do this by the US to change the way the citizens from other countries Green Cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent the chains of chains and replace the current system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this new candidate procedure will come to the candidates who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that our economy will benefit from &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Tru@@ mp , cited by American media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ministry wants to rolling track for racing shuttle
over the past few months over the future of the race boats have been disp@@ uted - now it is supposed to go fast .
even before the end of the year , at the mar@@ o@@ des track , on which the tourist railway runs , will be built .
in order to secure the future of the racing sh@@ utt@@ les in the long term , according to the data of the Traffic Ministry , is scheduled to start the circuit in this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to further order and rolling stock Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ ingen , the country is familiar with this important connection , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated traffic state Secretary Klaus Sü@@ hl on Friday in Erfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost of the maintenance of the route was reduced to approximately 2.5 million euros .
of this amount the land over@@ take 75 percent .
the agreement on which the shuttle is to be ordered also in the future of the country , will be finally matched , explained Sü@@ ver .
the ministry and the southwest as the operator had already agreed upon the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are the roadmap , the used vehicles and quality standards , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sü@@ ver . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
this means that the racing car @-@ shuttle service can be ordered in December 2017 .
the race track shuttle is a particularly popular railway connection between the train stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
in recent months the course of a pilot company had been tested whether the route is used by sufficient many people to order them in the future .
the track is also in parts strong .
the rise of sex robots is real , and we should worry about ourselves
just as you thought it can not be crazy , a new report comes about technological developments in the field of sex robots .
yes , actually .
sex robots are currently a big thing .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for responsible Robotics ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , em@@ eri@@ ous professor for robo@@ tics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield und Mit@@ founder of FR@@ R , we must begin to take its rise seriously .
customers can choose the eye colour of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of fing@@ ern@@ ails .
&quot; people make themselves fun , but the companies deliver any quantity of it , and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; said Mr. Shar@@ ed on the release of his new report .
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ bs have evolved from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a si@@ licon that feels warm and with deliberately human reactions , which are achieved by artificial intelligence .
the user can also adjust its robots according to his beliefs &quot; and select everything from the eye colour of the robot over the form of ni@@ p@@ ples up to the type or colour of his fingers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is still disturbing , as many robots have the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which would look like a step@@ ford @-@ woman progressive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ps have developed to robots with a si@@ licon skin .
the Real@@ Bo@@ ti@@ x robot allows for example its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they will find appealing as a so@@ bri@@ ety .
and then there is still the True Comp@@ ani@@ on developed Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy Gold sex robots with pre@@ programmed personalities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which convey@@ s the impression of sh@@ tern@@ ity and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with a &quot; adventurous &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as well as possible , &quot; is the website of True Comp@@ ani@@ on .
this may be what you like , and they don &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
in the course of the day they also have their mo@@ ods - just like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; it can be tired , be fixed on con@@ vers@@ ation or it can be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in mood ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ servi@@ ent female properties that goes on rape when you take a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( is called here : resist@@ ing ) Far@@ rah is un@@ quiet one at most .
on his website True Comp@@ ani@@ on Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why do men then have no Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy ? &quot; is it on the site .
however , these sex robots are not only a fe@@ tish or simply just another sex @-@ player .
their formation and their increasing refinement point to something dar@@ ker and deeper into our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional enc@@ ore .
most men will of course keep any sex robots and while the FR@@ R noticed their increasing popularity , they remain preliminary on the edge of consumer culture .
but what passes through the edge @-@ zones can be in relation to the spirit of time in which we live , very instru@@ ctive .
and many people are not strange , or ins@@ ulting to them the free market there is permission .
there is still a certain tri@@ mmer that these highly developed sex robots come in a time when the rights of women are threatened around the world in which there is a president in the White House that has hated women to be sexually attacked .
the deter@@ rent aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the Mag@@ d &apos; ) are not the graphical images , the proper body and the broad@@ cast@@ ed eyes , but how realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment this does not feel like a big leap .
the goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( if also with Por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their builders want it to be human , that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
but , to the point , when it comes to their &quot; personalities , the robots are not a real women .

Tru@@ mp@@ s great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney to the ep@@ it@@ ome of the healthy human mind
it has become a bin@@ der of the Tru@@ mp era that the political attitudes that have pol@@ ari@@ zed the U.S. voters , have also split families in small @-@ format .
around Christmas and Ern@@ t@@ ed@@ ank@@ ant there were in the USA newspapers with advice on how to deal with the horror of Tru@@ mp relatives .
we all alle@@ ge@@ dly remember to make our filtering infl@@ atable .
less noticed is the power of Tru@@ mp@@ s , families together .
I chose this because my cous@@ ins , a linear di@@ chter@@ ine who lives in Chicago and has long been occupied with the re@@ public@@ ans in our family who visited this week in New York .
it reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with Tru@@ mp in the White House everyone knows that she knows , including the Republi@@ can relationship , with whom she fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and very peculi@@ ar on the same side .
around the dining table , this is certainly a good thing , but it falls me in a further context that this also brings considerable risks to itself .
the left was strengthened by Tru@@ mp , but the enhanced effect of his presidency has the strength to push us all to the right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when we speak of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Tru@@ mp , we refer to the great possibility that our kittens will no longer be b@@ illed to us of one day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is however a haven @-@ time scenario , in the Tru@@ mp Re@@ public@@ ans of the right wing , &quot; norm@@ alizes , &quot; which suddenly appear in comparison to its standards as a term of neg@@ ativity .
I find myself talking about an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s funny version of the backward version - the dog on the car , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax returns ) - both in comparison to Tru@@ mp in fact occur in a very mild criminal off@@ ense .
when Tru@@ mp is going , the next candidate of the Republi@@ can only be spirit@@ ually healthy to qualify as im@@ measurable improvement .
when my cous@@ in was in the city , we brought our children to the Car@@ ou@@ sel in Central Park , the largest of the Car@@ uss@@ ells of New York Park@@ department , and the best three dollars that one can spend in town if you don &apos;t need caffeine .
the horses are enormous large , the fi@@ ber@@ glass design on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are scar@@ red and the animals are turning to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climate @-@ per@@ ing music im@@ par@@ ted this in a remarkable way .
so many Kl@@ is@@ che@@ es of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of high buildings are old , the sky@@ lines become familiar to offer a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream .
twenty @-@ five years later , and I am still not quite different over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is in fact no Swiss Cottage - the theme pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not - but a great roundabout in the north of London .
the Central Park @-@ Car@@ ou@@ sel is still a strange magic experience , since two years old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women can go on it and have a great time .
if I could have had the car@@ ou@@ sel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one has asked after that .
on the other hand , I was forced to assess my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before I could pass my credit card .
in the coffee house at the corner of my road it is the same , plus the option that score a 15 % drinking - this to buy something over the counter .
this not only leads to a slow@@ ing of what is actually a neutral exchange , but also exercise pressure on the server to put personality into a situation in which no need is required .
the poor woman in the Kauf@@ haus stand exc@@ ru@@ ding , while I tired the experience made to rich my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pi@@ stor@@ y moved to the hospital in prison
Pi@@ stor@@ ius has left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time .
last year he was transferred to the hospital because of the treatment of cuts in his w@@ rists , which he suffered the prison @-@ authorities according to a case in his cell .
Pi@@ stor@@ ius has been sentenced to a first sk@@ ill@@ ary role because of murder in the prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
he killed ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning of Valent@@ ine 2013 by taking them several times by a door of the toil@@ et@@ aker in his house in Pre@@ tor@@ ia .
Pi@@ stor@@ ius said that he kept his girlfriend for a closer intru@@ der that hid in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention , this time against the six @-@ year prison sentence of Pi@@ stor@@ ius appeal , from which they say , they be too indul@@ gent .
the National Criminal Tribunal said that they will rise in the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the objection could be heard this year .
Pi@@ stor@@ ius is danger that his sentence is increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there are no death penalty in South Africa .
as Bauer Arnold is a strange egg
as the last of the Bul@@ berger schools , the neighborhoods of Fü@@ tzen and E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen were dischar@@ ged into the holidays and into the continuing schools .
three of the kidn@@ apping students go to the Gymnasium in the future , four to the Real@@ school .
Schul@@ te Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te greeted the parents and representative of the public in the civil house Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen .
as a symbol of the school@@ ing , the 29 students of the four classes elected by Sophia Schu@@ macher and Reg@@ ine Meder a young eagle , who grows in the chickens , but then released into freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for this , the m@@ lower Sch@@ ar led a Musi@@ cal with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eagle in the Chi@@ n@@ erhof . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg , and caused it to bro@@ aden it from his chicken .
instead of a chicken encounter a small eagle came out .
but hope to make out of him a chicken , the eagle spread on a high mountain of his wings and escaped .
then the classes showed three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dance .
the h@@ ens d@@ anced with the young go@@ ck@@ les , the cylin@@ ders bore to the bet .
the Eagle stands for the integration , said Schul@@ ist Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te .
the young is indeed different from the other young animals ( cows ) , belonging to this .
but he will never be like a chicken .
his purpose is to be free .
you wish all the neighborhoods , that he feels in his new school .
it followed Dan@@ kes@@ word to the colleagues , the former school manager Michael Müller , who jumping over and over again in teaching sen@@ ders , and the parents representatives .
the ch@@ ken@@ ya is now over , explained class teacher Sophia Schu@@ macher .
they leave their students after two years of lessons only very much , because it had been a really great time .
eventually , they have left themselves to the neighborhoods .
for completion , all students left a song of summer time and holiday season .
the children broke great joy in the children .
for the new school year , already eight first year are already registered .
two bul@@ gar@@ s due to illegal camping in Greece
two bul@@ s were det@@ ained because of illegal Camp@@ ings in Greece , shared the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , cited by television , with .
in the morning of August 1 , Si@@ th@@ onia was arrested by the police in Si@@ th@@ onia , including the two bul@@ gar@@ s .
on the same day they were released , while the investigation is currently running .
the State Department reported b@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were released later .

software update for diesel cars : what the ones affected must now know
how exactly will the software update take place ?
must Diesel drivers participate in the action ?
the most important questions and answers in the overview .
at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group has offered software updates for a total of about 5,@@ 3 million cars .
you should improve the gas behaviour of cars of emissions classes Euro 5 and partially Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ Diesel or bad are exemp@@ ted .
An@@ ja S@@ met@@ an@@ in of ACE Auto Club Europe provides assess@@ ments :
is the new action compulsory ?
no , the negotiated software updates are optional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the oblig@@ atory updates previously apply only to the vehicles , the Schumann &apos;s software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says An@@ ja S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their retro@@ fit has been arranged the power @-@ drive Office ( KBA ) .
how and when are customers informed about updates ?
the manufacturers announced a quick implementation in the next few months , but not yet called a precise appointment .
Daimler has communicated to writing every person concerned .
if any inspection may be due , this will be done in their frame .
how long are the change@@ over a total go ?
&quot; difficult to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ an@@ in .
the curtains , from the engagement of the manufacturers as well as from the political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for we have seen voluntarily sur@@ rendered the car manufacturers on the subject environment so far not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long shall the update last ?
the re@@ armament itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
up @-@ to @-@ up could be to get an appointment .
what do mot@@ orists do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?
the ACE is to wait for .
probably foreign manufacturers would follow , so s@@ met@@ an@@ in .
now threat@@ ens a massive price @-@ fall of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE feared this .
but even in the regions , where chassis dro@@ w dro@@ w .
in the rural area there are no valu@@ ables for older diesel .
the ACE is to wait with a sale yet .
ll C@@ ool J receives Kennedy Center award
Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first prize @-@ giving ceremony under President Tru@@ mp promises to become politically .
one of the winners will not come - from protest .
ll C@@ ool J ( 49 ) receives as the first R@@ apper one of the cov@@ eted prizes of the renowned Kennedy Center .
as the cultural sphere issued on Thursday include singer Est@@ onian Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ on@@ el Rich@@ y ( 68 ) as well as the choreo@@ grapher Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman LE@@ AR ( 95 ) .
to pass the awards at the beginning of December .
traditionally , U.S. President Donald Tru@@ mp will organize a welcome and participate together with his wife Mel@@ ania at the awarding .
the winners of progressive TV series announced the winners of E@@ AR and therefore already announced to reno@@ un@@ ce to the participation in the gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this Presidency has decided to negle@@ ct the arts and human rights - to depri@@ ve them the means - and the de@@ bit@@ es me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

we make the city worth living
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , continues next year in R@@ ente .
the site is already written - suitable candidates are ra@@ r .
since 31 years W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister .
and the work still makes him great fun , as he convey@@ s in the press conversation .
he reports from varied , but also demanding tasks that await His followers .
at the same time mar@@ vel him that so far no application will fulfil the application profile .
the city is searching for an architect or an engineer at the next time .
this is meant to be so - in compliance with the regular notice period - still enough time for an introduction .
since Has@@ lach for the Board of Directors are organised as a sub@@ regulatory authority , the applicant must pre @-@ assign the applicant .
for this function wants to keep the city in any case .
if they cannot fill it with them , the citizens would have to travel to Offen@@ burg to Offen@@ burg .
but the proximity of the city and himself is important , says W@@ acker that tells of a good working environment as well as good mood between authority and citizens .
in more than 30 years in office , some important projects have accumulated , looking back to the W@@ acker with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city worth living , he is sure about the building office and its employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future varied projects are on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the low @-@ park @-@ parking space .
the Kin@@ etic bridge between Bol@@ len@@ bach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium is still issue .
the latter alone will be@@ ating with around 1.5 million euros , &quot; if we do it right , &quot; appreci@@ ates W@@ acker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything in all wait great tasks on my successor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
gest@@ alt is much room for a Stadt@@ bau@@ meister big room .
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s own building yard and gar@@ den@@ er could react flexibly to many times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so W@@ acker , and the design of the green plants will often be praised by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the old town is known as ensemble under monument protection , whether it is important to have an eye for what clean@@ ly fit , &quot; when new buildings are approved , empha@@ sizes the cra@@ ving town masters .
anyway , the city master bears high responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is a builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end everything runs here over my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with care and coordination , he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been here for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( low @-@ depth ) for 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also , that his successor is long , wishes W@@ acker : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who truly want to be identified with the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good working environment , but also for the future design of the city .
who wants to inher@@ it Roland W@@ acker should be entitled to information about the city of Has@@ lach a completed study as graduate engineer or Bachelor with fac@@ et architecture and have good expertise in the areas of construction and construction planning .
the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt under@@ stand high @-@ and deep @-@ construction , construction planning , atro@@ cities , administration of urban property , urban tourist office with Bau@@ hof and Municip@@ al Construction Authority , including monuments .
bicycle on lines thrown : southern direction locked
according to the police , the blue @-@ known perpetr@@ ator had taken the blue bike from the train station in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) on the lines .
these were so badly damaged that the her@@ ann@@ u@@ ct@@ ant quality had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male assemblies and look for the night time after them .
near the scene , seen from witnesses a ros@@ ary sco@@ oter and a bike @-@ driver have been observed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ bu@@ ben@@ ich , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB @-@ spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch for APA . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the or the perpetr@@ ator would have brought itself into great danger and is also endangered by rail traffic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
apart from the damage to the Lo@@ k and the plant , as well as the late @-@ minute drive and the cost of rail traffic , you can also return to the offen@@ ders .
altogether , from a &quot; significant &quot; sum out , the spokes@@ person said .
the damage was fixed on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the south @-@ route could be managed without disabilities .
almost ten person@@ ages were on Friday afternoon , two of them consider the remote traffic .
Gü@@ ter@@ ings did not fell out , but they had no delay .
according to the Ö@@ BB @-@ speaker Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be exchanged around 200 meters of top lines .
ins@@ ulators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help create IB@@ D ( inflammat@@ ory intestinal diseases )
red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a night@@ mare .
but a new study suggests exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , the symptoms of patients may alle@@ vi@@ ate with anti @-@ sensitive intestinal diseases .
the incur@@ able state that affects in the US around 1.3 million and in the United Kingdom of 300@@ ,000 , causes stomach @-@ fights and mo@@ wer , recur@@ rent or bloo@@ dless diar@@ rhe@@ a , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
while the affected is usually going to chis@@ el meat and dairy products to alle@@ vi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers at the Washingtoner University showed that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han von proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant intest@@ ine .
the conduc@@ tive researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immun@@ otherapy patented in the intest@@ ine to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes , hide not into the body , not penetrate into the body .
cells which are able to dis@@ solve inflammation , become balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging the tissue .
if the balance is too far towards inflammation , it can result in a inflammat@@ ory intestinal disease .
in experiments it was found that a kind of tolerance @-@ promoting immun@@ isation in mice occurs , which carry a particular bacter@@ ium in their initiate .
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins to dis@@ solve the appearance of cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have a link between a bacterial - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice in their food had , the more they had of these immune cells .
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and one of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ rich nutrition intolerance , less inflammat@@ ory intestinal flu@@ x , if the same system also supports people .
the post@@ doctoral candidate in Dr. Luisa Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan@@ ese studied a kind of immune cell that promotes the tolerance as it found that a group of study judgments have had such cells , but another group of the same tribe that was separately accommod@@ ated , which had not had .
they suspected that the difference had to do with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ al of mice - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which usually live in the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract .
the mice of the mice have been DNA @-@ sequ@@ encing and there were six bacterial species available in mice with immune cells , but without being missing in mice .
mice have been raised in a ster@@ il@@ en environment , so that they were a intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome and they did not develop these kinds of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
to understand how the bacteria acted to the immune system , the researchers led L. to grow in a fluid and over@@ led small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on uneven immune cells that were isolated from mice .
the immune cells developed to the toler@@ ant cells .
as the active component of the fluid has been puri@@ fied , it proved to be a side @-@ product of the Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ Met@@ abol@@ ism , which is known as In@@ dol @-@ 3 @-@ Mil@@ k acid .
when the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the feed of mice , the number of such cells rose by about 50 per cent , but if the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ ov@@ aries were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cerv@@ antes Bar@@ ra@@ gan said that people have the same toler@@ ant cells such as mice , and that most of us will protect L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our stomach intestinal tract .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ side products from L. to develop the cells in people as in mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with inflammat@@ ory intestinal diseases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote , since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
potentially high tracks can lead to the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i to an extension of this population . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic has committed a &quot; genius &quot;
at Manchester United has signed an &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , believes Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der on Wednesday evening his debut at Samp@@ it had .
the 40 million pound signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday begins , and impressive in the old role as people like Paul Sz@@ am@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira to Beli@@ eben .
however , MA@@ TIC was not excluded from the preparation @-@ Asia tour of the blues and just 45 minutes said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho that he had to improve before the prime minister League season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; says M@@ our@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will help him to be ready sooner than later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
besides M@@ atic start@@ led also Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u in Avi@@ va @-@ Stadium , as M@@ our@@ in@@ ho its start @-@ XI is formed for the beginning of the season .
the Independent revealed in this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho still wanted three more re @-@ binding , but he insi@@ sted that the club has already done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfill three of its four priority re@@ mission .
&quot; three of four to get , thank you for the association , &quot; he added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four of four , but they have given great effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the pil@@ ots flew from Seattle in the US State Washington , but drawing up in Mar@@ qu@@ ette in U.S. state of Michigan , and moved into the form of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers over the US , which are several thousand kilometres .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
the shape of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers was to be the shape of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers .
the whole was an endurance for new engines .

new drau@@ ght for Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a problem
as the wind turns , when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was yet the SPD leader , the Social @-@ Democratic prime minister had always been with a certain concern to Berlin .
merely no interference from the party central , merely no counter@@ wind from the covenant - so the most important desire of the electoral fight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Martin Schulz has led the party , this has changed fundamentally . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , the employees from the Willy Brandt @-@ House has been monitoring the events of the Willy Brandt @-@ house with growing the events in the SPD &apos;s ruling towns .
what Mr Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described in the approach .
there were hol@@ dings .
and indeed one after the others .
the Confederation @-@ CD@@ U looks after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony a general signal against co@@ ali@@ tions of SPD and Gre@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows once more : red @-@ green can simply not be consistent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said CD@@ U @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the surprising fra@@ ction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gre@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) in a severe crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
five months before the election election , his red @-@ green coalition lost its red @-@ green majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green @-@ federal business leader Michael wa@@ iter has prompted the tr@@ apped Nieder@@ s@@ ächs@@ ische Green @-@ MPs El@@ ke T@@ ire to return its mandate .
the over@@ comes to the CD@@ U means a clear distor@@ tion of the elec@@ om .
El@@ ke T@@ hou must immediately return her mandate , &quot; said the Federal Business guide and election campaign of the Green Team ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sigh@@ s an SPD electoral campaign , when on Friday morning the new hi@@ list@@ ens have reached the party central . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan W@@ eil , SPD @-@ Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands after the over@@ steps of the green Members El@@ ke T@@ hou on the CD@@ U without their own governmental function .
it is the preliminary highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in the SPD country associations .
and no one knows what comes next .
the misery began with the unexpected defeat in the Saarland @-@ election in March .
a blue eye , more not , cal@@ med the comrades at the time of time .
after the country @-@ elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia everything will be different .
this was then also - and it was all distin@@ ctly worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into diving , the Düsseldorf @-@ bank@@ rupt Haute the Party smooth .
lab@@ orious break the comrades in the weeks afterwards .
then when they had just begun a new courage , the G @-@ 20 @-@ Summit of Hamburg came .
and with him the next drau@@ ght came .
Mayor Ola@@ f Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD director , lost its Nim@@ bus at that weekend because he sat in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie , while his city burned .
and because he was doing so pretty much in the crisis communication , then what you can do wrong .
since then , Sch@@ olz has been fighting for its political survival .
now also Stephan W@@ eil .
because of the VW exhau@@ st and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Israeli @-@ Sax@@ on Prime Minister has already been in criticism .
mi@@ ese re@@ frac@@ tures were added .
nevertheless , or perhaps right , tried W@@ eil in the past weeks ever stronger , to put in the Bund Ak@@ z@@ ente .
the aim of the former mayor of Hanover , his power in Berlin also remained conce@@ aled by comrades in the environment of Martin Schulz .
they let him grant him , since they talked about a stabil@@ isation of the party .
now the exact opposite could enter .
in doing so , W@@ eil on the party internal force is basically no fault .
and Schulz was not at all .
sometimes the comrades make every effort to keep their own ranks .
your wrath is directed towards the Gre@@ ens , and here especially to the apost@@ asy parliam@@ ent@@ arians in the west .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic , like Ms T@@ ires its own care@@ ers about the interests of all others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , leader of the party ham in the SPD Bundestag faction , the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ms. T@@ hou has not been elected to the parliament because of her person as a director , but on the country list of Sax@@ on Gre@@ ens in the European Parliament , so the Lower @-@ Sax@@ on MPs will continue .
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , Chief of the SPD @-@ Bundestag faction , lam@@ ents a &quot; in@@ democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the voters made four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan W@@ eil to the Prime Minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower @-@ Sax@@ on SPD as a top channel in the Bundestag &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now fal@@ si@@ fied the personal career of a future CD@@ U @-@ MEPs the W@@ ah@@ er result , &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann continued .
he asked to clarify the backgrounds .
I want to know if there has been more or there has been further commitments of the CD@@ U Lower Saxony .
funding of the local centre III
who wants to be in the years of welcome house can soon get support from the country .
more informed Mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives from St@@ eg Stadt@@ Development on Wednesday in received .
at the beginning of the information event Sch@@ ind@@ ler had once again seen a review of the previous year .
since 1991 it has been included in delicate renovation areas .
at that time , in the refur@@ bish@@ ment area I from 1991 to 2004 , the State of Baden @-@ Württemberg has taken over two thirds of the funding amount .
at the refur@@ bish@@ ment area II from 2005 to 2016 , the grant was still 60 percent .
for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the previous re@@ fr@@ actions are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is very important to promote the internal development , and not just enter new building areas .
on April 4 you will receive the information that there will be a refur@@ bish@@ ment area III .
the funding amount consumed 8@@ 33 333 euros , of which more than 500 000 Euro were received from the country , the rest of the community .
how does a refur@@ bish@@ ment be created ?
one will continue to examine as Sch@@ ind@@ ler , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are .
but it also plays a role , whether in the planned territory would be involved in any interest .
if necessary , the region can then move again as well .
the St@@ amp represented on Mit@@ tw@@ och@@ evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
cellar presented the contents of the federal states &apos; Social @-@ Programme &apos; Social City , where the refur@@ bish@@ ments were then performed .
the core of the program are the rev@@ itali@@ zation of internal cities , improving living and working conditions and maintaining the infrastructure .
the measures would object @-@ related , which is called per property , performed .
the renovation area would then finally be defined as a stat@@ ute .
the authorization period for funding has been running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
until September of this year , however , the survey would only be carried out , as part of those who were interested in filling a questionnaire on the refur@@ bish@@ ment area .
in November or December , the pro@@ posi@@ bility of the proposition is to be carried out in the coming year with the refur@@ bish@@ ments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann said that each Commun@@ e must carry out the occupied pre @-@ investigations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s why urban planning to evaluate and decide when to decide when and to what extent .
for the respective land there is also a refur@@ bish@@ ment in the basic text@@ book .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will again come again and get an impression of the situation , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Got@@ zel pointed out a key success factor for the project is the participation of the participants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , there will be questionn@@ aires that will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and will be filled out until the end of the summer holidays . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; building and real estate &quot; in which there is among other things the structural condition and the refur@@ bish@@ ment .
in the gray questionnaire , the &quot; household and housing &quot; , information can be made in size , distribution and residents of a living area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Firmware &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is only to be filled , if in the building business areas are operated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , note , Got@@ zel pointed out that a filled questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding .
furthermore , new construction measures are not eligible .
Sch@@ ind@@ ler stressed that the distribution of funding after the &quot; wind &quot; principle &quot; functional - who comes first comes first .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you cannot book a funding for later &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the conclusion , photos of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; village II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a rehabilitation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
bri@@ tish inventor sets himself a micro@@ chip in order to get into house and car with a hand@@ movement .

the advertising cost of the White House costs the tax@@ pay@@ ers .
the decision of the White House , a n@@ avy helicopter to fly South La@@ wn for an event that raises the American production last month , costs tax@@ pay@@ ers after the name of the military that were left to TI@@ ME magazine , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars .
the green white Si@@ kor@@ sky v@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board was the heart of the event on July 17 in the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tru@@ mp , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and executive officials of the White House made a tour of all the 50 states .
the helicopter @-@ helicopter was shown in addition to a yacht from Maine , a fire@@ fighter car from Wis@@ cons@@ in and a forkli@@ ft from Mississippi .
the Military Office of the White House required the presence of helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or FRA@@ GO , barely 36 hours before the helicopter on the South La@@ wn landed , according to the records of Marine Hel@@ ish@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit , which is responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; I just wanted to be aware that you are aware of it , because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; the com@@ mander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 wrote on the eve of the event of his superi@@ ors , Deputy Mar@@ ine@@ kom@@ ur for aviation .
the message showed that the helicopter arrived on 17 July at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning on the South La@@ wn for the event at 15 o &apos;clock , and until the lawn stayed there until the lawn between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening .
the note added that if the departure from the White House should be delayed , due to the limitation of the hours , a second team needed for the back flight .
the original flight appearance was during the event at the helicopter , while the security personnel of the unit stayed during the time on the ground by plane .
the records made available from the TI@@ ME were not clear whether ultimately a second flight is required .
the H@@ atch Act for@@ bi@@ ds federal states to use state property for political purposes .
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked if the event could hurt the provision .
&quot; a question that we asked , was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the command@@ ant .
&quot; sounds as if you are closed , &quot; answered the dep@@ uty com@@ mander .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not be covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also official events have political wa@@ ist .
at the event , the president gave a impetus to the reform of the health reform that was underway at the Senate , and he initiated the efforts to susp@@ ect government regulations .
the use of the plane that is known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon from politically beneficial purposes .
President are obligated to use them for travel .
but to demand their use only for a photo @-@ OP is unusual .
Tru@@ mp in February has conducted an investigation in February than the presidential plane in the background of his first campaign r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that compl@@ aining about the use of the presidential aircraft by its predec@@ essors .
&quot; the White House is enthusiastic about the show &quot; Made in America &quot; - the products from all 50 states , which are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the dep@@ uty secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters .
h@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws often lead training flights in the area around Washington and South La@@ wn by asking the US President in the White House with precise timet@@ res rates .
as a Tru@@ mp in early July at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 was conducted in the White House 58 exercises .
the flight for the &quot; Made in America &quot; event was en@@ umer@@ ated in the training needs of the flight reservation for the month , said a be@@ amer .
helicopter units also flew 11 hours to this day for &quot; non @-@ Shar@@ ed Sup@@ porting commis@@ sions . &quot;
the White House told that tax@@ pay@@ ers were the burden for none of the other re@@ pro@@ ps that were presented at the event .
a speaker of Si@@ kor@@ sky said that the company was not involved in presenting the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not have budget@@ ary design@@ ations for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to St@@ und@@ ent@@ arians of the U.S. Ministry of Defence for the fiscal year 2017 , the DO@@ D Group for the v@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per flight hour .
records of the unit record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of Marine Cor@@ ps Air Facility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of the operation of the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax pay@@ ers on the basis of estimates for the refund is highly dec@@ ep@@ tive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Pil@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs , which are included in the annual funds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a margin from 2015 , the papers for DO@@ D will not include personnel costs , but consider the cost of fuel , maintenance and contract .
at that time , the former pres@@ ses@@ ee of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ices , the use of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present these week things that are produced in America , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the State of Connecticut are proud that they contribute to our national security , and I &apos;m assum@@ ing that hundreds if not even thousands of people depend on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think the most Americans are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment , for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ ess@@ ly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is of course reasonable to highlight this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not clear whether Tru@@ mp inter@@ acting with the helicopter , when he beg@@ ged his tour over the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of fire@@ arms .
in the White House , Tru@@ mp spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and spoke with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have three of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

despite the five games still mak@@ ell@@ os@@ er Report has become the top leader of the second tennis Bundesliga to get sense of reality .
team manager Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has respect for the opponent .
&quot; this is a compact team that plays always in quite similar Formation .
especially on the back positions I find the team very well . &quot;
for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer SV , especially the imports from the high north .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even refer to bet@@ s in the Davis Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and they are also strong in the double , says Z@@ ay with a view to Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andre Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , swe@@ ar and E@@ ben O@@ reading , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas B@@ j@@ aw@@ hus ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; this is as always difficult for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so you need a good serving luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ ar team for the Trip to the high north is practical .
his debut for blue @-@ White could give maxim@@ e jan@@ four .
at the moment , the company is still running at the Chall@@ enger tournament in the Italian Bi@@ ella active French@@ man won &apos;t compete in the Bundesliga Li@@ bere@@ c spiel@@ ende Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) for his first use in this season .

he should be in Kiel as well as Bo@@ tic Van de Zand@@ voort , Niel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and the Belgi@@ ans Ju@@ lien C@@ agn@@ ina .
after his two victories last Sunday against the club at the Al@@ ster could also push Má@@ t@@ é Val@@ kus@@ z again into the team again .
it is enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary , which was in January 2016 still the number one of the J@@ uni@@ ors World tran@@ g@@ list , not , fill out someone from the coach to Mari@@ us Z@@ ay the cad@@ der .
how America can harm the O@@ MV
really happy about Donald Tru@@ mp not , when he sat on his signature under the law to tigh@@ tening the sanctions against Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his h@@ ast , the law came to en@@ acted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Congress held a few &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; constitutional rules &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels fo@@ amed against the US hegemon@@ y .
after all , the design looks to pun@@ ish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pel@@ ines into the EU .
since then , Invest@@ ors are at home in local O@@ MV , together with other European companies , the construction of the Russian Baltic Council of Nord Stream 2 .
the Dro@@ h@@ kul@@ isse is extensive .
nevertheless , it is too early for a estim@@ ation of the consequences , so the official statement of the oil concept .
in fact , Donald Tru@@ mp would have to awaken the sanctions to life even by executive order .
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has seen what the Group could dis@@ continue , and which could truly do it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nar@@ cos Staff@@ el 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el will be at the center of the heat series of Net@@ fli@@ x .

the rel@@ ays three and four were already confirmed by the streaming service , the first received its first trailer and showed the newest em@@ bos@@ sing of the show .

roll down@@ wards : the city presents 46 kitchen
the city organ@@ ises the K@@ ita @-@ noon again .
with fixed contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team .
in the urban day@@ care centres the clock is turned back .
on September 1 , the city of Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply in the urban day@@ care centres ( Kit@@ as ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , acting head in the field of youth aid , this is good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are all very pleased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cooked in addition to house : a Cat@@ erer assumes this task and provides freshly cool@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the city operates in the Kre@@ feld area 46 child daily sites , in 44 the kids will get a warm meal at noon .
in the last kitesur@@ f year , 2@@ 800 children each at the tables , and the need is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , not only children who are taken care of 45 hours of hours , in the K@@ ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour care when children remain until 14 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 divi@@ ders have served from 1 September kitchen service : they warm the angel@@ ic meals , supplement them to salad , raw material and fruit , por@@ tion@@ ing the meal individually , give the meal off , rin@@ se , rin@@ se and clean the kitchen .
&quot; the employees are firmly assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
the size - there are branches as well as the seventh facilities - decides about the circum@@ ference .
&quot; the kitchen hel@@ per now belong to the K@@ ita @-@ Team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for the K@@ ital@@ ist easier , pedago@@ gical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this is why it is about healthy eating and cooking classes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the children shall help prepare the food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen force to the team is there sensible .
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a well known power in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continuity is important for children .
the cleansing of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - so far the function of the kitchen staff - will be done in the future of special cleaning personnel .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - besides the quality improvement of the kitchen performance also has the charm that it turned out in cost @-@ right between self @-@ ra@@ ining and stran@@ gers for the city as the most economical , it means from the press office .
and that , although 46 divi@@ ders are re @-@ adjusted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours fall at some 750 people in the gu@@ ardi@@ ans area not so strong in weight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ ance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afgh@@ an democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN

elections can only be truly representative and credible when women are fully involved and involved in all parts of the election process .
Afgh@@ an elections for provincial Council and the presidential elections take place on April 5th .

GM@@ B concern about investments in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie @-@ Fabrik in Glasgow
a union would like to gather at the managers of the Bis@@ ku@@ it @-@ manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie over the long @-@ term commitment to production in Glasgow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; GM@@ B Scotland said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company spoke about the future of investments at the Tol@@ l@@ cross site . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than 500 employees work in the factory , which sets apart from other products Hob@@ bs and Rich Tea cookies .
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said , he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
he added that employees and trade union officials will learn as the first when their activities would change .
in a letter to the Fili@@ alle@@ gi@@ ans of the company called GM@@ B Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s to say &quot; concerns that funding for the modernisation of production lines will not be driven forward . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; GM@@ B @-@ Senior Organ@@ izer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that we can not gain clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tol@@ l@@ cross , concerns our members deeply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
generations of families have worked here and the workforce concentrated heavily on the local community and Greater Glasgow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage .
therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wage and prosperity , and against the background of the Bre@@ xit , the rising costs of life and of the chronic production of production , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently need a thri@@ ving production of Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ person of Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Fili@@ pino at Tol@@ l@@ cross did not get a letter from GM@@ B Scotland yesterday , and the company will react directly on it as we appreciate the continuous commitment of employees and trade union officials . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had two months ago a regular meeting with employees and GM@@ B representatives at Tol@@ l@@ cross where some questions were openly discussed .
we discussed with the employees that we operate as all enterprises that are active in an extremely competitive and non @-@ safe economic climate , our stores are constantly checked - and that applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive .
she added : &quot; in recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our Tol@@ l@@ cross location , especially in production lines and operational improvements .
we recognize the heritage of Tol@@ l@@ cross as a production site . should our factory processes change at the site , the employees and their trade union officials will be the first to find this . &quot;
does the PS@@ G Barcelona warned three years before N@@ ey@@ mar ?
the page of La League likes to rep@@ ent their interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Germain will not leave in their persecution of N@@ ey@@ mar , after having issued an offer of £ 189 million in order to resolve its free@@ wheel clause , but did they warned Barcelona three years before the world attack ?
the sensational approach has hal@@ ted the transfer window in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 @-@ Klu@@ b is ready to break the world record by more than the double of the previous brand , with Paul Sz@@ ba in the past season for 89 million pounds to Manchester United .
after finishing N@@ ey@@ mar for the most expensive player in the world and for the most affordable professional ath@@ lete of the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500@@ ,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is angry about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way to the outside , although a fountain exists near the Catal@@ ans board that the club has always been his best to take care of him since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 to take care of him .
but was the football world warned three years ago by the PS@@ G president prior to that prospect ?
as Manchester City 2014 interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for each association , who wanted to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G .
&quot; I am not worried , because they know that when they touch one of our players , then we will be in opposition to them , we will contact her players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi .
&quot; we respect all the clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign one of our players at their sign , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have exceeded this line with the Spanish club at the beginning of this summer interest in the PS@@ G @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti express .
PS@@ G made clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by lost one of their price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar .

the author and histor@@ ian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on abuse of abuse at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen continues for discussions .
Christian Weis@@ nder , spokes@@ man of the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; declared by the former Regen@@ s@@ burger Bishop and today Kar@@ d@@ inal Gerhard Ludwig Müller and by the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year brother of em@@ eri@@ ous Pap@@ al Benedi@@ ct XVI .
it would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church much when Müller and atz@@ atz@@ inger their deep regret to express their own om@@ is@@ sions or their then false estimate of processes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Vatican paper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; however critici@@ zed that in the reporting of violence in the cathedral @-@ cats with &quot; two &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; same measure &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as regards the transi@@ tions in Regensburg doubt , no one that it is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sh@@ ame@@ ful and sh@@ ame@@ ful actions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous , but the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; degree medi@@ al manipulation , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the author in Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historians , and member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics Committee . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit , the Catholic Church as a source of all evil , is already part of the everyday experience and prepar@@ es public opinion to keep it normal for normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis said in an interview with the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk : &quot; one would like to go out to the church and that &apos;s a found fres@@ co@@ es . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , she pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beats a very normal pedago@@ gical means &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in order to be finished with children as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are unfair to apply today sets standards to previous decades because the world has changed .
in connection with reports on abuse of abuse often also pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
completely wrong , author and histor@@ ian Michael Hes@@ emann , who signed with R@@ atz@@ inger the mem@@ o@@ band &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; ( in 12 languages ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he considers the results of the final report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ sided report , which has presented by Bi@@ st@@ um Regensburg with En@@ ligh@@ tenment , lawyer Ulrich Weber ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and early 1990s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with high pl@@ ore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; victims of attacks , 67 domains &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the final report it is said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg : &quot; in summary , so that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. were used in many cases physical and mental violence .
especially with high emo@@ tion@@ ality , the bri@@ g@@ ation for the students could also be fierce .
nevertheless , unlike many other accus@@ ations , there were many victims the general humanity of R. estimated and therefore in many cases have even positive memories with it in many cases . &quot;
in the interview , Hes@@ emann , why the final report on abuse of abuse at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger took his opinion .
Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 pages report on the &quot; inci@@ dents of violence against prot@@ rac@@ ers in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; gives an contradi@@ ct@@ ory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a lifting many students &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the other he also appears as a chol@@ ker and perfec@@ tionist , that was able to handle the E@@ f@@ teren hand if a domain name was not a top performance .
how do you evaluate as his bio@@ grapher this final report ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : once you take the effort and read all the 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to wonder why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger appears at all therein .
he has just been dedicated to eight pages and he is clearly acqu@@ itted from any suspici@@ on of the mid@@ - or co @-@ life with the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
also the non @-@ violence in the pre @-@ school occurred out of its effectiveness .
you can susp@@ end him at best , to find out of it too late or taken first announcements not seriously enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the domain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ her &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which he worked , was perceived by virtually all respon@@ dents than - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; salvation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; better world &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so also the wide majority of his pupils Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also presents him as &quot; warm &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competent , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; competent , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and bon@@ b@@ ons &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were surrounded by children of children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a minority compl@@ ained about its perfection and its high emo@@ tion@@ ality , which also led to W@@ ut@@ out@@ breaks .
that he kn@@ elt not only with chairs and cast the key@@ word on the ground , but also ear@@ nest@@ y guys in the hair or ears , he himself gave himself back years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ated and apologi@@ zed for it .
for his honor of honor , however , that such education methods in the question@@ able time , the 1960s and 1970s were widely used , in parents like with teachers .
do you also know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think everyone of us who was born in 1968 .
I also have experienced this in a sec@@ ular school , one state Gymnasium .
compared to what is actually happening in this report , namely the irre@@ plac@@ ental sexual abuse and non@@ violence at the pre @-@ school , are the true dre@@ ad@@ mon@@ ial .
you ask yourself whether it is not likely to do with his famili@@ arity and his role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media have just fallen upon him .
in the Bav@@ arian Pope there are many who have never understood it , still free@@ ze@@ g .
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
in the media this report was reported much about the issue of abuse at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also put in the final report any injury or co @-@ operation with regard to sexual abuse at the load ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : very clear no .
no one of the 67 victims of sexual claims asser@@ ted to become familiar to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were consecr@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have never dre@@ amed to speak with my father or my mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a subject dep@@ uty for the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrassing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the true issue in the education of sexual abuse was and is , however , that most of the victims are silent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if they don &apos;t even trust parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a ch@@ oral leaders , who would have been a colleague of the offen@@ ders .
how do Dom@@ sp@@ atzen students evaluate role in terms of abuse of abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a respon@@ dent student formed it so : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I do not see any case in which he would have had timely performance ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) and could have stayed the respective perpetrators .
I consider it ... also for really absurd to accept that there is no more urgent or more clear or more likely to be opened than to their parents , inter@@ nat@@ s@@ manager , confidence , etc .
that one speaks with him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus the report comes to the very clear outcome : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that the students involved in advance and / or their environment could not be confirmed in the framework of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is therefore free from each fellow of compassion .
he can also not be thrown at him , not prevented or brought him to the ad .
therefore there is no reason to bring its good name to these severe crimes , as unfortunately it happened in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media was much of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Non@@ stop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is presented in the report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the big problem that in the coverage was mixed and troubled to a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and non@@ violence and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
yet exactly this is a misuse of the report .
namely , there is clean separated : between the pre @-@ school and the Gymnasium of Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and non@@ violence , as well , we say once , other alleg@@ ations .
moreover , the report dealt with the report from the period since 1945 , thus also for four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not ch@@ oral leaders of the cathedral @-@ cats .
the whole gru@@ es@@ y test pedago@@ gy , the cases in which l@@ ad were scr@@ apped by sa@@ di@@ sti@@ cal teachers , and attacked them , all in the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ hofen , where truly sk@@ ill@@ ous states have to prev@@ ails .
but with those , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he got the boys first to face when they were already on the cathedral @-@ site school .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on what was the most witnesses emphas@@ ise , the theme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vor@@ schule &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one was just happy to escape her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; paradise of paradise . &quot;
what was different in the New Testament school ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there have been discipline , but there was no sa@@ vi@@ ous violence .
and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report comes to the conclusion that &quot; many victims estimates the general humanity of R. , and therefore in many cases even positive memories with it . &quot;
thus remains at most still the accus@@ ation to be taken away .
but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre @-@ school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 when he began to establish himself and was responsible for the proceedings at a school , where he didn &apos;t want to hear and responsible ( such a witness ) was not able to hear , and then again for 1993 .
loss Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently the ears consistently the ears ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the New Apostolic Church , which has even reproduced the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in it he points out that in the pre @-@ school continues to practice the audi@@ tor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even in view of the danger of negative media public opinion , he recommended urgent entries .
this was of course at a time when legal clarity existed , as audi@@ tor also banned in Bavaria too .
before that occurred they made themselves in a legal gray area , just like everyone of us know well .
since it was difficult to estimate for him , where the affected might be exagger@@ ated or dram@@ ati@@ zed and where really the permitted border had been exceeded .
but you can not say it , he always had away .
this is just not true .
only in 1980 the audi@@ tor of schools in Bavaria was officially completed in Bavaria .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis claimed to be unfair , unless the current pedago@@ gical standards apply to the then time .
how do you see that ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : we are talking about &quot; Fall@@ stri@@ ck of the An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; thus the danger , past the present moral standards .
and the inter@@ c@@ yst@@ ine has already been right .
but this of course does not apply to sexual abuse , which was ab@@ stain@@ ed at all times and also not for what was broken in the pre @-@ school to res@@ ili@@ ence and violence to inno@@ cent inf@@ ancy , which goes beyond that time far beyond that time .
this is all completely aw@@ ful and I am glad that it is finally working .
but at the same time I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because all this had nothing to do with him .
his means for discipl@@ ining and bri@@ g@@ ation , so ear@@ nest@@ y and in hair and ears were widely used in the 1970s .
as a physical existence then it has been banned , he has also strictly kept strictly to it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; which image of his rainy season has Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because in the talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
came the subject audi@@ tioned in this case also to language ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , told from his perspective , since then the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen also played a secondary role .
nevertheless , I don &apos;t know at all that he led a strict regime there .
but even this must once be said , without this perfec@@ tionist discipline , without this perfec@@ tionist discipline , it would probably hardly have been possible to form an institution of world tran@@ spl@@ its , true cultural heritage of Europe and his musical tradition , which went straight to the USA twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cuits and bondage alone , there is no big singer at all times and stand before every success , just in what field , still discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming .
what kind of people have you seen as Georg R@@ atz@@ inger on the talks about their book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : through working on the book and beyond , I met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really well and again and again as wonderful , humor@@ ous , very faithful and heart@@ felt people , one can &apos;t imagine that he could not only do a fly @-@ to @-@ man .
I regularly get along with how many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen still today , 23 years after its empowerment , regularly contact him to read it - he is almost blind - and to treat it as a member of their family .
those who do not forgive him today that he was strictly speaking to them are clearly in the minority .
most of the domain @-@ cats are grateful to him today that he enriched her life and brought to them the world of music .
and that he is always a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a lovely respect person to whom they still have a look and to worship them .
and please , once again clearly : all that one cast to him are educational methods that were at the time on the order of the day .
we can be glad we have overcome this time ago .
but it is highly un@@ just , a man , just because it is promin@@ ently and has an even more prominent brother to make medi@@ al sin@@ king .
there is the evil intention that stands behind it , only too obvious .
for the report that was just published , reli@@ eved him .
now the attack was to be a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has acquired great merits , and without the outside Bavaria and perhaps Germany no one would know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
